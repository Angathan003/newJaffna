What is Rat Fever?
Rat Fever, scientifically known as 
Leptospirosis, is a bacterial infection 
caused by the Leptospira bacteria. It is 
commonly transmitted through water or 
soil contaminated with the urine of infected 
animals, including rodents, livestock, and 
domestic pets.
How Does It Spread?
Leptospirosis spreads when individuals come 
into direct contact with:
• Contaminated Water: Swimming, wading, 
or bathing in floodwaters or stagnant pools 
contaminated by animal urine.
• Contaminated Soil: Handling soil or plants 
that may have been exposed to infected 
urine.
• Infected Animals: Handling infected or 
dead animals without proper protection.
• Through Cuts or Mucous Membranes: The 
bacteria can enter the body through cuts, 
abrasions, or mucous membranes (eyes, 
nose, or mouth).
Symptoms to Watch For
• High fever
• Severe headaches
• Muscle pain (particularly in calves and 
lower back)
• Redness in the eyes
• Vomiting and diarrhea
• Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
• Difficulty breathing or chest pain in severe 
cases
If untreated, Leptospirosis can lead to kidney 
or liver damage, meningitis, respiratory 
distress, or even death.
Who is at Risk?
• Farmers
• Fishermen
• People exposed to floodwaters
• Animal handlers
• Individuals with poor rodent control in 
their surroundings
How Can You Prevent It?
• Avoid contact with stagnant water and 
floodwaters.
• Wear protective clothing, gloves, and boots 
when handling potentially contaminated 
water or soil.
• Keep wounds and cuts covered with 
waterproof bandages.
• Store food and waste securely to prevent 
rodent infestations.
• Boil water or use water purification 
methods before drinking.
• Avoid handling dead or infected animals 
without protection.
In endemic areas, preventive medication 
may be advisable. Contact your local health 
authorities for more information.
How Is It Treated?
Leptospirosis can be effectively treated with 
antibiotics if diagnosed early. Seek medical 
attention immediately if symptoms occur after 
potential exposure.
