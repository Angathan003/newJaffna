A coconut leaf in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, heavily infested with whiteflies, showcasing the 
significant challenge these pests pose to local agriculture.
I
n recent years, Sri Lanka, especially in its 
northern regions such as Jaffna, Kilinochchi, 
Vavuniya and Mullaitivu, where the Tamil 
majority resides, has been grappling with a 
significant agricultural threat: the White Fly. 
Initially targeting mainly coconut palms, 
this pest has begun to attack various other 
traditional crops of Sri Lankan Tamils and 
possesses the potential to harm additional 
agricultural produce. This development 
is causing alarm among farmers, with 
widespread reports of infestations and notably 
reduced coconut yields. There have been 
reports of coconuts being sold at exorbitant 
prices of 120 and 150 rupees in Kilinochchi, 
a place known for its relatively lower prices, 
thanks to the abundance in the region.
Though minuscule whiteflies pack a 
devastating punch in the world of agriculture

Crisis in Sri Lanka's Coconut Plantations

and gardening. Resembling tiny, fluttering 
snowflakes, these pests are far from benign. 
They belong to the family Aleyrodidae, and 
scientists report there are hundreds of species, 
with the greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes 
vaporariorum) and the silverleaf whitefly 
(Bemisia tabaci) being particularly notorious.
Whiteflies extract plant juices, leading to the 
weakening of plants. Signs of heavy infestation 
include yellowing, drying, and premature 
dropping of leaves. Furthermore, these pests 
are vectors for crop viruses, exacerbating their 
impact and can significantly reduce yield.
High officials from the Coconut Research 
Institute note that globally, approximately 1500 
species of White Fly exist, with four species 
particularly threatening to Sri Lanka's coconut 
palms. These include the Palm-infesting 
whitefly, Citrus-nesting whitefly, Spiralling 
whitefly, and Coconut whitefly. The  Spiralling 
whitefly in Sri Lanka dates back to 1990 when 
it was initially perceived as a minor pest for 
coconuts compared to other crops.
The first significant outbreak in Sri Lanka's 
coconut plantations occurred in 2019, 
originating in the Kegalle District. Factors 
such as illegal importation of Palmae group 
seedlings, climate change impacts, and a 
drop in natural predators due to excessive 
insecticide use on other crops are thought to 
be contributing causes.
These flies have since spread to various 
districts, exacerbating problems like the 
Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt disease. A 
diverse range of plants, including banana, 
guava, citrus, avocado, and many more, serve 
as hosts for the White Fly, underscoring the 
wide-reaching nature of this issue.
Scientists recommend various control 
measures, including yellow sticky traps 
and insecticides like Neem oil and soap 
mixture, Thiomethoxam, Carbosulfan, and 
a combination of Chlorantraniliprole and 
Thiomethoxam.
 The Neem oil and soap mixture is remarkably 
advised for its lower toxicity to the natural 
enemies of whiteflies, while artificial 
insecticides are suggested for newly infested 
areas and coconut seedling nurseries.
In addition to chemical solutions, the search 
for biological control methods is ongoing. 
The involvement of international expertise in 
importing exotic natural enemies of the white 
fly illustrates the collaborative efforts to curb 
this pest.
Through coordinated efforts encompassing 
awareness, chemical and biological control, 
and international cooperation, there is hope 
to mitigate this crisis and safeguard the 
livelihoods of farmers and the health of Sri 
Lanka's agricultural sector.
Recently, the Coconut Cultivation Board 
initiated an experimental effort in Jaffna 
to control White flies by increasing the 
population of their natural predators, 
including certain insects and bees. The 
results of this experiment are expected to 
be evident soon. The Board authorities have 
stated that owners of coconut trees affected</p>

by the White flies can seek solutions from 
the Coconut Cultivation Board. It is reported 
that a division of the Board is operational 
in each regional agricultural service station, 
where affected individuals can submit their 
complaints. However, it is emphasized that 
the issue of White flies cannot be resolved 
through individual efforts or by a few farmers 
alone. The menace of White flies is a collective 
challenge affecting entire areas. If controlled 
in one house, the White flies may reappear 
after a short period from a neighbouring 
house. Therefore, it is crucial to address this 
issue through a community-wide collective 
effort, as the relevant departmental authorities 
recommended.
A few social enthusiasts have highlighted 
that the Tamil community has already lost a 
significant number of Mull Murukku (Indian 
coral tree) trees. In Tamil culture, the Mull 
Murukku holds a highly auspicious place and 
is an integral part of weddings, specifically 
during the 'Kannikaal' ritual. This ritual in Sri 
Lankan Tamil weddings involves planting a 
specially prepared stick in the courtyards of 
both the bride's and groom's homes. However, 
this species is becoming endangered due to 
diseases affecting the Mull Murukku and the 
consequences of urbanization.
Botany departments exist in higher education 
institutions within the Tamil community. 
Given the irreplaceable role of Mull Murukku 
in Tamil culture, questions arise as to why 
experts or scholars in these departments 
haven't been able to save it. In recent times, 
some weddings have seen Croton plants and 
drumstick tree sticks replacing Mull Murukku, 
leading people concerned about cultural 
preservation to wonder if an alternative for 
coconuts might also be necessary in the future.
These concerned individuals also emphasize 
that appropriate, field-specific research is 
crucial to address the issue of White flies and 
prevent coconut trees from disappearing like 
the Mull Murukku. The northern and eastern 
regions, suitable for dry zone agriculture, 
currently lack a dedicated coconut research 
centre. Therefore, it is suggested that a research 
centre focusing on coconut cultivation, 
appropriate for these areas, should be 
established.</p>
