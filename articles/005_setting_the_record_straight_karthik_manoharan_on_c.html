A
mid various unfounded claims circulated 
by certain Indian politicians and overseas 
representatives of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE), suggesting the possible resurgence 
of Velupillai Prabhakaran, Manoharan, the elder 
brother of Prabhakaran, along with his son Karthik 
Manoharan, have announced their intention to 
conduct a public memorial. This decision has 
been taken to quell the speculative narratives that 
Prabhakaran and his family are still alive. The 
Manoharan family is also preparing to hold a public 
'thithi', a ceremony on the day in the lunar 
calendar marking the death anniversary 
of Velupillai Prabhakaran, his wife 
Mathivathani, their eldest son 
Charles Anthony, daughter 
Thuvaraga, and youngest 
son 
Balachandran, 
thereby aiming to bring

closure to these persistent rumours.
The Velupillai family's recent initiative serves 
to conclusively address and dispel the baseless 
rumours that have been circulating, suggesting 
that Prabhakaran's family survived the final 
stages of the conflict. This step is particularly 
focused on putting an end to the misleading 
claims about Thuvaraga's survival and the 
consequent solicitation of significant funds 
from the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora in Europe, 
Canada, and other nations. The family's action 
is a direct response to these ongoing deceptions 
and aims to bring a sense of closure to these 
unfounded narratives.
In a recent interview with Jaffna Monitor, Karthik 
Manoharan, nephew of Prabhakaran and the 
son of Prabhakaran's elder brother Manoharan, 
provided insights into the upcoming Memorial 
Day dedicated to Prabhakaran's family.
What are the motivations behind 
organizing the memorial day..?

The decision to commemorate my uncle Prabhakaran's family 
arises from a series of unfortunate events. On February 13, 
2023, misinformation propagated by the group led by Tamil 
Nadu politician Pazha Nedumaran, which falsely claimed 
that my sister Thuvaraga is alive, alongside videos released 
by my Aunt Mathivathani's sister, Ms Aruna, supporting 
Pazaha Nedumaran's claim, resulted in a gross dishonour to 
the legacy of my uncle and his family. These actions have not 
only disrespected their memory but have also been linked 
to financial malpractices carried out under the guise of my 
uncle Prabhakaran's name.
We are forced to take decisive steps to halt such unscrupulous 
activities and safeguard against their recurrence. This 
memorial event is a necessary measure to curtail the ongoing 
fraudulent exploitation and misuse of my uncle's name for 
financial profit. Through this event, we aim to appropriately 
commemorate the brave lives and the valorous sacrifices of 
my uncle Prabhakaran and his family on the battlefield.

Some politicians and profiteers 
perpetuate the narrative that 
Prabhakaran is still alive and 
will return. Do you believe your 
announcement will significantly 
counter their business plans in 
Prabhakaran's name?
There are many ways to live. Rather than 
resorting to deceit and falsehoods by falsely 
claiming that my uncle Prabhakaran and his 
family members will return, those who exploit 
this narrative for financial gain should consider 
more honest means of livelihood. They could 
opt to seek assistance if in poverty or strive 
to earn their living honourably through hard 
work. Otherwise, they might as well resort to 
begging on the streets. There's nothing we can 
do about it. 
On what basis did you conclude that 
your uncle Prabhakaran and his 
family are no longer alive?
The enduring hope that Uncle Prabhakaran's 
family might one day return has been a 
sentiment deeply rooted in our hearts for many 
years. Yet, as time progressed, this belief began 
to wane in light of various developments. The 
year 2023 marked a turning point, extinguishing 
even the faintest glimmers of this hope. Those 
who claim that my uncle Prabhakaran, Aunt 
Mathivathani, and sister Thuvaraga are still alive 
have consistently failed to provide any concrete 
evidence or public appearance to substantiate 
their assertions. Instead, these individuals 
allege that my uncle's family has chosen to live 
away from the public eye. However, one must 
question the rationale behind this prolonged 
absence; if their claims were true, why would 
they not continue the same silence they have 
maintained over the past 14 years? It is now 
with a heavy heart that I have come to accept 
the likely reality: my uncle Prabhakaran and his 
family achieved martyrdom on the battlefield 
during the final war in 2009.
