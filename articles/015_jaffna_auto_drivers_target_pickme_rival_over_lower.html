A 
PickMe auto driver was reportedly 
assaulted outside the Jaffna Teaching 
Hospital, highlighting escalating tensions 
between traditional auto drivers and PickMe 
service providers. The driver, who lodged a 
formal complaint at the Jaffna Police Station, 
alleges that law enforcement failed to take 
appropriate action following the attack.
The incident appears to be a symptom of 
the growing frustration among traditional 
auto drivers in Jaffna, driven by the rise of 
PickMe—a ride-hailing app that has disrupted 
the local auto industry with its competitive 
pricing. Before PickMe's arrival, auto fares 
in Jaffna were notoriously high, with short 
trips, such as those from Jaffna town to nearby

Target PickMe Rival 
Over Lower Fares
Growing Friction: 
Monitor Memo</p>

areas like Kokuvil or Kondavil (within a 5 km 
radius), typically costing between LKR 1,000 
and 1,200. The introduction of PickMe has 
significantly lowered these rates, cutting into 
the income of many traditional drivers, who 
are now expressing anger and hostility toward 
PickMe drivers.
The victim recounted the events that led to the 
assault: "Outside the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, 
a passenger booked my service through the 
PickMe app. As I arrived to pick them up, 
another auto driver at the stand intervened, 
preventing the passenger from boarding my 
vehicle. Then, he physically assaulted me."
Despite reporting the incident, the PickMe 
driver claims that the police response was 
inadequate. "I filed a formal complaint at the 
Jaffna Police Station. Although the attacker was 
summoned, the female officer conducting the 
inquiry appeared biased and hostile towards 
me. She seemed to side with the attacker, who, 
during the inquiry, even threatened to harm 
me in her presence. I had no choice but to 
leave the station without a proper resolution," 
he added.
The driver has since expressed his intention to 
escalate the issue to senior police officials, as 
no satisfactory action has yet been taken.
This incident sheds light on the broader 
resentment among traditional auto drivers, 
whose incomes have been severely affected 
by PickMe's competitive pricing. Many 
local drivers, who previously benefited from 
charging higher rates, are increasingly voicing 
their anger over the growing presence of 
PickMe. This growing friction has led to 
several incidents, like the one outside the 
hospital, as drivers struggle to maintain their 
livelihoods.
While he won't be on the ballot, 
Wigneswaran's presence will remain ever-
present in the background.
His "political service" isn't ending, either. 
According to Wigneswaran, Tamil politics 
simply cannot thrive without his ongoing 
wisdom and experience. If there's one thing 
as enduring as Wigneswaran's career, it's his 
belief that his guidance is essential to the 
political landscape.
As leader of the Tamil People's National 
Alliance, Wigneswaran emphasized that 
the party's primary goal is to protect Tamil 
nationalism and secure the rights of the Tamil 
people. He noted that the party has been 
blending the wisdom of experienced leaders 
(such as himself) with the "boundless energy" 
of younger members to advance their political 
agenda. He proudly reminded the public 
that in the last parliamentary election, voters 
placed their trust in him, sending him to 
Parliament.
Now, at the age of 84, Wigneswaran believes 
it's time for the "old guard" (himself included) 
to step aside and create space for younger, 
dynamic members of the party. He urged 
other senior politicians to follow his lead 
by mentoring the next generation. He plans 
to remain active within the Tamil People's 
National Alliance and continue to guide 
younger candidates.
So, at the tender age of 84, Wigneswaran is 
passing the torch to the next generation—but 
not without making sure everyone knows he's 
still holding on to a part of it.
Wigneswaran....</p>

and shut it with a little plank and stood up. 
Her hands propped up her waist and helped 
her to stand up.
"Looks like there's some smoke by the 
riverside," she mumbled and rubbed her eyes. 
"It's true. The village is alight!" She realised 
what was happening. Excitedly, she dragged 
her paralysed left leg and entered the hut. She 
could not see anything. "Where did I keep 
the damned matchbox?" Her hand found it as 
she fumbled through. The 'fireling' that was 
entrapped in the matchbox seated itself on the 
'cup lamp'.
There was hardly anyone in the village who 
did not know auntie. She had many names 
such as gardener auntie, chit-bond auntie 
and pottery auntie. If there was a nickname 
that ends with auntie, it certainly refers to 
this auntie also known as Meeralebbe Avvaa 
Ummaa. All these names belonged to auntie 
alone in the village and represented bonds that 
had struck root and spread wide.
When the sun had risen barely two degrees 
over the eastern horizon, she would enter the 
village with the help of her stick. Manoeuvring 
her bowed legs, she will get in and out of</p>

every house in the village. She will go along 
Vembukkaarande Road, turn at the Paalaiyadi 
junction, get on to Marungaikkeni Road and 
walk along Union Road and enter the garden.
It was the same routine today as well. She had 
gone a full round through the village without 
missing a single house. Her situation was not 
bad: she had nearly seven measures of rice. 
Besides they had issued relief this week, raw 
broken rice bits in the name of rice. "No curry 
will go with this broken rice bits. If I add a 
piece of dried fish to some thiraay leaves and 
stir fry, I may be able to eat two morsels."
She poured the rice into the pot and started 
to boil water for the tea. It was then that the 
sound penetrated her ears. 'Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-
tat-tat-tat-ta.' 
"It was really the sound of the boys firing their 
guns. The trouble that these kafirs make... As if 
that is not enough our god-forbidden kids too 
have joined in."
"Boom! Bang!"
"Oh my god! The bomb probably has dropped 
inside the
garden." Both her ears were ringing.
The cock and the hen sobbed as they sat back 
inside the cage.
"Even last night the boys came draped with 
weapons. Even after getting used to seeing it, 
my liver felt scorched."
"What is the matter son? It looks as if the 
fighting has started?" she asked and Buhari 
clapped his hands and laughed, "Phooh! Is this 
a battle? It will be all over in two hours!"
"He must have had something in his mind 
when he laughed. Real man-eaters."
"They usually leave their guns inside this 
hut and go into the village with one or two 
weapons. I was suspicious when they took 
all the weapons with them last night." Auntie</p>

poured some sugar on her palm, touched the 
sugar carefully with her outstretched tongue, 
widened her lower lip, and tapped the upper 
gums with the sugar and as she sipped the tea 
sweetened by that sugar. "Boom! Bang!" Sand 
flung on her face.
"Oh Lord Mohideen!" auntie screamed. Her 
body shuddered in fear.
Auntie could not notice anything and she did 
not realise that the sari that she had wrapped 
over her skirt had fallen off. She left everything 
as it was, and she came out and looked, stick 
in hand and dragging her paralysed leg. The 
airship in the sky going round and round the 
village took a nosedive and it seemed that it 
would fall on the garden. Frightened, auntie 
glued herself to the manjona tree.
"Bang... Boom!"
"The airship is dropping bombs. The village 
will not be spared."
"Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-ta."
"It seems that the boys are shooting as well."
When auntie was a young girl, she has seen 
airships drop bombs in Kalkudah. "The 
Japanese came in rows of airships. The ship 
belonging to the queen's country sank off 
Kalkudah." Old memories came to auntie's 
mind with blasts of sound from the AK 47s, 
and passed as flashes of lightning. It was then 
that she realised what was going on. "There 
was not a soul around in the colony," and a 
pestle started to pound within her chest.
"I did not hear the call for prayer from the 
mosque. Is Allah's mosque too in trouble? Oh 
Rahman, what harm has befallen this world?" 
auntie sighed.
"Gardener auntie, run along... The army folk 
have arrived... Everyone is going into the 
mosque." The sound that came floating in the 
air bit her ear. She did not feel comfortable to 
leave her hut.
"The pot of rice, the can of coins, sugar, tea, 
pots and pans and even the brown cock will be 
taken away." They comprised auntie's wealth.
"The Tamil riot a few years ago also started in 
this fashion. I left behind all my belongings 
and in the end they cleaned off everything, 
including the pot for making tea. Because 
of the accursed scoundrels I have no way of 
dying in peace in one place." Bitterness filled 
her.
She got into action. She tilted the pot and 
poured a coconut shell full of water on to 
the stove that she lit a while ago and put 
out the fire in one go. Smoke rose from the 
extinguished fire and covered auntie's face. 
She rubbed her eyes and closed the thatched 
door shut. "Let Allah take care." With sad 
disgust rising from the bottom of her heart, 
and leaving everything in the charge of Allah 
who created all, she stepped past the barbed 
wire fence. It was only as she stepped on to the 
road that everything became clear to her.
Everyone was leaving with his or her little 
ones, carrying whatever one could grab hold 
of. "I have a bad leg and, if I do not have even 
this stick, I am finished." Sighing, she walked 
as fast as she could.
"It has gone dark..." Auntie's eyesight was a 
little weak.
"Bang... Boom!" It was like a thunderbolt close 
to auntie who was limping on. The shock 
made the stick jump off her hand. "Allah, hei...
ii" Auntie's legs tripped and she fell face flat 
on the road. Fortunately she had not hurt her</p>

head. There was a burning sensation from the 
elbows and the knees that had scraped on the 
road.
The whole village went past auntie. Not 
one took a look at her. When she regained 
consciousness, she could hear the sound of the 
odd person passing along the road.
"Did I trip when I was passing Moulana 
vaappaa?" Her heart responded, "Yes! Yes!" 
Auntie looked up. The white walls of Moulana 
vaappaa's house shed light on her eyes. "I told 
Moulana vaappaa long ago of the might of the 
state and that is why he has left the village with 
his family. It is because blessed ones like him 
have left that the village is in this state". She 
hailed Moulana vaappaa in her mind.
"Son! Who is it vaappaa that is passing?" A 
figure with a sack on its shoulder passed half 
running and half walking past auntie.
"Mammalivaa... son Mammalivaa... son, I am 
gardener auntie. Please give me a hand, vaapaa, 
you blessed one..."
"Is not Mammalivaa's house adjoining 
Moulana vaapaa's? There is not a sound," the 
mind wondered. "Child, Rosaammaa, will 
not you at least give me a hand... Child, I too 
am a creation of Allah. Why is everybody 
abandoning me?" Auntie started to moan and 
sob. She transferred her entire strength to her 
hands and managed to sit up on the road.
She heard the clanging of the bells of a bullock 
cart past Paalaiyadi junction. "Thambi, who is 
it vaapaa? Thambi I am gardener auntie. Can 
you take me too on the cart, son?"
In that area, only Ahmed Lebbe had a cart with 
a pair of bullocks. Auntie was familiar with the 
two animals.
"Son, don't both your bulls graze in my garden. 
Why isn't even one of you children taking a 
look at me?"
"Allah! Will I suffer this plight if I had my</p>

son? During the last riots someone 
had kidnapped him, the boy who 
went to fish at Puliyadiththurai. Even 
if my son was stupid Allah, why are 
you torturing this soul?" Desperation 
overcame auntie. No one seemed to 
take any notice of her.
 "Ungrateful creatures. Even a dog 
would have looked back for all this 
sound."
"How many times would I have 
quenched the fire in their bellies by 
bringing down bunches of young 
coconut. In the end, there is not one 
person to lift me by my hand..."
"The kafirs of Karuvaakkeni are a lot 
better than them. If Thambiaiyah 
would only come this way, he would 
lend me his hand."
"Our folks have got used to opposing 
the might of the state. Eaters of 
haraam."
"All this is Allah's angry look..." Auntie, 
while seated on the road, swung her 
hands in search of the stick. Her 
watering eyes turned cloudy. "My 
garden will not survive this trouble. It 
was like this during the last riot too. 
The haraangkuttis of Karuvaakkeni set 
the hut alight."
"I was able to rebuild the hut with the 
relief money that the AGA gave me. 
How long is it since this trouble started 
and how long will it be before it ends?"
"This is not a world that is to be any 
good... It is one to be damned." Auntie 
struggled with her thoughts. The 
village quietened and turned mum like 
a snake that was struck down.
Auntie's tummy started to grumble. There was 
nothing inside. Hunger and thirst... It seemed that 
fear and confusion chasing each other would gobble 
her up. Hunger as fierce as fire... "The piece of dried 
fish and manioc that I bought from Umarkkutti's 
shop. I could have made a gravy, cooked rice and 
eaten by now," auntie savoured the saliva that welled 
in her mouth.
Far away, from the direction of Karuvaakkeni, a 
vehicle was speeding along. The glare hurt auntie's 
eyes. "Really it is the jeep of our boys that is coming. 
How often have I made pots and pots of tea for 
them? Perhaps, they will somehow stop and give me 
a hand."
Auntie tightened her skirt. The vehicle that speeded 
towards auntie took no notice of her and vanished 
in the direction of Kinnaiyadiththurai.</p>
