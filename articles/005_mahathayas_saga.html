Mahathaya's Saga:
cover story
Power, Paranoia, and 
Politics in the LTTE

Mahathaya and Prabhakaran: 
A Bond Beyond the Battlefield
Mahathaya (Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja), Once a prominent figure 
within the LTTE and seen as the deputy leader and public face of 
the organization, faced a dramatic downfall when he was arrested in 
August 1993 by the LTTE itself. He was accused of colluding with

India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in a plot to 
assassinate Prabhakaran and other key LTTE leaders. 
After enduring 16 months of captivity, Mahathaya was 
executed on December 28, 1994. This year marks the 
29th anniversary of his execution.
The arrest of Mahathaya, coupled with the allegations 
leveled against him, sparked widespread speculation 
and disbelief among observers and LTTE supporters 
alike, particularly considering his previously close 
relationship with Prabhakaran. His fall from grace and 
the subsequent execution were seen as indicative of 
the complex and often perilous internal politics of the 
LTTE.
Credible sources who were formerly associated with 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have 
shared in-depth insights with the Jaffna Monitor, 
shedding light on the complex dynamics that led to the 
downfall of Mahathaya. According to these sources, a 
key factor in Mahathaya's decline was the combination 
of LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran's insecurities 
and paranoia, along with the intense paranoia about 
the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India that 
had enveloped Pottu Amman, the head of LTTE's 
intelligence wing. These sources also highlighted Pottu 
Amman's ambition to climb the ranks within the 
LTTE, which significantly influenced the unfolding 
events. Following Mahathaya's downfall, Pottu 
Amman rose to a position of greater power, becoming 
the undeclared but effective second-in-command 
of the LTTE, a role that Mahathaya had previously 
occupied. 
Mahathaya, once a trusted deputy of the LTTE leader 
Prabhakaran, shared a deep connection with him that 
extended beyond their roles in the organization. Both 
hailed from Valvettithurai, a significant location in 
the Sri Lankan armed struggle, belonged to the same 
caste, the Karaiyar caste (Traditionally, the Karaiyar 
were known as a seafaring and fishing community), 
and were alumni of Chidambaram College. Their close 
association was also marked by their proximity in age, 
with Prabhakaran born in 1954 and Mahathaya in 
1956, leading some to speculate about their familial 
relationship.
Mahathaya's journey with the LTTE began in 1978 and 
was significantly influenced by Prabhakaran. He was 
personally chosen by Prabhakaran to join the ranks of 
the LTTE. Initially known within the LTTE as 'Sri,' and 
'Ajit'. Mahathaya's identity evolved over time. A source 
who interacted with him extensively in India between 
1981 and 1983 disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor that 
he was known as 'Sri' during this period. However, by 
1985, he had become widely recognized as 'Mahathaya' 
within the LTTE circles. A former prominent member 
of the LTTE disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor that 
Mahathaya was also known by the nickname 'Mokku' 
Mahathaya. The term' nkhf;F (Mokku) in Tamil is 
often used colloquially to describe someone who is 
dumb or an idiot. 
There is a common misconception regarding how 
Mahathaya came to be known by his name, which in 
the Sinhala language means "sir," a term of respect. 
Contrary to the belief that he acquired this name after 
leading peace talks with the Premadasa Government 
in 1989, sources who worked closely with Mahathaya 
have clarified that he was actually referred to as 
Mahathaya as early as 1984.

Mahathaya and the LTTE: 
Unconventional Training and 
Indian Government's Role
Contrary to popular belief, Mahathaya did not receive 
formal military training in any of the LTTE's official 
training batches. The first military training camp for 
LTTE cadres was conducted in Udayarkattu, located in 
the Mullaitivu District, during February, March, and 
April 1983. This pioneering training camp was led by 
none other than the LTTE chief Prabhakaran himself. 
About 25 members participated in this initial training 
session. Among the attendees were several prominent 
LTTE figures including Kittu, Pottu Amman, Sellakili, 
Ponnamman, Pulendran, and Lala Ranjan. It's 
important to highlight that at this time, the LTTE was 
still a relatively small guerrilla group, comprising no 
more than 30 members. Sources present at this first 
camp told the Jaffna Monitor that, although 
Mahathaya was seen a few times at the campsite, 
he did not participate in the training. 
Following the 1983 violence, the Indian 
government under Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi covertly provided military training 
to various Tamil militant groups from Sri 
Lanka, including the LTTE. The first two LTTE 
training camps, conducted in Uttar Pradesh 
and Jawalamukhi in the Kangra district of 
Himachal Pradesh, North India, were part 
of this clandestine operation. These sessions, 
known within the LTTE as batch-1 and batch-2, 
featured direct training from Indian Army 
personnel. This secret military assistance was a 
component of a broader initiative by the Indira 
Gandhi government to offer similar training to 
other Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups, though 
in different locations
The first batch of LTTE cadres sent to India for 
military training was kept unaware of their exact 
location, a strategy by the Indian government 
and RAW to maintain discretion. The secrecy 
surrounding the training was crucial due to the 
sensitive implications of providing arms training 
to a foreign militant group. The militants were 
transported via long routes and isolated from 
the public to ensure confidentiality and prevent 
potential future disclosures. While the trainees 
were aware that they were in Uttar Pradesh, the exact 
location of their training site was deliberately kept 
undisclosed. 
Similarly, the second batch of LTTE cadres sent for 
training was covertly transported. They embarked on a 
two-day bus journey from Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin 
railway station, taking a deliberately longer route to 
maintain secrecy. Ingeniously, two trainees from this 
batch, Raheem and Suseelan, managed to deduce 
their location. They identified their whereabouts as 
'Jawalamukhi,' a small village in the Kangra district of 
Himachal Pradesh, by noting the name on a post office 
board. It's worth noting that Suseelan, recognized 
for his mechanical skills, was later tragically killed 
following the Mahathaya case within the LTTE. 
Additionally, insiders from these training batches 
confirmed that Mahathaya was not a participant in 
these training sessions.
