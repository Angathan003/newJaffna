Chemmani: Where 
Justice Was Buried
The dead do not speak - but the earth does
A few years ago, I visited Cambodia. My original 
aim was to see the Angkor Wat temple complex. But, 
as always, my journalistic instincts led me deeper - 
into rural Cambodia, where I found myself in quiet 
conversations with a few former soldiers of the Pol 
Pot regime, now living ordinary lives as toddy tappers, 
farmers, and small shop owners.
One of them - a former henchman of the Khmer 
Rouge - opened up after a few glasses of toddy. In 
a hauntingly calm voice, he described how they 
were ordered to kill anyone seen as an enemy of 
the communist revolution. And then, with a chilling 
emptiness in his eyes, he told me how they would fry 
and eat the pancreas of the dead at night, washing it 
down with country-made rice wine.
As he poured himself another drink, he leaned closer 
and said: "You know, there’s a saying in Cambodia - 
The dead do not speak - but the earth does."
He paused, his voice dropping to a whisper: "It means, 
wherever you dig - to build a house, to dig a well, 
even a toilet - you may unearth human remains. That’s 
how we wreaked havoc on this land," he confessed, 
with a strange mixture of guilt and detachment. That 
grim truth - the dead do not speak, but the earth does 
- is not Cambodia's alone. Once again, the cursed 
soil of Jaffna's Chemmani has whispered its dreadful 
testimony: "We are no different."

Nineteen skeletons - or rather, 
nineteen souls
Nineteen skeletons - or rather, nineteen 
souls who once breathed, loved, 
and hoped. Among them, the fragile 
remains of an infant - tiny bones that 
never had the chance to grow, a life 
extinguished before it could even 
begin to grasp the world's cruelty. 
This baby knew nothing of the LTTE. 
Nothing of the Sri Lankan Army. 
Nothing of politics, flags, or ethnic 
divisions. Its only "crime" was being 
born from a Tamil mother's womb - in 
a land where, for some, that alone was 
enough to seal their fate.
How many more silent graves lie 
beneath the bloodied earth? How many 
more infants, neonates, and mothers 
will emerge as we peel back the layers 
of dirt that have long concealed Sri 
Lanka's crimes? The question hangs 
heavy - and the earth, patient and 
merciless, will keep answering.
When a Schoolgirl’s Death 
Exposed a Nation’s Machinery of 
Death
The story does not begin with 
excavations. It begins with the 
savage destruction of an 18-year-
old girl's dreams. On September 7, 
1996, Krishanthi Kumaraswamy - a 
brilliant student of Chundikuli Girls' 
College who dreamed of becoming a 
doctor - was dragged from a military 
checkpoint into a nightmare that would 
expose the industrial-scale machinery 
of death operating in Sri Lanka's north.
Eleven uniformed predators gang-
raped this young woman, dismembered 
her, and buried her broken body like 
garbage in a shallow pit. When her 
16-year-old brother Pranavan, her 
mother Rasamma, and family friend 
Kirupakaramoorthy dared to search for 
her, they too were abducted, butchered, 
and dumped into Chemmani's cursed 
soil.
But Krishanthi's murder refused 
to vanish into the abyss of state-
sponsored denial that had swallowed 
thousands of other Tamil lives. Too 
many people had seen her stopped 
at that army checkpoint. She was a 
schoolgirl from an educated, respected 
family; the community could not be 
silenced. Her brutal killing became 
a burning torch that illuminated the 
machinery of darkness through which 
the Sri Lankan state conducted its 
campaign of mass killings.
Testimony Written in Blood
I know these horrors not as distant 
headlines, but as memories that live 
within my own blood. During the same 
period when the Chemmani atrocities 
were unfolding, I once accidentally 
met a distant relative of mine. She was 
performing adiyadithal - a painful vow 
where the devotee repeatedly prostrates 
around the temple premises, pleading 
with the gods - at Nallur Veeramakali 
Amman Temple.
One round itself is exhausting, but 
she was doing three rounds every 
day. She was visibly drained. When I 
gently asked her why she was doing</p>

this, she whispered that her younger 
brother had been taken by the military 
for "investigation" and had not yet 
returned. She was invoking the divine, 
hoping against hope that her brother 
might somehow return alive. But to 
this day, he never came home. His 
fate remains unknown, perhaps lying 
beneath one of the very mass graves 
we are now unearthing. His sister still 
waits - waiting for a brother who will 
never again walk through her door.
Another distant relative - a widow 
whose only son, an innocent young 
man who was the center of her world 
- watched helplessly as military 
personnel arrested her boy. Unlike my 
other relative, her son was eventually 
released after several weeks of 
detention. When he returned home, his 
grieving mother thought her prayers 
had been answered. But the young 
man who came back was not the same 
boy who had been taken. For days, he 
vomited and passed blood, his body 
carrying the invisible scars of whatever 
horrors he had endured in custody.
Within a few days, he died.
Even now, I can still hear the raw, 
haunting screams of his mother at his 
funeral - a sound that never fades. The 
kind of wailing that pierces your soul, 
a grief so deep it leaves you gasping in 
helpless rage.
I remember when my own family - like 
thousands of others - was displaced as 
the Army captured Jaffna in late 1995 
and early 1996. President Chandrika 
Kumaratunga had ordered a massive 
military operation to recapture the 
peninsula, and the Army advanced 
with overwhelming force. But the 
LTTE, unwilling to allow the military 
a propaganda victory by capturing 
Jaffna with its civilians inside, ordered 
the entire population to evacuate. They 
wanted Chandrika to capture a ghost 
city - and, of course, they wanted to 
keep the people with them, a brutal 
strategy they employed until their final 
days in Mullivaikal. As the Tamil poet 
Sugan would later write, "Prabhakaran 
took even the 80-year-old grandmother 
from Jaffna for his safety."
We became part of that endless stream 
of displaced souls. For six months, we 
lived scattered and uprooted, uncertain 
of where life would take us next. Later, 
as the LTTE moved its operations 
into the Wanni jungles, they urged 
the displaced families to follow. I still 
recall - I was just a child - standing, 
if I remember correctly, somewhere 
near Chavakachcheri, where LTTE 
cadres stopped us, warning: "If you go 
back, your sons will be tortured, your 
daughters will be raped."
But like Krishanthi's family, and like 
many others who badly wanted to go 
back to Jaffna - and perhaps still clung 
to a fragile hope in the Sri Lankan state 
- we chose to return to Jaffna.
And I also know - because I have seen 
it with my own eyes - how this one 
heinous crime of raping and murdering 
a schoolgirl terrified hundreds of Tamil 
youth across Jaffna. Many of them, 
broken and enraged, eventually joined 
the LTTE with one desperate purpose: 
to defend the dignity of their sisters, at 
a time when the state itself had become 
the predator - or, worse, the concealer 
of predators.</p>

Among them was a fragile youth - a boy 
people used to joke about, saying he 
couldn’t even bite a betel leaf. He was 
soft-spoken, shy, and unable to argue 
with anyone. But after Krishanthi's 
brutal murder, something inside him 
broke. Disturbed and consumed by rage, 
he joined the LTTE. Years later, I heard 
that he had become a suicide bomber. 
Such was the chain of horror this single 
crime unleashed.<br />
Death Row Confessions: The 
Architect of Annihilation Speaks
Before the Rajapaksa brothers would 
later devastate the Tamil people on 
a grander scale, it was Somaratne 
Rajapakse - not a politician, but 
an ordinary Lance Corporal of the 
Sri Lankan Army. He was the man 
who stopped Krishanthi at the army 
checkpoint on the Jaffna-Kandy 
Highway at Kaithady that day, and who, 
along with his fellow military personnel, 
raped and murdered her, then butchered 
her family.</p>
<p>Before sentencing him to capital 
punishment for his unspeakable crimes, 
the judge asked whether he had anything 
to say. Somaratne Rajapakse chose 
revelation over silence. Perhaps he felt 
remorse, or perhaps he thought: why die 
alone when men far more powerful than 
me committed even worse crimes? In 
a confession that should have shattered 
Sri Lanka's carefully constructed edifice 
of denial, he exposed the Chemmani 
killing fields and told the world of the 
blood-soaked soil where 400 to 600 
young Tamil men and women had been 
systematically abducted, murdered, and 
buried.
Rajapakse didn't merely point to 
unmarked graves - he named names. 
He identified the puppet masters behind 
this machinery of killing. He revealed 
operational details, chains of command, 
and the bureaucratic precision with 
which living human beings were 
processed into corpses and statistics.
"Almost every evening, dead bodies 
were brought there [to the Ariyalai SLA 
camp] and the soldiers were asked to 
bury them," Rajapakse testified. A friend 
of mine who lived in Ariyalai often 
recounts how they would hear painful, 
helpless cries almost every evening. A 
girl later wrote on social media how her 
mother, terrified by the sounds, would 
never step out of the house after 5 p.m. 
and never allowed her children to go 
outside. 
The Continuity of Carnage: From 
JVP to Tamil Genocide
The Chemmani killings weren't 
aberrations-they were the logical 
evolution of a system perfected during 
the late 1980s annihilation of 60,000 
Sinhala youth in the JVP insurgency. 
The same security apparatus, the same 
operational methods, the same culture 
of absolute impunity were simply 
redirected from southern Sinhala 
villages to northern Tamil communities.
Sooriyakanda mass grave, containing 
the corpses of murdered school children, 
demonstrated that the state's appetite 
for young blood transcended ethnic 
boundaries. The institutions that had 
consumed Sinhala youth were never 
dismantled-they were merely retooled</p>

for a new harvest of Tamil victims.
The Theater of Simulated Justice
Sri Lanka has mastered the 
art of "simulated transitions"-
elaborate performances that mimic 
accountability while preserving 
impunity. The Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission, the 
Paranagama Commission, and 
countless other bodies have produced 
towers of paper that serve as 
tombstones for buried truth.
These mechanisms follow a 
depressingly predictable script: 
initial promises of transparency, 
comprehensive documentation of 
atrocities, international praise for 
"progress," and eventual abandonment 
of all accountability measures. The 
performance is always the same, 
whether the victims were JVP 
supporters in the south or Tamil 
civilians in the north.
Critics might argue that these 
commissions serve important 
functions - providing platforms for 
victim testimony, creating historical 
records, and maintaining international 
engagement. This perspective 
deserves acknowledgment. Yet the 
pattern is unmistakable: decades of 
commissions have produced libraries 
of documentation but not a single high-
level prosecution. 
A Blueprint for Breaking the Cycle
The families who have spent decades 
searching for their disappeared deserve 
more than hollow condolences and 
political theater.
Today, power rests with a government 
led by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna 
(JVP). And the JVP, if anyone, 
knows what it means to lose loved 
ones to state terror. They know the 
agony of mass graves, of enforced 
disappearances, of a brutal state 
machinery that once turned its guns on 
their own youth. They know precisely 
how state machinery manufactures 
death with surgical cruelty.
Will this government - born of a 
movement that once suffered the full 
force of state violence - finally break 
the cycle? Will they deliver justice 
to the Tamil victims of Chemmani, 
whose families have waited for 
decades? Or will they, too, follow the 
same familiar script: commissions 
without consequence, reports without 
accountability, and silence without 
justice - just as every government 
before them has done?
Only time will tell. But history will 
not be forgotten. And the earth will not 
stop speaking.
