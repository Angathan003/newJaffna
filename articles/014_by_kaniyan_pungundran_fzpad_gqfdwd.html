Professor  Mahesan Nirmalan, originally from 
a humble middle-class family in Karainagar, 
has ascended to become one of the most 
internationally renowned figures in his field. 
He currently holds the prestigious title of 
Professor of Medical Education and serves as 
a Consultant in Critical Care Medicine at the 
Manchester Royal Infirmary in the United 
Kingdom. Alongside his academic chair, he 
practices as a consultant in one of the most 
demanding and high-stakes specialties—
intensive care medicine.
Professor Mahesan Nirmalan’s influence 
transcends borders. He is a distinguished 
member of the International Scientific 
Advisory Group for UK Research and 
Innovation (UKRI), the principal body 
governing research funding for the UK 
Government. His academic reach extends 
even further with Honorary Chairs in 
Intensive Care Medicine at the University of 
Cairo, Egypt, and in Post-Conflict Studies at 
the University of Gulu, Uganda. Adding to 
his global contributions, he also serves on 
the advisory board of the Centre of Digital 
Epidemiology (CODE) at the University 
of Jaffna, Sri Lanka, driving cutting-
edge advancements in public health and 
epidemiology.
These are excerpts from our exclusive 
interview with Professor Nirmalan.
Could you share with us insights 
into your early life, particularly how 
growing up in Sri Lanka, and Jaffna 
specifically, influenced your personal 
and intellectual development? How 
have these formative experiences 
shaped the person you are today?<br />
I was born into a middle-class family in 
Karainagar, Jaffna. My parents were educators 
from a traditional Hindu background, 
which meant my upbringing was steeped 
in the cultural and religious richness of 
temples, Njthuk; (Thevaaram)—sacred 
hymns dedicated to Lord Shiva, jpUthrfk; 
(Thiruvasagam)—a collection of devotional 
hymns by the poet-saint Manickavasagar, 
jpUntk;ghit (Thiruvempavai)—hymns sung 
in worship of Lord Shiva during the Tamil 
month of Margazhi, and literary classics such 
as nghd;dpapd; nry;td; (Ponniyin Selvan)—a 
historical novel by Kalki Krishnamurthy set 
in the Chola dynasty, and rptfhkpapd; rgjk; 
(Sivagamiyin Sabatham)—another historical 
novel by Kalki focusing on Pallava dynasty 
politics and intrigue. I was also exposed to 
fu;ehlf ,ir (Carnatic music), tpy;Y 
ghl;L (Villu Paatu)—a traditional form of 
storytelling accompanied by a bow-shaped 
musical instrument, and fjh gpurq;fk; 
(Katha Prasangam)—a dramatic form of 
storytelling blending narration, music, and 
performance—all of which have profoundly 
shaped me as an individual to this day.
My father, an old-school English teacher, and 
both my parents, graduates of the University of 
Peradeniya, provided a bilingual upbringing. 
At home, we predominantly conversed in 
English. When my parents were transferred to 
Bandarawela in the 1970s, I learned to read, 
write, and speak Sinhala fluently.
I was fortunate to study at some of the best 
institutions in the country, including St. 
Thomas’s Preparatory School in Bandarawela,

Jaffna Hindu College, and the Colombo 
Medical Faculty. During my time in Colombo, 
I resided in a Catholic medical hostel known as 
‘Kittiyakkara’ with around 50 Sinhala students, 
most of whom hailed from the outstations. 
I maintain close relationships with all these 
institutions and have built lifelong connections 
with people from all communities.
Growing up, I was deeply influenced by the 
novels of Jayakanthan and the poetry of 
Subramaniya Bharathy, both of which shaped 
my social conscience and political worldview. 
I personally witnessed pivotal moments in 
Sri Lanka's history: the burning of the Jaffna 
Library in 1981, the 1983 riots, and my 
subsequent return to Jaffna on a refugee cargo 
ship. I sought refuge in Nallur Temple when 
the conflict erupted between the LTTE and the 
IPKF.
I narrowly escaped death in a harrowing 
incident when the van I was traveling in was 
fired upon by a military helicopter, tragically 
resulting in the deaths of a few fellow 
passengers. I also lived through the infamous 
Pettah Bombing at the Colombo Central Bus 
Station, the massacres at Kokillai and Nai Aru, 
and the mass eviction of Muslims from the 
Jaffna Peninsula.</p>

The JVP uprising of 1988/89 and its brutal 
suppression left an indelible mark on me. 
Some of my closest friends from Kittiyakkara 
were kidnapped and killed in cold blood 
during those tumultuous times. These 
cumulative experiences have granted me a 
unique perspective on Sri Lanka’s complex 
socio-political upheavals, allowing me to view 
the ethnic conflicts and challenges through the 
lens of all its citizens.
After completing my postgraduate training 
at the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine 
in Colombo and serving as a doctor at the 
General Hospital for five years, I moved to the 
UK in 1995 to further my studies. I currently 
reside in Manchester, in the North West 
of England, where I continue to work and 
contribute to both the medical and academic 
fields.
Despite being a fulltime clinical 
academic at the University of 
Manchester, UK and a Consultant in 
a busy clinical specialty at one of the 
largest NHS Trusts in the UK, we can 
see that you are increasingly drifting 
into social activism in Sri Lanka. Why? 
And what makes you think that people 
in Sri Lanka would take your views 
seriously?<br />
Social responsibility is a key objective at the 
University of Manchester, and as a result, all 
staff are encouraged to engage in activities that 
foster positive societal impact. When the Sri 
Lankan civil war ended in 2009, I became a 
trustee of the Meththa Foundation UK (MF), 
a charity dedicated to the rehabilitation of 
amputees across Sri Lanka, including the war-
torn North and East.
I also had the privilege of applying the lessons 
we learned in Sri Lanka to Northern Uganda, a 
region similarly ravaged by prolonged conflict 
and its devastating aftermath.
These experiences instilled in me the profound 
realization that conflict prevention is not the 
responsibility of governments or organizations 
alone, but of all citizens. Reflecting on Sri 
Lanka's past, it is clear that its problems 
were perpetuated by vested interests that 
suppressed the reasonable majority within all 
communities. I now deeply regret having once 
been part of that silent majority—whether out 
of fear or self-preservation.
The University of Manchester has provided me 
with the platform to redress this silence, and I 
am committed to speaking out and articulating 
these complex issues objectively, cutting across 
ethnic divides. Whether my views are taken 
seriously or not is beyond my control—but I 
am resolved to contribute to the dialogue.
You have been a frequent visitor to 
Sri Lanka since leaving the country 
in 1995, and you have visited Jaffna 
regularly since the end of the war in 
2009. What are your thoughts on how 
society in the Jaffna peninsula has 
evolved since the war ended?<br />
I return to Sri Lanka a few times each year for 
academic and social commitments, mostly 
in Colombo. Since the war ended, I have also 
visited Jaffna frequently and engaged with 
youth from diverse backgrounds.
Over this period, I’ve observed that the 
orthodoxy, regionalism, and sectarianism that</p>

once dominated our society are rapidly fading, 
and schoolchildren are developing a keen 
interest in broader development, including 
multilingual skills and sports.
Leading schools are nurturing a new 
generation of boys and girls who are able to 
interact with their southern counterparts on 
equal footing. The state has made significant 
investments in infrastructure, resulting in 
economic transformation on a scale never seen 
before. Limited but progressive investments 
have led to changes in sporting facilities, 
cultural centers, organic agriculture, and 
tourism—positive developments overall.
However, these changes have not been 
inclusive, and many still live in abject poverty 
and marginalization. A significant number of 
war victims remain excluded from society and 
in need of active support. For example, many 
young people in the Vanni region with severe 
spinal cord injuries have had to form self-
support groups to address their medical needs, 
as wider societal support remains inadequate.
The extent of abuse of vulnerable children and 
single women is poorly understood and largely 
unaddressed. Additionally, the rapid changes 
in regional demography, proselytization under 
the guise of poverty alleviation, and the grief 
endured by families with missing loved ones 
remain serious challenges.
A growing desire for emigration among 
the youth leaves them feeling unsettled or 
dissatisfied, and cultural practices that once 
held the community together are being eroded 
by external influences such as South Indian 
films and the unchecked inflow of diaspora 
funds. This has created a stark disconnect 
between economic development and measures 
of happiness or contentment. It may explain 
the high rates of suicide, substance misuse, and 
violence.
In your interviews, you’ve expressed 
concerns about young people wanting 
to leave Sri Lanka and the serious 
implications of this trend. However, 
a skeptic might argue that it could 
be seen as hypocritical for someone 
who left Sri Lanka and thrived abroad 
to advise today’s youth against 
emigration. How would you respond to 
that perspective?<br />
Yes, it is indeed hypocritical, and I do not 
wish to pretend otherwise. However, I ask 
for understanding. We are all shaped by 
circumstances, and what happened to me 
and my ‘generation of migrants’ was part of 
a broader socio-cultural-political wave that</p>

encouraged emigration. Of course, the war 
further fueled this underlying trend within the 
Tamil community, particularly in Jaffna. The 
path to success was clear: study hard, attend 
university to pursue medicine, engineering, or 
accountancy, get married, and then emigrate. 
This was the norm, the standard by which 
success was measured.
Many great men and women returned after 
spending brief periods abroad to serve their 
communities and country, but unfortunately, I 
was not one of them. The circumstances in the 
1990s simply didn’t allow for that.
However, emigration during our time was 
limited in scale and did not threaten the 
community’s stability. Today, the situation has 
reached epidemic proportions, endangering 
the very fabric of the Tamil community. For 
example, the Jaffna Monitor issue for October 
highlighted that the number of members of 
parliament allocated to the Jaffna district 
for the upcoming general elections has been 
reduced from 7 to 6, due to the decline in 
registered voters. If current trends persist, this 
number could decrease even further in the 
next election (JM October 2024).
One of my friends told me there is now a 
shortage of people to carry the deity during 
annual temple festivals in remote towns and 
villages. Many of the islands surrounding the 
Jaffna peninsula are nearly deserted, unable to 
sustain their traditional farming and fishing 
lifestyles. These changes pose the single 
greatest threat to the stability of the Tamil 
community in Sri Lanka. This is why I believe 
it is our duty to raise awareness, especially 
among our friends and fellow countrymen in 
the diaspora.
Jaffna has a long history of migration in 
pursuit of opportunities and wealth. In the late 
19th and early 20th centuries, many migrated 
to Southeast Asia, followed by waves to the 
Middle East and Africa in the 1970s. Before 
World War II, substantial remittances were 
sent back by Jaffna migrants in Malaysia and 
Singapore. However, their descendants no 
longer maintain strong ties to Jaffna, and these 
remittances have largely dwindled. Now, a 
new generation of first-generation migrants to 
Western countries has taken their place.
In your interviews, you've highlighted 
that relying on these remittances is 
short-sighted, as future generations 
may not maintain the same connection 
to Sri Lanka. Why do you view this 
as a problem? Isn't it possible that 
a similar pattern could emerge, with 
each new generation of Tamil migrants 
sending remittances from different 
destinations?
The migration you refer to was limited in scale 
and, as mentioned before, did not destabilize 
our community. This issue cannot and must 
not be viewed solely through an economic 
lens or based on the sustainability of inward 
remittances.
Moreover, the world has changed significantly, 
and the West is now adopting a very different 
stance on immigration. Ethno-nationalism is 
on the rise across many Western countries, 
and sooner or later, restrictions will likely be 
imposed on the outward flow of resources or 
funds associated with the split loyalties often 
seen among immigrant populations.
There are no viable alternatives to developing 
the local economy so that communities and 
individuals can thrive and achieve their life 
ambitions within their own countries. You 
may have noticed the recent riots in London</p>

and several other UK cities protesting against 
mass immigration. This should serve as a clear 
warning to our people that the future of our 
community and culture lies in Sri Lanka, not 
in the West—no matter how green the other 
side may seem at present.
How do you respond to those who 
claim that the 'Tamil problem' was 
merely a 'terrorist problem' resolved 
in 2009, and that no further political 
solutions are needed for the Tamil 
community?<br />
Whether we like it or not, there is a prevailing 
view among certain sections of the Sinhala 
right that the so-called ‘Tamil problem’ is 
merely a figment of imagination, created and 
propagated by Tamil politicians for electoral 
gains. They argue that the issues affecting the 
Tamil people are no different from those faced 
by all citizens of the country, and therefore, the 
only real problem that required a solution was 
the ‘terrorist problem.’ In their view, since this 
‘terrorist problem’ was decisively resolved at 
the banks of Nandikadal in 2009, the country 
can now simply move on, focusing solely on 
economic development.
Many prominent members of this group have 
publicly claimed that there are no political 
problems unique to the Tamils that require 
a political solution. Despite being small in 
number, this group is highly influential and 
continues to shape political discourse in the 
South. The election of Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
to the presidency in 2019 is a clear indication 
of this group’s influence.
In my view, it is essential to approach the 
challenges faced by all minority communities 
objectively and articulate them in a way that 
an ordinary person can understand and 
empathize with. Genuine grievances that led 
to the armed conflict cannot simply be ‘wished 
away,’ as some might hope, as this hinders 
the country from realizing its full potential. 
Additionally, it creates opportunities for 
internal players to exploit these differences 
for electoral gains and for external forces 
to advance their own regional geopolitical 
interests.
Prolonged conflict inevitably leads to mutual 
destruction, as evidenced by current events 
in West Asia. It is the responsibility of all of 
us to ensure that we do not become trapped 
in repeated cycles of violence due to these 
unresolved grievances.
The Tamil question has been 
extensively discussed in the media, 
in Parliament, on election platforms, 
and in international forums. Given this 
background, some argue that there is 
no need or purpose in rearticulating 
these same issues. What is your 
perspective on this?</p>

Since the time I became politically aware (mid-
70s onwards), the question of ‘Tamil rights’ 
and ‘Tamil identity’ has been framed in highly 
emotive language, laden with ethno-nationalist 
undertones by all parties involved.
In my understanding, this began soon after 
independence and reached its peak during 
the period leading up to the ‘Vaddukoddai 
Resolution,’ which called for a separate state, 
and the 1977 elections that followed.
The Jayawardene government further fueled 
this divisive debate by recruiting short-
sighted politicians and pseudo-intellectuals to 
present these issues to the electorate, fostering 
paranoia and fear. For instance, textbooks such 
as Kumarodaya (Book 2) portrayed the Tamil 
people to young Sinhala children as “Tjqka yß 
kmqre ñksiaiqු” (They are very nasty people). 
In my view, the Tamil political leadership has 
consistently failed to effectively communicate 
the problems faced by the Tamil people to the 
ordinary, decent Sinhala electorate in a way 
that they could understand and empathize 
with.
The existing language barrier only 
compounded these issues, and even today, 
many ordinary Sinhalese genuinely believe 
that any attempt to solve the ‘ethnic problem’ 
through power devolution is simply an effort 
to divide the country by ‘global forces,’ acting 
under the influence of a financially powerful 
Tamil diaspora.
As long as this mindset prevails in the South, 
no solution will emerge from any government 
in Colombo. It simply cannot happen in a 
democracy. Imposing such a solution through 
external pressure is not only immoral but 
also a self-defeating exercise. In this context, 
I firmly believe that there is a need to 
rearticulate our challenges in a responsible and 
thoughtful manner—one that the ordinary 
Sinhala person can comprehend, relate to, and 
sympathize with.  The Dissanayake presidency 
provides us an opportunity to do so. 
If so, In your view, what are the 
key challenges facing minority 
communities in general, and the Tamil 
community in particular?<br />
In my view, there are three key challenges that 
specifically affect all minority communities, 
including the Tamil community:
i. Physical security:
There is a significant challenge for an average 
Tamil person, particularly one not conversant 
in Sinhala, when seeking support or assistance 
from the security forces. While this may not 
pose a major issue in daily life, it becomes a 
significant challenge in the face of organized 
political violence against the community. The 
events of 1958, 1977, 1981, and 1983 have left 
permanent scars and fears in the collective 
psyche of the Tamil community. Similarly, 
recent events like the Aluthgama and Digana 
riots have brought the question of physical 
security to the forefront for the Muslim 
community. In many of these instances, the 
security forces have been either ineffective or 
unwilling to intervene for reasons that are well 
known.
ii. Loss of cultural identity:
Cultural heritage and the identity formed 
through it are invaluable. The Tamil 
community has a legitimate fear of 
losing this identity due to the relentless 
demographic changes within the country. 
There is compelling evidence that many Tamil</p>

communities across Sri Lanka have gradually 
shed their original identities and assimilated 
into Sinhala culture. Even a casual visit to 
towns and villages along the coastal belt from 
Puttalam to Negombo bears witness to this 
transformation. While gradual assimilation 
over generations is a natural process in a 
multicultural country, the process needs to be 
organic and gradual allowing time and space 
for the changes to be embedded.
However, attempts to expedite this 
transformation through systematically 
enforced and centrally-supported land 
settlement policies set off alarm bells 
regarding the loss of identity and the so-called 
‘Sinhalisation.’ This legitimate grievance must 
be acknowledged and addressed.
iii. Belonging and ownership:
The notion that the country belongs solely to 
one community, with everyone else viewed as 
an ‘external person’ or an ‘outsider/invader,’ 
has been systematically ingrained in the 
collective psyche of the Sinhala people. A 
recent reference to ‘Landowners’ vs ‘Tenants’ 
by a prominent and controversial social 
leader encapsulates this mindset. This idea is 
deeply rooted, reinforced through literature, 
mythology, and even children's textbooks.
Recent scientific studies confirm, beyond 
reasonable doubt, that the Sinhalese and 
Tamils share a common genetic pool—they 
are, biologically and genetically, one people. 
In reality, there are no two distinct races. 
However, these findings have unfortunately 
not altered the damaging social constructs 
propagated through mythology and pseudo-
intellectualism.
These three issues encapsulate the key 
challenges faced by the Tamil and Muslim 
communities in Sri Lanka. They can be 
resolved through appropriate constitutional 
arrangements without inflaming fears or 
anxieties among ordinary citizens. What is 
needed is an honest and fair narrative from 
leadership, and once again, the Dissanayake 
presidency provides a window of opportunity. 
I hope this opportunity, emerging in the wake 
of an economic catastrophe rooted in the 
country’s disharmony, will not be wasted. 
You’ve highlighted the need for a 
conversation in Sri Lanka around end-
of-life care, with a focus on quality of</p>

life and death. But what about elderly care? In 
our society, there is an expectation that children 
will care for their aging parents. However, some 
argue that this can be impractical, particularly 
for children without access to a village-like 
support network. Should we, as a society, first 
have a conversation about the quality of elderly 
care before moving on to discussions about 
end-of-life issues?<br />
I fully agree that a conversation on elderly care is urgently 
needed. The purpose of my visit to Sri Lanka in August 
was to attend the annual scientific meeting of the Sri 
Lanka Medical Association (SLMA), which included a 
workshop on end-of-life care and 
the perception of ‘death’ across 
different cultural traditions.
However, I also acknowledge 
that a discussion on elderly care 
is equally important, especially 
given the shifts in demographics 
and lifestyle. In my view, while 
the state has an obligation to care 
for the elderly, this responsibility 
cannot and must not rest solely 
on the state. We cannot distance 
ourselves from the traditional 
belief in our country that there 
exists an unwritten covenant 
between parents and children, a 
bond that inherently demands 
sacrifice from both sides at 
different stages of life.
This covenant is deeply rooted 
in our history, culture, tradition, 
and religions. Abandoning 
it on the grounds that ‘it is 
incompatible with modern 
life’ would be detrimental on 
multiple fronts. The love and 
responsibility between parents 
and children form the bedrock 
of a compassionate society. 
While the state must intervene 
when necessary, it should not 
adopt policies that systematically 
undermine the obligations 
children have towards their aging 
parents.
In relation to these broader 
issues, what do you see 
as the strengths and 
weaknesses of medical 
education in Sri Lanka?</p>

Traditional medical education in Sri Lanka 
was heavily focused on factual knowledge. It 
placed a strong emphasis on the acquisition 
of scientific facts, with students being 
tested in great detail. As a result, students 
prioritized memorizing and mastering factual 
knowledge over more subtle, and perhaps less 
testable, skills such as empathy, attitudes, and 
performance.
However, I am aware that this is changing 
rapidly. For instance, the Colombo Medical 
Faculty now has a systematic approach to 
incorporating medical humanities into its core 
undergraduate program. I understand reliably 
that similar changes are taking place in many 
other medical faculties across the country as 
well.
Finally, what are your views on the role 
of the Tamil diaspora in Sri Lanka's 
evolving socio-economic and political 
landscape?<br />
I see the diaspora as a double-edged sword. 
On one hand, they are integral to the revival 
of our post-war society and economy. Many 
have been extremely generous in financially 
supporting their families, schools, places of 
worship, and the wider community.
The revival we see across the peninsula 
would not have been possible without the 
interventions of the diaspora. Some have 
played key roles in establishing major projects 
that generate employment and provide 
livelihood support. These investments are most 
welcome and are gratefully acknowledged by 
the communities involved.
Many past pupils' associations have made 
strategic and generous investments in their 
schools, enabling them to reach new heights in 
terms of available facilities. As a direct result, 
children from these schools are now able to 
compete nationally on an equal footing.
On the other hand, despite their material 
wealth and professional success, many in the 
diaspora yearn for their lives back ‘home’ at a 
fundamental level. A section of the diaspora 
carries deep scars and resentments stemming 
from past experiences, losses, and injustices. 
Due to language barriers, many may not fully 
understand the injustices and marginalization 
that rural Sinhala youth also faced, resulting 
in two uprisings and their brutal suppression. 
While the scale of the perceived injustices and 
structural destruction differed, the negative 
experiences across various segments of society 
had many parallels. However, there was no 
space to view these problems through the lens 
of the other side.
There was no opportunity for the 
‘Manamperies of Kataragama’ and the 
‘Isaipriyas of the Vanni’ to come together—
the politicians and pseudo-intellectuals on 
all sides ensured that. Due to these scars and 
resentments, not all interventions by segments 
of the diaspora are beneficial to the political 
discourse needed for our community and the 
country to move forward.
There is a need for the diaspora to recognize 
the changing socio-political realities on the 
ground—in the country, region, and world—
and to adjust their narratives accordingly. 
While it is important to remember history, 
it is equally important to ensure that the 
scars of the past are not passed on to future 
generations. History must serve as a guide 
to the future, not as a chain binding us 
to the collective mistakes of the past. For 
the community and the country to move 
forward, a positive outlook within the Tamil 
diaspora is essential—however difficult that 
transformation may be.</p>
