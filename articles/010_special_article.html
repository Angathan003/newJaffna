A 
belief that 
is commonly 
prevalent amongst 
sections of society – 
usually with strong ethno-
nationalistic leanings, is that a 
dominant and pure culture 
that was native to their country 
or community was influenced (or 
‘polluted’/’diluted’) by extraneous 
influences over a long period, resulting 
in a less ‘purer’ or less ‘desirable’ version 
of the original culture to rule the day. 
Attempts to identify and distil out this 
‘pure’ or ‘original’ culture then becomes the holy 
grail of these ethno-nationalistic purists and has 
formed the basis of many sectarian conflicts. 
Even the Sri-Lankan ‘ethnic’ conflict can be 
traced to the emergence of such forces - within 
the middle classes of the Sinhala and Tamil 
communities, during the late 19th through to 
the late 20th centuries. Such pursuits are usually 
futile as the reality in many countries – including 
Sri Lanka and India, is more complex than 
the simple linear narrative presented by such 
cultural purists. A study of the history of musical 
traditions provides a clear insight into this

process of confluence of diverse influences. 
When one critically observes the popular 
narratives around the history of music, one 
clearly sees attempts to sanctify certain forms 
of music as ‘indigenous’, ‘pure’ or ‘divine’ and 
downgrade the position of other musical 
traditions to that of an extraneous ‘pollutant’. 
In South India and amongst Sri Lankan Tamils 
this categorisation is usually aligned along 
social (or caste) structures (T M Krishna, A 
Southern Music: The Carnatic Story and T M 
Krishna, Sebastian &amp; Sons: A Brief History of 
Mrdangam Makers). The evolution of musical 
traditions however is one of corporation, 
cross-fertilisation and gradual evolution 
leading to new forms of music that are best 
described as the ‘joint heritage’ of all people 
living in these lands and sometimes across 
national borders. The history of nathaswaram/
thavil music in Sri Lanka – with its current 
dominant position in the cultural lives of Sri 
Lankan Tamils, is no exception. How and 
where did these instruments originate is 
therefore an interesting academic question.</p>
<p>The percussion instruments, crafted from 
domesticated animal-hide – usually goat, 
buffalo or cows, have been in widespread 
use amongst our early ancestors. Early South 
Indian and Sri Lankan literature refers to 
‘Parai’, ‘Udukkai’, ‘Bera’ and ‘Mattalam’ as some 
of the instruments that have been in use (Jim 
Sykes, The Musical Gift: Sonic generosity in 
Post-war Sri Lanka) for centuries and these

instruments most definitely predate the Thavil 
– the focus of the current series of articles. 
There is extensive reference to ‘Parai’ (giw) in 
the Sangam Literature (300 BC-300AD).  The 
‘Vedda’ (jeoaod or Ntlh;) communities – the 
aboriginal people of Sri Lanka, certainly used 
such percussion instruments and continue 
to do so to the present day (Jim Sykes, The 
Musical Gift: Sonic generosity in Post-war Sri 
Lanka). Some of these instruments – such 
as the Udukkai, have been part of the Hindu 
mythology and iconography from time 
immemorial and as such have received an aura 
of mysticism and/or divinity associated with 
them. </p>
<p>The ‘Udukkai’, ‘Parai’ (or the ‘Bera’) and 
‘Mattalam’ are popular instruments to the 
present day in the ‘Nattu-Koothu’ (ehl;L 
$j;J) or ‘Koothu’ ($j;J) performances in 
the Eastern province in Sri Lanka and beyond. 
These instruments are also commonly used 
in the Sinhala ‘Nadagam’ (or kdv.ï/ ehl;ba 
ehlfk;) performances. Different adaptations 
of these instruments are also used in temple 
functions and other ritualistic performances 
amongst the Sinhala speaking communities 
– particularly those in the Sabaragamuwa, 
coastal and Kandyan regions. There is an 
emerging consensus amongst musicologists 
that the tradition of ‘Koothu’ and folk singing 
(ehl;L ghly;) is a distinct form of music 
and dance native to this region, and predates 
Carnatic or Hindustani music – both in Sri 
Lanka and in South India, even though the 
latter came to dominate the musical discourses 
due to the dominant societal position of its 
proponents. Despite the marginalisation 
of these traditional instruments and the 
artists who performed them (attributed to 
the expansion of the Vijayanagara/Maratha 
empires into South India and the consequent 
subjugation of Tamil music and musicians), 
there are currently some clear signs that 
suggest the welcome resurgence of these art 
forms within the Tamil community. Even 
though it is hard to determine when the 
transition took place, it is likely that the grand 
‘Periya melam’ (ngupa Nksk;) or Thavil is 
likely to have evolved from these early genre 
of percussion instruments – ‘Parai’, ‘Udukkai’, 
‘Bera’ and ‘Mattalam’, that were used widely 
within nomadic musicians in South India/
Sri Lanka,. The early versions of Thavil were 
made in Tanjavur and even to this day, the 
Thavil makers of Tanjavur remain popular and 
distinctive. The Thavil is a cylindrical structure 
carved from a block of jackfruit wood. Layers 
of animal hide - usually from the buffalo and 
goat, are stretched over the two sides of the 
hollow shell using different levels of tension on 
each side. The tension may be altered further 
by adjusting the position of the hoops of hemp 
used to firmly attach the skin to the shell. The 
diameter of one side is slightly larger than the 
other and the combined differences in tension 
and diameter enables pitch blending and 
differences in the tone between the two sides. 
One side of the drum is played with a short 
stick made of hardened wood and the fingers 
covered with special ‘thimble’ like structures 
are used to play the other side of the thavil.
It is equally tempting to reflect on the possible 
evolution of Nathaswaram over time. As there 
are no written historic records, we are only 
able to speculate as to how nathaswaram may 
have evolved to its current shape and form.<br />
Wind instruments are broadly based on the 
principle of creating sounds by blowing into 
a hollow pipe(s). The sound is produced by 
blowing air directly across a sharp edge (or lip 
plate) thus creating vibrations in the column 
of air within the pipe. The flute and the piccolo 
are examples where this method is deployed. 
Alternatively, air blown in can be used to 
create vibrations of a reed (a thin piece of 
material) which then causes vibrations of the 
air column held within a cylindrical object. 
On the basis of how the sound is created, 
wind instruments may be broadly classified 
into non-reed instruments (Flute and piccolo)</p>

or reed instruments (Clarinet, saxophone, 
oboe, bassoon and the nathaswaram). The 
reed based instruments may use a single reed 
(Saxophone, clarinet etc.), double reeds (oboe, 
bassoon, nathaswaram etc.) or even quadruple 
reeds (the Thai ‘pinai’ or the Arabic ‘pii’). 
Combining this basic structural information 
of reed based wind instruments and the ethno-
social dynamics of nomadic musicians in 
India, it is possible to make some inferences 
on how the nathaswaram may have evolved 
into its current form. In this context, few 
other double reed instruments used by such 
nomadic groups in Central and South Asia 
become relevant. As no written records exist, 
any conclusions made in this respect are based 
on inferences rather than hard evidence, and 
as such, are best considered as a hypothesis 
rather than an established fact.
1. Pungi (or Mahudi – kFb): The Pungi 
is a musical instrument that originates from 
the Indian subcontinent where wind - blown 
into a hollow reservoir, is channelled into two 
cylindrical pipes, each containing a vibrating 
reed. This instrument has been used for 
centuries by snake charmers of North (Sindh 
and Rajasthan) and South India (Kerala, 
Tamil Nadu and Andra Pradesh in particular). 
Kuravars (wysl=ka;sl or Fwtu;) are an 
indigenous ethnic Tamil community whose 
roots can be traced to the Kurunji Hills. The 
Sangam literature refers to this community 
extensively with references to poets, saints and 
even gods (and goddesses) whose origins were 
traced to this community. Changing socio-
economic conditions, accelerated during the 
Vijayanagara period (14th-17th century) and 
the subsequent colonial era reduced these – 
once thriving, communities to poverty and 
a nomadic life style with snake charming 
being one of the trades commonly adopted 
by its members. The Pungi (kFb) was used 
extensively for this purpose, and may be one of 
the earliest double reed musical instrument on 
record.</p>
<p>The structure and the way it is used/held in 
performance suggests that the modern grand 
nathaswaram may have had a more humble 
beginning amongst these communities. The 
popularity of compositions such as ‘Mahudi’ 
in the raga ‘Punnagavaraali’ (Gd;dftuhsp) 
- similar to melodies played by traditional 
snake charmers, at classical nathaswaram 
concerts to this day adds some credence to 
this claim. Furthermore, until recently the 
nathaswaram concerts also included the use 
of a separate drone pipe ($j;J Foy; or 
Cik Foy;), which was used to create a 
constant sound (pitch or Sruti- RUjp) for the 
concert, thus separating out the two pipes 
that were integrated within a single shell in 
the construction of the Pungi. These indirect 
evidences do suggest that the nathaswaram 
may in fact be a derivative resulting through 
a series of modifications made to the humble 
Pungi - however weak this claim may be, when 
seen through the eyes of modern scientific 
rigor.
Figure 2: Pungi (or kFb): perhaps one of the oldest double reed instruments used within nomadic communities. Whereas one of 
the pipes was used to generate a constant drone-like sound, the other pipe – equipped with multiple holes, was used to generate 
varying tunes (Figure adapted from Wikimedia Commons, under the Creative Common License)</p>

2. Shehnai: The Shehnai is a double reed 
instrument, which resembles a nathaswaram 
both in shape and the kind of sound produced. 
Like the Nathaswaram it is made of wood with 
a flared bell shaped end and is in widespread 
use in North India. Wikipedia claims (without 
providing any direct references) that the 
Shehnai “is thought to have been developed by 
improving upon the Pungi” (or kFb). Different 
versions of Shehnai-like instruments are in 
common use in Western India, Nepal and the 
state of Karnataka. In Sri Lanka too similar 
instruments – known as ‘Horanava’ in Sinhala 
and ‘Sornali’ in Tamil, have been used along 
with percussion instruments such as ‘Bera’, 
‘Mattalam’ and ‘Parai’ in temple processions 
and in street plays (Jim Sykes, The Musical Gift: 
Sonic generosity in Post-war Sri Lanka).
The term Shehnai is derived by combining 
two words from Persia (‘shah’ – meaning 
king; and ‘nai’ or ‘ney’ – meaning a wind 
instrument like the flute). This suggests that 
this instrument may have originated in or 
around Persia and may have been used in 
royal palaces, processions or ceremonies. It 
is equally tempting to speculate that similar

musical traditions may have been introduced 
into the Indian subcontinent at some time 
point, over the very long period of historical 
connections between India and Central Asia. 
These connections range from the early Indo-
Aryan migration over 1800 years ago through 
the extensive trade links between Arabia/
Persia and India culminating in the Mughal 
invasion between the 10th-16th centuries. 
When in this very long time period did 
Persian musical instruments became part 
of the musical landscape in India is hard to 
determine and is beyond the scope of this 
article. Whenever it may have occurred, it 
found a receptive audience – already familiar 
with reed instruments such as the Pungi, who 
then may have adapted it further to suit their 
own tastes and desires. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Zurna: The Shehnai itself may have been 
derived from another similar instrument 
called the Zurna which is used across central 
and west Asia. Wikipedia comments that 
images of Zurna are visible in artwork by the 
Indo-European people living in West Asia 
during the bronze-age. It is also a double reed 
instrument usually accompanied by a bass 
drum in Armenian, Anatolian and Assyrian 
folk music. The Zurna was known in Persia 
from the 6th century and spread beyond Persia 
following the spread of Islam and the Ottoman 
Empire.
The long and conical wind instrument – 
Karna, that was made around 500BC and 
currently kept in the Persepolis museum in 
Iran broadly has many structural similarities 
to Zurna and may represent its early 
beginnings.</p>

<p>The stone Nathaswarams of South India: 
Whilst the modern nathaswarams are made 
of wood, there are two unique instruments 
that are made of granite stone. These two 
specimens are kept as unique treasures at 
the Kumbeshwarar temple in Kumbakonam

district, Tamil Nadu and at the Aathinathar 
Aalvar Temple (Mjpehju; Mo;thu; Nfhtpy;) 
in the Thoothukudi (J}j;Jf;Fb) district in 
Tamil Nadu, India. Whilst such instruments 
are rarely used for actual performances, 
their existence is important in the 
teleological understanding of the modern 
day nathaswaram. (P Saravanan, Dinamani 
22/10/2018). Both instruments are estimated 
to be several centuries old (they have not 
been formally dated by carbon dating), weigh 
almost 6 times the weight of their modern 
and longer counterparts. The instruments are 
however significantly shorter (approximately 
2 feet long) closely resembling the Shehnai 
described above (Figure 4A). These stone 
nathaswarams are less versatile than their 
wooden counterparts as they are harder to 
blow through and in general only 6 (of the 
usual 7) notes are playable in this instrument.

‘Shankarabaranam’ (rq;fuhguzk;), ‘Karaharapriya’ 
(fu`ug;upah) and Thodi (Njhb) are unplayable in 
the stone nathaswaram. (P Saravanan. Dinamani 
22/10/2018). This limited versatility may have driven 
the local artists and nadaswaram makers to start using 
hardened wood instead of stone. This attempt to place 
the stone nathaswaram as a teleological precursor of 
the wood nathaswaram is admittedly a speculation 
of the author at this stage. The definitive proof can 
only come from future research that can provide 
more accurate dating of the few remaining stone 
nathaswarams.  </p>
<p>The above sections provides the musical background, 
or the mileu within which the modern nathaswaram 
has evolved and thrived. It is hard if not impossible 
to suggest a direct linear connection between these 
different instruments. It is however clear, that 
the creativity and the ingenuity of the individual 
musicians and the desire/need to adapt their musical 
performances to suit the taste and preferences of their 
audience drove these changes. T N Rajaratnam Pillai’s 
efforts in lengthening the length of the middle portion 
of the ‘Thimri’ nathaswaram to produce the modern 
‘Bari’ nathaswaram referred to in Part 1 (Figure 
8) is the kind of creativity that have driven these 
adaptations (Jaffna Monitor, 15th December 2014). 
In this gradual transformation, both the performing 
artists and the makers of these instruments have 
played a critical role. 
To be continued in the next edition.
The stone nathaswaram of Kumbakonam: 
In size and structure this has  a close 
resemblance to the Shenhai, strongly 
suggesting a common origin or that one 
may have been derived from the other. 
For this reason, it is commonly believed 
(by several contemporary nathaswaram 
vidwans) that the nathaswaram may have 
developed through suitable adaptations 
to the shenhai (Image Adapted from The 
Hindu, 02/10/2017)
The Thimiri (shorter and higher pitched) and Bari 
(longer and lower pitched) Nathaswarams – the final step 
in the evolution of the modern day nathaswaram. This 
development was first pioneered by T N Rajaratnam Pillai, 
along with the nathaswaram maker Ranganathan Achari<br />
from Narasingapettai, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu (See 
Part 1, Jaffna Monitor 15th December 2024)

“Listen to me child… … get down … mmm 
… āah”
She kept shouting. The rice and gravy that she 
had been mixing on the plate stayed put.
Whether he was conscious of eating or not, he 
seemed to ignore his mother.
He was standing on top of the mortar. Holding 
a large handle-less sickle in his hand, he was 
swaying back and forth to the beat of his song.
Occasionally when the mortar wobbled, she 
was startled, afraid that he might topple over; 
but he kept on singing nonchalantly.
Whenever he felt like eating, he bent down 
and opened his mouth.
She was then supposed to feed him a ball of 
rice.
He would then resume his singing.
“olaiyai vettuvathum kaththithānā! intha
 overseer solluvathum puththithānā?”  <br />
Every day this ritual would last for at least 
three hours. But the mother never seemed to 
grow tired of it.
Unlike the others, the mother couldn’t accept 
him as a complete retard. She was her only 
son; darling son; a dear son without even a 
blemish in his intellect.
But he did not appear to have developed 
the intellect to comprehend the differences 
among his mother, his house, and the world. 
He trusted that when he was hungry, his 
mother would feed him. He thought about 
nothing beyond this. He had neither need nor 
compulsion to think beyond that simple want.
He had the physique of a seventeen- or 
eighteen-year-old, with an unsightly protrusion 
for a belly; but his hairless face was that of a 
ten year old.
When he was still at school, she took him to 
school every morning. Then she waited the 
whole day until three in the afternoon, when 
school ended, to take him home, carefully 
covering his head with the free end of her sāri.
But his education only lasted from 
kindergarten to fourth grade.
His brain developed to the point where he 
could look at a picture and call out “R-O-O-S-
T-E-R - Chicken!”. One day he said.
“Kandhaiyā vāththiyār    [Kandhaiyā teacher]
kindhaiyā vāththiyār  <br />
[Kindhaiyā teacher]
kaḷḷukku mēḷē   </p>
<p>[on top of a rock]
kundhaiya vāththiyār.”<br />
[squat yourself     </p>
<p>down, Teacher.]
and ran away from the school.
With that perhaps Sellamma, too, was content 
with the completion of her son’s schooling.

It was around one in the afternoon. I was 
going home for lunch.
“Here, ammā… …”
“edi Sellammā… … come over here; Can’t 
you see that the teacher is passing by… … … 
tie my vēṭṭi will you?”
It was only then I noticed him. Fresh from a 
shower, he stood tall.
His mother must have gone inside to fetch a 
vēṭṭi.</p>

“Teacher! Did the bell for the bread-break 
already ring… …?”
I nodded in agreement.
His mind didn’t mature like his body did. 
Still, he had the sense to realize that he should 
not stand naked before the teacher.
Does he not have the ability to do anything 
on his own? My mind was struggling hard 
to separate the soul of Sellamma that was 
intertwined with the body of Vayiravanāthan.
“edi… Sellamma… you devil, bring the 
vēṭṭi… Teacher is looking….”
I walked on slowly. I couldn’t dismiss him as 
a crazy person. I have seen with my own eyes 
when he acted with a rare sagacity that would 
astonish anyone. I also sensed a strange, rare 
magnetism tinged with fear that held one back 
from scolding him.</p>

Nevertheless, I felt that some 
deep flaw trumped everything 
else.

Whenever a temple festival 
came along, his excitement 
knew no bounds. On New 
Year’s Day, goddess ammaṉ 
will leave on a procession as is 
customary.
She would sit majestically on 
the red wooden horse perched 
on a wheeled cart, as the 
procession proceeded along the 
rough Nanthāvil lane.
That was a sight to behold!
By the time the deity returned 
to the temple, it would be two 
or three in the morning.
He would sit nonchalantly 
in a corner on the cart, feet 
dangling, holding up an oil 
torch.
One can envision the scene: an 
old silk vēṭṭi wrapped around 
his hip, held tightly in place 
by a red piece of cloth, his 
bare body generously dabbed 
with sandalwood paste, and his 
mouth frequently barking out 
commands.
As the cart stumbled over 
potholes, causing alarm among 
onlookers who feared that he 
might topple over, he would 
casually use his hip cloth to 
wipe the oil dripping down to 
his elbow, and order people around without a care in the 
world: “Ah… Rathiṉaṇṇai… … pour me some more oil.”
He would await the dawn with a frightening display of 
patience without catching even a wink.
When one saw him in this situation, one wondered if he 
didn’t even have the awareness to be scared.
Not just temple festivals, he would show up uninvited to any 
wedding or funeral, too.
Someone would say “Vayiravanathā… arrange these betel 
leaves on the platter”. Without fatigue or displeasure, he 
would sit cross-legged and patiently arrange thousands</p>

of betel leaves on platters. It 
would never occur to him to 
display any sign of discontent.
I would regard him in awe.

They had closed the school after 
midday for the chariot festival 
at the Mañjavaṉappathi temple. 
People thronged from near and 
far to see the giant chariot that 
was the pride of Kokuvil.
It was scorching, around two 
in the afternoon. As usual, 
the chariot had come to a halt 
amidst the multitudes of people, 
in the corner of the northern 
path around the temple.
I straightened my back to regard 
the chariot. It stood tall, like 
a giant motionless mountain, 
among the suffocating flood 
of tiny people. It had arrived 
there at ten in the morning but 
thereafter had refused to budge 
even an inch. The more people 
tried to pull the rope to cajole 
it to move, the more its wheels 
sank into the ground.
People milled around the 
chariot.
No one had any strength left in 
their bodies nor in their hearts.
Everyone was fasting for the 
festival, so hunger was gnawing 
at them.
“Arōkarā!”
“To Mañjavaṉappathi Murukaṉ!”
“Arōkarā!”
As the countless people cheered on, the chariot would 
tantalize by appearing to budge a tiny bit, its brass bells 
jingling. It felt as if Murukaṉ was laughing aloud at us …
But the chariot did not budge.
All efforts were futile.</p>
<p><img alt="p079_i1.jpg" src="assets/images/010_special_article/p079_i1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com

People started to whisper, “did someone 
commit some grave sin to anger God?”
Others pleaded at Murukaṉ’s feet, calling out 
his name.
Only then did I notice him. Amidst the 
thousands of jaded, exhausted people he stood 
apart, radiating a rare enthusiasm without any 
sign of tiredness.
That same old vēṭṭi, and the red cloth tied 
around it, and a chest daubed with sandalwood 
paste.
“Arōkarā…. Mmm…  To Mañjavaṉappathi 
Murukaṉ..”
“Arōkarā”
“Mmmm… Kandhaiyā aṇṇai… give me a 
hand … Arōkarā.”
He was pacing up and down, cheering people 
on. When everyone else was downcast, having 
lost all hope, he was still smiling.
Is he not tired? Does he not comprehend that a 
difficult job is indeed difficult?
The sun had started its descent. Whatever little 
hope that remained had started to fade.
One by one, people dropped the chariot rope 
and sat on their haunches.
No one had any ideas on how to remedy the 
situation. The chariot needs to reach its hangar.
Someone would touch the chariot rope, only 
to drop it the next moment, and go back to 
squatting.
Old Kathirkāmathāchchi who was carrying 
a pot of burning camphor, went into a trance 
and squealed, “Murukaṉ demands a sacrifice, 
Murukaṉ demands a sacrifice.”
I glanced down. There were already three 
pumpkins smeared with vermilion powder and 
cut in half.
“Perhaps if someone fetches a tractor from 
Iṇuvil … … we can haul the chariot …”
“What!”
The very thought struck everyone as 
disgusting and disgraceful.
How could one even contemplate getting a 
tractor to drag Murukaṉ’s chariot, which ought 
to be dragged by an outpouring of devotion?
“Kandhaiyā aṇṇai you take the wheel chock 
away, let’s give it one more try.”
“You madman… stand aside.”
Kandhaiyā aṇṇai felt a surge of anger.
“You are trying to teach me, are you?”
I examined Vayiravanāthan’s face closely. 
There was no sign of hatred whatsoever. It was 
as if he didn’t even hear Kandhaiyā aṇṇai’s 
harsh words.
He stood there wearing the same enthusiasm 
and smile.
People jostled to get a handhold on the chariot 
rope.
“Arōkarā”
“Teacher… … mmm… … give us a hand.”</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com

It was said with a charm that precluded any 
possibility of disagreement. I wrapped my 
sālvai around my waist and obeyed him.
“Arōkarā”
Eyes closed on their own. All of us focussed 
our hearts and expended every last ounce of 
energy to pull the chariot.
“To Murukaṉ”
“Arōkarā”
“To Mañjavaṉappathi Murukaṉ”
“Arōkarā”
The chariot relented and sped forward with 
sudden enthusiasm. At that moment, no one 
knew where we were heading.
Suddenly, something happened …
Everyone dropped the chariot rope and 
sprinted in the opposite direction.
I did, too.
In the hot sand, he lay on his stomach in a pool 
of blood, bleeding from his mouth and nose. 
His right hand tightly clutched the sand.
When I crawled into the melee and looked 
over the heads of people with great difficulty, 
his left leg and arm were palpitating.
Thereafter he lay motionless.
4
I walk with my eyes fixated firmly on the 
tarred road surface.
People bustle this way and that.
“It seems the chariot has reached its hangar.”
My head, on its own, nods in agreement!
– Everything that begins a journey must reach 
its hangar, after all.
– But is reaching the hangar the important 
thing? How one reaches the destination is 
indeed important, is it not?
Kathirkamathāchchi’s deranged look flashes 
into my mind’s eye.
My mind weighs heavily.
– Teacher, why do you stand there staring. 
Give us a hand.
He stands there smiling. On his face, that same 
charm blended with fear. A charm that makes 
it impossible to decline the request.
“Teacher, who is it that died?”
I open my mouth to reply.
But my words stay pent up within my chest.
Someone behind me responds.
“It was some mad boy.”
I keep walking, lifting my vēṭṭi slightly to 
avoid tripping over it.
The gravel beneath my bare feet rekindles my 
pain.</p>
