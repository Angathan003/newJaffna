n Jaffna, a distressing event has 
spotlighted the grave perils associated 
with unauthenticated and unsanctioned 
medical practices. Manikkam Sargunaraja, 
a 64-year-old inhabitant of Achchuvei 
Vallalay East, succumbed to an infection 
that developed subsequent to receiving 
acupuncture treatment.
In Jaffna, Unregulated 
Acupuncture Culminates 
in Tragic Fatality

Sargunaraja, persuaded by an advertisement 
on Facebook, sought treatment at an 
acupuncture facility located on the brown 
road in Jaffna. This procedure, which entailed 
the insertion of needles into his knees, led to 
severe swelling and acute pain in his lower 
extremities, necessitating his admission to the 
Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Despite two weeks 
of intensive medical care, his life could not be 
saved.
Post-mortem analysis revealed that the 
infection was directly attributed to the 
acupuncture needles, thus shedding light 
on a significant oversight in the oversight of 
alternative medical practices in Sri Lanka. 
Notably, acupuncture practitioners in the 
area are not mandated to register, while 
professionals who are registered with the Sri 
Lanka Medical Council are prohibited from 
advertising on Facebook and similar platforms.
This harrowing incident underscores the 
hazards of unregulated medical practices in 
Sri Lanka's northern region. The escalation 
of unlicensed practitioners and misleading 
advertisements in the Jaffna vicinity raises 
serious concerns. Nevertheless, there seems to 
be an absence of firm intervention from the 
Northern Provincial Health Department and 
local law enforcement agencies in tackling 
these hazardous practices.
The tragedy poignantly illustrates the lethal 
risks associated with medical treatments 
administered by unverified sources. It strongly 
calls for heightened regulatory oversight and 
comprehensive public awareness campaigns 
to ensure health and safety in the face of non-
traditional medical practices.</p>

A voice sang out rhythmically in the distance:
kaṇṇādē karaiyāre kākkaṇavam pūchchiyārē, 
muṉṉūṟu muḻaṅgālaith thaṭṭikkoṇdu
va… … raṭ … … ṭō!
The others responded aloud: kūū kūū.
Sṟi’s body shivered. He, too, called out: kūū. 
But his voice was faint. The kids scattered 
crisscrossing the play area.
Sṟi clasped his hands, pressed his thumb 
on the ground to lift himself up and looked 
around.
There was no one around.
He was alarmed.
He, too, needed to hide quickly.
A cold shiver ran down his spine. He jumped 
down softly and opened his eyes wide to look 
around. There was no one around to help him.
Sṟi ran.
He ran, looking back from time to time.
He was panting. He raised his head and 
looked above.
Overhead, he saw bunches and bunches of 
ripe fruit on the black plum tree.
He doesn’t eat black plums. They make your 
teeth rot. That is how Raviyaṉ got a rotten 
tooth.
Sṟi’s mother was the one who had explained 
this to Sṟi.
He bent down to go through the poṭṭu, the 
whole in the fence intended as a quick 
shortcut. When he bent down, he felt his shirt 
tighten. It was a suspender shirt.
He was irritated.
He rubbed his eye with the back of his hand.
It was itching.
− kat kadaa, kat kadaa kat kadaa.
Saras akkā was at her sewing machine. When 
she sews, she keeps her head down. She didn’t 
see him.
His heart pounded.
He leaned his elbows on the sewing machine’s 
outstretched tray, supported his chin and 
peered intently at Saras akkā.
He could see the remnants of the talcum 
powder still intact on her neck. That was 
Cuticura powder. He loved its smell.
His mother always put the talcum powder can 
somewhere high, out of his reach. He longed 
to dab himself with copious amounts of 
talcum powder.
Saras akkā stopped sewing and smiled at him.
He said:
— Saras akkā, Sarasakkā , show me a place to 
hide.
Saras akkā rubbed his head gently and told 
him to hide under the sewing machine.
They will never find him here. Even if they 
come looking for him, he should be absolutely 
quiet. Even if he felt like coughing, he should 
suppress the urge …
He watched Saras akkā‘s legs move 
rhythmically. Whenever the dressing gown 
parted slightly, he could see her feet. They 
were sparkling white.</p>

They asked:
— Saras akkā, did Sṟi come this way?
She responded:
— Nope, he didn’t come this way.
Overjoyed, Sṟi wrapped his arms around her 
legs. Her legs stopped moving.
She bent down and picked him up.
One of her arms was full of red bangles and 
the other, full of black ones.
Her arms were soft to the touch.
He was tempted to touch her pale palms.
When a pale palm is caned, blue welts appear.
Whenever the teacher raised a hand to cane 
him, he would involuntarily shiver.</p>
<p><img alt="p046_i1.jpg" src="assets/images/018_in_jaffna_unregulated_acupuncture_culminates_in_tr/p046_i1.jpg" /></p>

But he wasn’t permitted to withdraw his palm 
when the cane was in midflight. Once the cane 
landed, he was supposed to wipe that palm on 
his trousers and offer the other palm.
The teacher would always adjust his glasses 
and fix him with a piercing gaze.
But the teacher never caught him eating 
chocolate. He always gave half the chocolate 
to Raviyaṉ, wrapping the piece of chocolate 
in his shirt before biting it into two pieces. 
That would keep his saliva from getting onto 
the chocolate.
He would write letters to his father:
— I want a color pencil, two boxes of 
chocolates, a color pencil with a picture of a 
dog, and nothing else.
His father comes on Yārḻdēvi. He had never 
seen it firsthand because Yārḻdēvi comes in 
the middle of the night.
When he awoke, he would realize that his 
mother had carried him over and put him 
down to sleep by himself.
He was afraid to sleep alone. He knows that 
ghosts don’t exist. His teacher had said so.
But sometimes the shade of the Indian coral 
tree would sway like a ghost. But it was just a 
shadow.
At night, there was only the sound of the 
clock ticking:
—tak tik, tak tik, tak tik.
In the darkness, only the two hands of the 
clock would be visible. One long and the 
other short. They would both be shimmering.
Mahēn knows how to tell time from a clock, 
but Sṟi couldn’t yet. He would, when he got to 
third grade.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ammā would buy bread when the bread 
vendor came by. Sṟi would go to stand next 
to her. He would touch the bread and feel its 
warmth. He loved that fresh bread smell. He 
was the one tasked with delivering bread for 
Saras akkā’s house.
Ammā would say:
— Go take this to Saras akkā’s house.
And she would yell after him:
— Just give it and return quickly without 
hanging around there.
But he would never return quickly. He was 
really fond of Saras akkā. Her face was round.
She would be wearing a black poṭṭu on her 
forehead. A big poṭṭu.
Ammā puts black poṭṭu on him, too. To keep 
him from moving his cheeks, she would press 
them tightly with her fingers. It would hurt 
him.
When you sharpen a pencil, you can check If 
it is sharp enough by puffing your cheek and 
poking it with the sharpened pencil.
Hard pencils are the best. Soft pencils tend to 
break.
His father bought him hard pencils for exams. 
Sṟi would always write with hard pencils.
He hoisted the bread above his head and ran, 
with a skip in his steps. The suspender on 
his shirt slipped down from his shoulders. 
He adjusted it back into place. But it slipped 
down again.
He ran, calling out to Saras akkā.</p>

He bent down to go through the poṭṭu, putting 
one hand on the ground to support him. He 
called out.
— Saras akkā!
He shouted again.
— Hold that dog!
Gravel pricked his knee.
Red caterpillars are beautiful. He was tempted 
to pick one up and play with it. But he must 
not. It is the spit of Lord Siva. His weaving 
teacher had said so.
— Rath-thi- nēs-vari.
— Raththinēsvari.
Raththinesvari akkā interrogated him:
— What’s your name?
He replied:
— Sṟi.
She looked at him in fascination and asked 
again:
—Where do you live?
He replied:
—On the front porch.
They all laughed out loud, including 
Raththinesvari akkā.
Sṟi tried to laugh with them, too. But he felt 
like crying instead.
— Why did they laugh?
Ravi squeaked in a high-pitched voice.
—Kokuvil.
None of them laughed now.
Why?
Saras akkā took hold of the dog’s leash and 
called out to him. He stood up and dusted the 
dirt off his knees.
Saras akkā would help him with schoolwork. 
He would be mesmerized looking at her 
moving lips. Her eyes were refreshing like 
freshly peeled rambutāns.
His hair was cropped short, in the “police” 
style. She would gently rap his head with her 
knuckles, but only when he gets a sum wrong 
in math.
They would sing —
moṭṭaip pāppā,        <br />
[bald baby,]
caṭṭi udaippāṉ. </p>
<p>[will break the pot.]
mūṇdu pāṉai     </p>
<p>[Three jugs of]
kūḻ kudippān.   </p>
<p>[kūḻ will he drink.]
He can drink ninety jack leaves full of kūḻ. 
His elder brother can drink a thousand, His 
father even more.
Saras akkā would ask again:
— If you take away nine from twenty two, 
how much is left?
A weary sleepiness would engulf him.
He would try to count on his fingers. Even if 
he would add his toes, he wouldn’t be able to 
get to twenty two.</p>

He would look at her, smile gently and would 
blow out the oil lamp.
The flame will die silently. Saras akkā would 
bend down to kiss him.
He would cover his face; shyness would 
overcome him. One could kiss his sister 
because she was still in kindergarten. But he 
was already in second grade. No one should 
kiss him. Nevertheless, he liked Saras akkā. 
But he didn’t like Kārthigēsu master, who 
often visited akkā. She was going to marry 
him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Saras akkā used to be very shy. She would 
scamper away to hide whenever someone 
showed up. After the engagement, one is 
allowed to talk to her betrothed. Although he 
was a big boy, he had planned to wed Saras 
akkā.
But that was all before, not anymore.</p>

Akkā loved black plums. He would pick out 
the choicest ones for her. But he would be too 
shy to go inside.
Kārthigēsu master was tall and dark. Akkā 
would be chatting with him.
Sṟi would stand at the entrance, hiding the 
black plums behind his back. He would peek 
through the gap in the door. Akkā would 
beckon him to come inside. She would take 
just one plum.
—This is enough for me Sṟi, you eat the rest.
She wouldn’t lift him to sit on her lap or pinch 
him playfully on his cheek.
He would be on the verge of tears.
He would throw away the black plums right 
by their veranda.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was akkā who took his measurements for 
the new shirt. It would be a suspender shirt. 
He would wear it for akkā’s wedding. It would 
have lots of red buttons.
She pinched his eyelid. Sṟi lifted his face to 
look at her quizzically.
She called out over the fence to his mother.
She said:
—Just come take a look at Sṟi; his whole body 
feels a little odd.
Ammā removed his shirt and gently stroked 
his back. Her face darkened.
Sṟi felt weary. Ammā carried him over to the 
mat. Old sarees were draped over the mat. He 
tucked his legs in and felt the warmth of the 
bedding.
He wanted to turn towards the other side. But 
his whole body was aching. Ammā told him to 
stay put and not exert.
If he stayed like this his illness would go 
away. He could then go to Sarasakkā’s 
wedding. He would wear his new suspender 
shirt.
Saras akkā would have come by for fitting 
his shirt … … but now only ammā was 
allowed to come near him. She would blow 
everywhere on his body where he felt the 
burning sensation. That felt divine.
A bunch of neem leaves would be stuck onto a 
roof rafter. Ammā would have put it there. He 
would fix his stare on it. It would look as if it 
was very very close. But when he held out his 
hand, it would retreat beyond his reach, far far 
away.
One mile, two miles, ten miles, a thousand 
miles, a billion million miles.
He would only eat porridge. He would slurp it 
from his saucer. His saucer was green. Aṇṇai’s 
was red, its edge chipped. His sister’s was 
also green, but it had a white line on it.
If his sister took his saucer, he would pick a 
fight with her.
She would grab all the trinkets from the 
maṇavaṟai, the decorated ceremonial porch 
under which Tamil weddings take place, 
collecting more than him; he, too, would 
collect, secretly, without her knowledge.
Akkā would go to sit in the maṇavaṟai. She 
would be wearing a saree like a grown-up 
woman. But in fact, she was still a girl.
Kārthigēsu master would sit next to her. Tall, 
bespectacled, stylish. Sṟi was irritated by him.</p>

The wedding car would be decorated 
exquisitely. It would be decked with green, 
blue, and red lamps. He would climb onto the 
wedding car, too. Akkā would sit very close to 
Kārtigēsu master, almost touching him.
He wanted to run to Saras akkā. Although 
there were lots of people there, Saras akkā 
would pick him up and sit him on her lap. He 
would be very shy, extricating himself from 
her and running away.
He would run to Saras akkā when Ammā was 
not looking. But he was afraid. He was not 
supposed to get wet. Ammā would smack him 
if she found out he was wet.</p>
<hr />
<p>He turned over on the mat. It didn’t hurt at all. 
But Ammā wouldn’t let him get up. She kept 
saying that he would get better the next day, 
or the day after.
It was all lies. He could even hear the 
sound of wedding drums; he could hear the 
electricity generators.
It made him furious. He couldn’t see any of 
the festivities. He couldn’t even get to try on</p>

his new shirt.
Ammā would take him to the temple for a 
convalescence bath. After that he can eat fish 
curry or get wet while playing.
He sat up. There were flies buzzing around 
him. He stared at them intently.
Bzzzzzzzz.
Sṟi tried shooing them away with his little 
hands. But they kept coming back.
He was tired. He would run away to akkā’s 
house when ammā wasn’t looking. He would 
climb onto akkā’s lap. She would be biting her 
golden neck chain. Sṟi would grab it with two 
fingers.
The bread vendor’s bell rang out. A dog ran 
away barking.
His chest pounded. He peeked through the 
window. Ammā was in the yard breaking 
leaves for the livestock.
Sṟi whispered:
—One pound.
It was awkward to put his feet on the ground 
after such a long time in quarantine. He 
grabbed the bread loaf in one hand and ran, 
turning his head from time to time to look 
behind him.
At a distance, ammā dropped the kokkaththadi 
and sprinted after him.
She screamed:
Dey Sṟi!
She called out again.
Don’t run through the puddle, come here!
He took no notice and kept running, panting 
heavily.
He leaned one hand on the ground and bent 
himself through the poṭṭu.
He felt a sharp pang on his bare back.
Ammā was standing behind him with a switch 
that she had torn off. She had just barely 
grazed him gently. But he felt like he was 
dying.
His sobs bubbled forth from within.
The dog sniffed the bread loaf on the ground 
and ran back home.</p>
<hr />
<p>He sobbed. His lean back heaved up and 
down with each sob. It burnt as if it was on 
fire.
He cried bitterly. He was definitely going 
to complain to his father when he returned 
home.
He could smell the porridge and knew it 
would be delicious. But he resolved not to 
want it. If ammā comes in he would roll over 
onto his stomach and turn his face away.
His sobs were subsiding. Soon they would 
stop.
He heard his mother banging the kitchen 
door shut. Once again, the sobs came forth 
uncontrollably.
He heard the staccato sound that her saree 
made as she walked.
No, he would not turn his face.</p>
