uring his later years, Sir Pon Ramanathan 
became deeply involved in Shaiva 
religious activities. He began to use the 
name 'Sri Parananda.' Despite engaging in 
meditation, religious teachings, and building 
and reforming Shaiva temples, he did not 
stop his research, explorations, and writing. 
Under the name Sri Parananda Yogi, he taught 
yoga and meditation. One of the people who 
learned yoga from him was Allan Bennett.1
1 In 1900, Sir Henry Allan Bennett (1872-1923) 
traveled to East Asia to treat asthma. Upon arriving 
in Sri Lanka, he developed an interest in Buddhism. 
He had worked under Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan 
and learned about yoga and meditation. Bennett later 
shared these learnings with his friend Aleister Crow-
ley. Crowley subsequently gained fame as a magician. 
Ananda Coomaraswamy, Sir Ponnambalam Ramana-
than's brother-in-law, was involved in a well-known 
divorce from his wife, Ratan Devi. Bennett eventually 
In 1898, he published a 342-page book titled 
'An Eastern Exposition of the Gospel of 
Jesus According to St. Matthew,' and in 1902, 
another 332-page book titled 'An Eastern 
Exposition of the Gospel of Jesus According 
to St. John.' These two books are considered 
the first comprehensive commentaries on the 
became a Buddhist monk, adopting the name Ananda 
Metteyya. As the first Briton to do so, he is considered 
a pioneer in bringing Theravada Buddhism to Eng-
land.

Bible to be published in an Asian country.2 In 
addition to these, he submitted several other 
works on the Bible to an American university.3 
Although some of these were prepared for 
publication, they were never released.4 The 
extent to which university scholars in America 
celebrated these two books during his visit 
to the United States is documented in the 
biography of Sir Pon Ramanathan, compiled 
by M. Vaithilingam.
He did not publish these two English books 
on Christianity under his own name but 
under the name 'Sri Parananda.' The publisher, 
KEGAN PAUL, TRENCH, TRUBNER &amp; 
CO. Ltd., based in London, released the 
books. These works have not been translated 
into Tamil.5 Both books were edited by R.L.

5 She arrived in Sri Lanka from Australia seeking 
spiritual enlightenment. Subsequently, she became 
Ramanathan's private secretary. Following the death of 
his first wife, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan married 
Ms. Harrison, who later adopted the name Leelavathi. 
Harrison. The cover of the book on Matthew 
bears the inscription, 'From the Light of the 
Experience of God by Sri Parananda.' He used 
the name Parananda only as a pseudonym for 
these books and was not known as Parananda 
Yogi by anyone. Why did he use this name 
only for his Christian exegesis? Even when he 
translated and published the Hindu scripture 
Bhagavad Gita in 1914, he used his real name. 
These mysteries remain to be unravelled.
Ramanathan's Letter
I recently searched for and obtained the digital 
version of these two books. It is clear that 
the book belonged to Ramanathan. Inside 
is a handwritten letter by him addressed 
to Mr. Bridge. The letter, dated 02.09.1906 
and addressed to the librarian at Cornell 
University, mentions that he has sent three 
of his research works for the university's 
approval. He also notes that he will be 
departing from New York to London on 
the 6th, providing a London address for 
correspondence.
As president of the Saiva Mangaiyar Sabha, founded by 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Leelavathi Ammaiyar 
engaged in significant public service. In recognition 
of his literary contributions, the University of Ceylon 
awarded Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan an honorary 
Doctor of Laws degree.</p>

At the end of the letter, he added a postscript 
(P.S.) stating, 'My full name is Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan,' suggesting that he sent this 
book to a new acquaintance unfamiliar with 
him. This could explain why he signed his 
name as 'P. Ramanathan' in English under the 
printed name 'Sri Parananda' on the book's 
cover.
Later, I found additional references to this 
in M. Vaithilingam's book. It mentions that 
during his visit to America, Ramanathan 
participated in the inaugural events of the 
U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C. While 
there, he discovered collections of his legal 
writings in a library. The librarian expressed 
a desire to obtain copies of his other books 
as well, and Ramanathan promised to send 
them upon his return to Sri Lanka. However, 
for this article, it was found that the book 
with Ramanathan's handwritten note had 
indeed been sent to Cornell University. It 
is possible that he might have sent copies 
separately to Congress as well.</p>

I downloaded both of these books for this 
article from the website https://archive.
org. When I searched for who had uploaded 
these books, I discovered that it was the 
Cornell University Library. Among the over 
76,000 books uploaded by this university 
on the Archive website, 77 are related to Sri 
Lanka, including the legal books compiled by 
Ramanathan.
The Parananda Secret
The content of these two books is essential 
for study in Tamil because Ramanathan's 
extensive research goes beyond biblical studies. 
It is clear that he analyzed these topics through 
the lens of the Saiva Siddhanta traditions he 
had learned. Ignoring these books would be 
a significant oversight for anyone attempting 
to study Ramanathan's Tamil-Saiva-Vellalar 
identity.
His writings on Christian topics may have 
been influenced by Navalar, who played a 
pioneering role in introducing him to politics. 
We are already aware of Navalar's involvement 
in translating the Bible into Tamil.
In the aforementioned book on "St. John," 
Ramanathan also mentions a publication 
titled "Mystery of Godliness," which he wrote 
in 1895.6 The last page of this book lists the 
addresses of sales agents in the United States, 
Australia, India, and Sri Lanka.
Moreover, the preface to this book was not 
written by Ramanathan, who used the name 
Sri Parananda. Instead, it was written by his 
wife, Mrs. Harrison, who compiled the book. 
The preface is dated 'Good Friday, 1902,' 
and spans five pages. It's noteworthy that the 
preface for the earlier mentioned book on St. 
Matthew, published four years earlier, was also 
written by Mrs. Harrison, but it was a brief six-
line paragraph on a single page.
It is both surprising and intriguing why Sri 
Parananda, or Ramanathan, did not write the 
prefaces for these two books. Apart from the 
cover, his name does not appear anywhere 
inside the books.
Ramanathan authored and compiled numerous 
books, most of which were primarily written 
for English readers. However, there are still 
some lingering scholarly doubts about whether 
all these works were indeed written by him.

I recall historian and professor Raghupathi 
mentioning, in response to one of my 
comments, that some of the books attributed 
to Sir Pon Ramanathan were not actually 
written by him. This is a point worth noting, 
and I have often wondered 
if this information could be 
true.
When exploring the origins 
of the name 'Parananda,' 
it becomes evident that 
Ramanathan's spiritual 
teacher was Sri La Sri Arul 
Parananda Desikar (also 
known as Arulparananda 
Swamigal). Both Ramanathan 
and his brother Arunachalam 
studied religion, philosophy, 
meditation, and yoga under 
Arul Parananda Desikar. 
Sir Pon Ramanathan's spiritual mentor, 
Arul Parananda Swamigal, was a Brahmin 
from Thanjavur. It was after meeting Arul 
Parananda that Ramanathan began to immerse 
himself deeply in Saiva Siddhanta and spiritual 
matters, shifting away from his earlier focus on 
politics and social issues.7 Parananda Desikar 
was the spiritual guru to both Ramanathan 
and his brother.8
In 1930, S. Ponnambala Pillai wrote a historical 
account of Ramanathan titled 'Sri Ramanatha 
Maniyam' in poetic form, consisting of over 
a thousand verses. This work was written and 
published shortly after Ramanathan's death 
in the same year. The book also includes 
a photograph of Arul Parananda Desikar. 
Additionally, in the 331st verse of the book, S. 
Ponnambala Pillai did not forget to record the

sity press – 2018 – P-67,68

Society, 1971
contributions of Arul Parananda Desikar.
Sivakamisundari, Ramanathan's daughter, 
married Subbiah Nadesan, the grandson of 
Arul Parananda Desikar.
Ramanathan received his 
early education at Royal 
College, Colombo, under the 
guidance of Dr. Boake. He 
pursued further studies in 
Chennai under the mentorship 
of Dr. Thompson and C.V. 
Thamotharampillai. He studied 
law under Sir Richard Morgan 
and learned the intricacies of 
politics from his father-in-law, 
Sir Muthu Coomaraswamy. 
Additionally, he gained 
knowledge of spiritual 
matters from Arul Parananda 
Swamigal.9
The Bhagavad Gita, translated from Sanskrit 
by Sir Pon Ramanathan (referred to as 'P. 
Ramanatha Thurai'), was published in 1914 
at the Jaffna-Navalar Press. This rare and 
significant book features a preface written in 
Sanskrit by Srimath M. Sarveswara Sarma, 
which is quite remarkable. On one hand, 
Ramanathan had conflicts with Muslims, and 
on the other, he promoted Saiva activities, 
building Saiva schools and temples while 
also upholding Sanskrit. While he was deeply 
involved in Saiva religious writings, he also 
engaged in Christian studies.
To fully understand the Vaishnava background 
behind his Tamil-Jaffna-Saiva-Vellalar-
educated-upper-class-patriarchal politics, it 
is essential to also understand Sri Parananda 
Yogi.

he ceiling fans are spinning fast. Their shadows from 
the yellow light of the electric bulbs move like dark 
monsters. In that hauntingly beautiful setting, I stare past 
the closed glass window, transcending the chatter of my 
co-workers, losing myself in the feeling that a nameless 
emotion was rising up from the depths of my heart as a 
bewitchingly charming silent ballad.

Beyond the snaking road, one can see the 
uneven silhouette of tiled roofs. The tower 
of the Pillaiyār temple and the cross on St. 
Mary’s church stand in attention next to each 
other in the northeast corner as if they were 
delivering a philosophical sermon. Further 
away, those three flags on the harbor flagpole 
flutter in the wind. The green leaves on the 
lone coconut tree towering above the tiled 
roofs sway in the wind. The flag poles on 
the ships in the harbor peek above the tiled 
rooftops.
The silent ballad titillates my heart. Like 
when one hears the rare sound of the violin 
in musical concerts that melts the heart, like 
all the musical energy entwined together 
into a lament, like a pure innocent damsel 
whimpering in a soft voice…
I keep looking outside.
A bevy of clouds envelop the earth into 
semi darkness. A light drizzle persists. At a 
distance, a movie theater’s name glitters in its</p>

red light.  A middle-aged woman in a red sari, 
drawn up to cover her head, hurries along the 
road that curves out of sight.
I close my eyes to look within. My heart 
yearns for something. As if I am weary of 
this mundane existence, as if I am overcome 
with an urge to renounce this worldly life, as 
if I am being told to accept it with a smile if 
I suddenly encountered death… as if green, 
red, blue, and yellow hues swirl into one,... as 
if there is some connection between the silent 
ballad and the swirling hues, as if the silent 
ballad turns into a shade of yellow… aiyō! I 
open my eyes.
The world lies sprawled beyond the window 
with its exquisite beauty. A drizzle is falling 
on the world half-immersed in darkness. The 
world outside resembles the description of the 
setting in the biography of the scientist Louis 
Pasteur, when he first left home for college 
on a coach. He held fast to his ideals and left, 
even as nature wept. He became a scientist. 
But I …?
Am I weeping with nature?
Do suffering souls weep? Then, is the world 
immersed in suffering? Am I suffering? If 
so, is suffering charming? Is it bewitching? 
Will it lead to an indescribable yearning? 
Finally, finally … will it lead to peace and 
joy? If nature weeps, will the world thrive 
afterwards?</p>

Suddenly there is lightning; The world shines 
brilliantly and then darkens; Darkness; light; 
suffering – bliss; storm – calm; green – red — 
blue – yellow; One is not without the other. 
Does one depend on the other?
I weep; I laugh; I suffer; I rejoice.
Life! Darkness; light; suffering; joy.
The bell from St. Mary’s church rings, ripping 
open the silence of silences. The sound 
pervades everywhere, buzzing. Buzzing, 
buzzing, buzzing… as if the sound sweetens 
my ears.
I hear the silent ballad blending with a 
wondrous melody. My eyes moisten. Just like 
the sadness resulting from the seaside ballads 
rendered by Kōvalaṉ and Kaṇṇaki in the 
Tamil epic cilappatikāram, for me… for me

I closed my eyes again.</p>

With a showy gait, swinging her arms that 
say, ‘I am fearless, no matter what happens,’ 
she arrives and smiles. Once upon a time, 
she entered my life’s journey and took a 
permanent place in it. There is surely some 
connection between her, the yellow hue, and 
the silent ballad.
It was a day just like this …
On a quiet, beautiful, drizzly day overcast 
with heart-wrenching clouds, I took refuge 
from the drizzle under the roofed porch 
in front of the Theatre of the Arts at the 
university and waited for my bus. She, 
too, was waiting. She stood like a statue 
wearing a yellow sari, her golden yellow skin 
shimmering. Her yellow form shone like a 
flame in my eyes. She stood murmuring a 
sad song, like a creeper leaning against its 
support.
Seconds dissolved. Minutes dissolved. Hours 
were born. Eyes met.
The bus arrived; we both boarded the bus. She 
climbed on board after me.
I bought tickets for both of us. She smiled and 
softly said “thank you.” I responded, “You are 
welcome.”
That was the first encounter.
Her form was engraved in my mind. She 
smiles in my mind's eye like a glittering 
yellow flame. The melody of that soft, sad, 
movie song as a silent ballad…
How many bewitching experiences in life!
Then…
Then what?
She and I became a couple. We blended into 
each other – and became one.
I trawl the bottom of my heart numbed by the 
sadness from the silent ballad.
We lived in our oneness. A magical life 
without sorrows or suffering – a life which 
made it impossible to imagine a greater 
paradise.
Mountain slopes draped in greenery, mountain 
streams gently rippling through, twisting and 
turning, trees bedecked with a riot of flowers, 
earth covered with lush meadows. The multi-
floor library that stands as the repository 
of knowledge. Lecture halls. She and I 
were inseparable everywhere, inseparable, 
inseparable, …
I daresay, “Life is when a man and a woman 
blend into one. Renouncing life is a lie. 
Literature that nudges one to hate life are lies. 
The argument that ‘Life is an illusion’ is a lie. 
Life is the truth. Truth is life. It is paradise. 
Just like the contrasts in hues, yellow–red–
blue-green, life is a blend of happiness-
suffering–sorrow-joy.”</p>

They were great experiences..
For a man and a woman to join, one need not 
look for compatibility in tribes, castes, beauty, 
or horoscopes; one only needs love. Love is 
tribe, love is beauty, love is compatibility.
I loved her. She loved me. We joined together; 
we became tight. I am not handsome. She 
is a beauty. She said I was handsome in her 
eyes; That there was none more handsome. I 
laughed. I understood what love is.
I keep my eyes closed. That silent ballad is 
somehow affecting me.
One day … …
She and I had a tiff.
I was in the library, reading a book by the 
English poet Keats. She came to beseech and 
beg. I did not budge. She sat next to me and</p>

mumbled, like all the musical energies joined 
in a soft, sad song…
I forgot myself and tried to embrace her. She 
laughed, her voice tinkles like a brass bell.
As far as I was concerned, she was a musical 
genius, a lover of the arts. Countless were the 
wonderful scenes of nature that she pointed 
out to me, describing their beauty. The 
mountain peaks north of the road, covered in 
mist, the mountain streams that shimmer like 
marble in the soft light of the morning sun, 
dew drops that glitter on the tips of blades 
of grass, leafless flower trees brimming with 
flowers, birds that fly in pairs in the dark 
silent sky…
We watched these scenes together, in our 
solitude. We forgot ourselves, engrossed in 
those scenes; we found joy in looking for our 
own meaning in them.
She would say, “You are an artist.” My 
friends would say, “Instead of using your 
creative talent to describe the suffering and 
life struggles in our society, you lose yourself 
in describing unimportant topics like nature, 
love, and individual human emotions.”
She would praise that my stories and poems 
were exquisite. I would report my friends’ 
criticisms. She would point to the birds flying 
overhead, and ask, “Do they not have life 
struggles? Hunger? How do they joyfully sing 
their birdsongs, and rejoice in nature?” She 
would say that life struggles persist as long as 
life persists. “It is only through the fine arts 
that we can forget ourselves and feel true joy,” 
she would declare.
I would nod in agreement. In complete 
agreement. When it came to life, art, and 
literature, we were of the same mind. Perhaps 
it was because of this that we could lose 
ourselves into completely becoming one. 
For a man and a woman to become one, 
love alone is not enough. Their minds need 
to be aligned, too. True life is the joining of 
two minds, blending emotions, and, hence 
blending souls.
I thought deeply about human feelings, the 
social contexts, and their effects, and wrote 
a poem. In that poem, titled ‘Life’s breath,’ I 
ended with the assertion, “Life is a collection 
of dreams.”
She saw that poem. Her eyes shone in bliss. 
“Life is a mass of dreams,” she said in 
Tamil first, and then translated the sentence 
into English, jumping with joy. She went 
overboard praising me.
“I did not write this poem by myself alone; 
you too became one with me and we wrote 
it together; this poem is nothing but my 
experience in blending with you.”
She blushed and smiled.
For some reason, I remembered our first 
meeting, with the melody of the sad ballad 
and the yellow hue.
I remain with my eyes closed. I can hear the 
whirring of the ceiling fans.
From the perspective of the corporeal eyes 
of this world, we did part ways. The world 
was immersed in semi-darkness then. It was 
drizzling. She was wearing a yellow sari and 
mumbled that sad song. The train arrived, 
belching out thick black smoke. I was the one 
who bid her farewell. She did not cry, nor 
did I. There was no reason for us to cry. Why 
should we cry? We do not suffer. Even if we 
did, is there some law that says we must cry?
I did indeed cry once. She did, too. After our 
first encounter in the bus, when she and I met 
at the park – when I understood her and she</p>

understood me – when she and I became one 
– we did cry then. For some reason, we felt 
the urge to cry. We cried until that urge was 
quenched.
Everyone says that we have broken up. But I 
do not believe that. We did not break up. No 
one can break us up. We are eternal lovers. 
She is within me and I would be within her; I 
would certainly be.
When we realized that we could not be 
together in this mundane earthly life – when 
we realized that we could not overcome 
the societal barriers, we did not launch 
a revolution against society. We are not 
revolutionaries. We are artists…
She then said, “We will live together forever. 
Only you will live in my heart forever; society 
is not capable of taking revenge on us. My 
soul will always seek yours. Society can do 
what it wants with my body. As long as I am 
alive, in some corner of this world, I will live 
as a faithful wife to you in my mind.”
My understanding of her was complete. Tears 
ran down my cheeks.
In the overt external life, she is wife to 
someone else. But in truth, she will remain 
my wife forever.
I will remain her husband; the half-darkness 
that shrouds this world, the drizzle, the yellow 
hue, the silent ballad…
“Thambi, have you fallen asleep?” A voice 
calls out.
I open my eyes. The clock is at half past four.
I stare through the window.
It is drizzling. The world lies sprawled. The 
silent ballad plays in my heart. Green, red, 
blue, yellow …</p>
