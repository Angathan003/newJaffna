O
n November 27, Maaveerar Naal, a video from the 
UK's Tamils Coordinating Committee, sparked global 
interest, especially in Tamil communities. It showed a 
woman claiming to be the daughter of the late LTTE 
leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. Her appearance and speech, 
reminiscent of Prabhakaran's Maaveerar Naal address until 
the LTTE's military defeat, fueled involvement in the Tamil 
Eelam cause. The contrast in her current and pre-2009 
demeanor raised doubts and intrigue about her identity and 
the video's authenticity.
In the video, the woman, dressed in a saree, claims that the 
Sri Lankan government defeated the LTTE with foreign 
aid, lacking courage for a direct confrontation. She argues 
that the LTTE's people-backed liberation struggle was 
strategically undermined by the government and asserts 
that the fight for political liberation is still ongoing. 
She accuses the United Nations and the international 
community of recognizing Sri Lanka's war crimes but 
not delivering justice to the Eelam Tamils. She concludes 
by emphasizing that, despite the end of armed conflict, 
the pursuit of political liberation continues, supported by 
Tamils in Sri Lanka, the diaspora, political figures, and ex-
LTTE members.
Authenticity Concerns
Although the video featuring a woman claiming to be 
Duwaraka, daughter of the late LTTE leader Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, was streamed on tamiloli.net and their 
YouTube channel for about 10 minutes, doubts about its 
authenticity surfaced quickly. It is widely believed that 
Duwaraka was killed in the final stages of the Sri Lankan 
civil war in May 2009. Notably, Duwaraka's body was 
not retrieved by the Sri Lankan army, but numerous 
LTTE cadres who reportedly fought alongside her in 
the final battle have testified that she indeed died on the 
battlefield. This skepticism is compounded by warnings 
from Sri Lankan intelligence and foreign agencies about 
AI-generated videos produced by a section of LTTE 
functionaries, aiming to falsely portray Duwaraka as alive 
and to fabricate a narrative for financial gain.

Former LTTE members who were 
part of the Eelam war's final battles 
at Mullivaikkal expressed strong 
beliefs that Prabhakaran and his 
family achieved 'veerachavu,' a 
term symbolizing martyrdom. They 
argued that their revered leader 
would not have fled the war zone and, 
importantly, would not have attempted 
to make his family escape, especially 
when thousands of other children and 
parents were dying in the conflict. This 
belief further fueled their skepticism 
regarding the video purporting to 
feature Duwaraka, leading them 
to question its authenticity and the 
motives behind its release after 14 
years. They suggested that the video 
could result from AI manipulation 
or an act by an imposter, given 
their conviction about the fate of 
Prabhakaran's family.
The Announcement and Supporting 
Voices
The claim of Duwaraka being 
alive was initially made public 
by Arunadevi Kumaradas, also 
known as Aruna, the elder sister of 
Mathivathani, in a video statement 
in August. She claimed to have met 
Prabhakaran, Mathivathani, and 
Dwaraka at an undisclosed location 
and confirmed they were safe and 
alive. That was supported by Indian 
politicians like Pazha Nedumaran and 
Kasi Ananthan, the Poet Laureate of 
Tamil Eelam.
In Sri Lanka, Kandasamy Inbarasa, 
president of the rehabilitated 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
party, stood out as the sole believer 
in the claim of Duwaraka being alive. 
He expressed his support for what 
he referred to as the re-emergence of 
"Tamil Eelam's princess, Dwarka." 
Inbarasa was adamant that the woman 
in the video was indeed Dwarka and 
criticized skeptics as being under 
the influence of the Sri Lankan 
government. He also expressed 
eagerness for Prabhakaran's potential 
comeback and LTTE intelligence chief 
Pottamaman's
Many cybercrime experts expressed 
skepticism. They pointed out several 
inconsistencies suggesting the use of 
artificial intelligence technology in its 
creation. They observed, "Although 
the language used by Duwaraka 
seems accurate, there are noticeable 
discrepancies in the movements of 
the mouth, face, and muscles. The 
video's lighting excessively focuses 
on the face, and the eye movements 
are unnaturally limited. Additionally, 
the hands are not clearly visible. 
These aspects indicate that the 
video was likely produced using 
basic technology." They regard the 
video as a potential case of identity 
theft conducted through the internet 
and note that it appears to have 
been hastily made with lower-end 
technology.
Political commentators in 
conversations with Jaffna Monitor 
expressed skepticism regarding 
Duwaraka surviving the war's final 
days. They specifically questioned 
the timing of the video's release, 
emphasizing the point, "Why wait 
14 years to appear?" if the woman 
in the video was indeed Duwaraka. 
The observers drew parallels between 
the enduring belief in Prabhakaran 
and his family's survival since 2009 
among the pro-LTTE diaspora and 
the longstanding mystery surrounding 
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's death.
Further, these analysts recognized 
the potential of a fraudulent 
syndicate operating behind the 
scenes, possibly using the video to 
exploit LTTE supporters financially. 
They considered the likelihood of 
someone falsely claiming to be 
Duwaraka as part of this scheme. 
In their concluding remarks, while 
they conveyed that nobody wished 
for her death, they firmly held on to 
their skepticism. They insisted on 
the necessity for credible evidence 
to verify the identity of the person in 
the video, maintaining that, without 
such proof, the claim of her being 
Duwaraka cannot be accepted.</p>
