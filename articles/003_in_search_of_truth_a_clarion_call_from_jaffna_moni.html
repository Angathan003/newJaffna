n the midst of rapid judgments categorizing us as anti-LTTE, it 
becomes essential to accurately present our position. At Jaffna 
Monitor, our team comprises young, unbiased individuals devoid of 
any political or ideological leanings. To the question of whether we 
are anti-LTTE, our unequivocal answer is no. On the contrary, we 
have always regarded the LTTE fighters with respect. Our formative 
years coincided with a period devoid of other freedom or militant 
groups, making the LTTE the sole operative entity. 
We have been keen observers of the LTTE's zenith, a period 
characterized by their successful establishment of a de facto 
government. This administration was marked by its own military 
forces, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, judicial 
system, and an extensive array of governance protocols. We have not 
only witnessed the rise of this administration but also its decline and 
eventual dissolution, much like a comet that burns brightly before 
fading away into the cosmos.
At Jaffna Monitor, our objective is to delve into the complexities of 
the past, seeking a deeper understanding of the pitfalls encountered 
in the Sri Lankan Tamils' quest for freedom. We recognize this 
inquiry as an intellectual pursuit and a solemn obligation to 
future generations. They must grasp the nuances of this struggle, 
discerning both the triumphs and the missteps, to fully comprehend 
the reasons behind our setbacks. Our approach to revisiting the 
histories associated with the LTTE is rooted in a desire to extract 
valuable lessons from these experiences. We wish to underscore that 
our intentions are purely educational. Our analysis aims to foster 
understanding and learning without any intention of undermining 
the LTTE or the sacrifices of its fighters.
Our investigative endeavors at Jaffna Monitor are informed by 
a wealth of firsthand accounts from numerous ex-high-ranking 
officials of the LTTE. These individuals, now integral to our mission 
of uncovering the truth and learning from historical misjudgments, 
have devoted a substantial portion of their lives to their cause. 
Remarkably, several of these sources have been affiliated with the 
LTTE for over a quarter of a century, their lives deeply intertwined 
with the movement's history and legacy.
This deep-rooted connection to the LTTE's inner workings lends a 
unique credibility to their perspectives, shaping our narrative with 
authenticity and insight. Such invaluable contributions fortify our

resolve against hasty accusations of being anti-LTTE. The reality is 
quite the contrary: many of these revered LTTE veterans not only 
endorse our mission but actively participate in it. Their support 
underscores our commitment to a balanced and truthful exploration 
of the past, transcending simplistic labels and focusing on the broader 
goal of understanding and learning.
Acknowledging the positive experiences under the LTTE's 
governance is essential, many of which we at Jaffna Monitor observed 
firsthand during our childhood. Notable among these were the 
enhanced safety for women, who could walk without fear even at 
midnight, the development of innovative self-sufficiency strategies, 
the active empowerment of young people, and the adept management 
of scarce resources.
We welcome and encourage voices from diverse perspectives to 
partake in our dialogue. We invite contributions that shed light 
on the positive aspects of the LTTE, ensuring that these narratives 
are included in our discourse. All submissions that contribute 
constructively to this discussion will be duly published.
It is important, however, to approach this subject with sensitivity 
and responsibility. We advocate for a discourse that acknowledges 
achievements without glorifying acts of violence, bombings, or 
killings. Our goal is to create a balanced and thoughtful exploration 
of history, one that recognizes the complexity of the LTTE's legacy 
without condoning violence.
To those who critique our work, we extend an invitation to engage 
in a constructive dialogue of reflection and learning. Jaffna Monitor 
is committed to being more than just a publication; we strive to be 
a beacon of balanced journalism. Our mission is not to serve as a 
vehicle for propaganda but rather to illuminate the diverse aspects of 
our shared history.
We firmly believe that an unbiased exploration of the past, free 
from allegiance to any particular group or ideology, is crucial. Our 
allegiance is solely with the truth. A thorough understanding of our 
history is key to shaping a more promising future. We encourage our 
critics to join us in this endeavor. Together, we can contribute to a 
narrative that is not only informed and nuanced but also forward-
looking, fostering reconciliation and progress.
