A 
recent study by the independent think tank Advocata has highlighted the undue 
financial strain placed on women in Sri Lanka due to current taxation policies. 
These findings come at a critical time as the country undergoes a review of its bailout 
program by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the delegation including 
female members, underlining the issue's significance.
The study reveals that nearly 52% of Sri Lanka's population, which is female, is bearing 
the brunt of a steep increase in the cost of menstrual hygiene products. This surge has 
led to around 40% of women, aged between 15 to 47 years, ceasing the purchase of 
sanitary products, which annually cost them about Rs. 4,500.
In the wake of an economic downturn characterized by mismanagement, corruption, 
and the embezzlement of public funds, the government's emphasis on revenue 
generation, even at the expense of essential women's products, has been a source of 
growing concern and criticism. There are fears that such policies might pave the way 
for more aggressive taxation measures.
Despite women's vital role in various economic sectors, their needs are being 
consistently overlooked in policymaking. This neglect was starkly evident on 
International Women's Day, where male politicians expressed verbal support for 
women but did not address the high taxation on critical products such as sanitary 
napkins.
In the nation's Parliament, a handful of female MPs have been vocally pushing for 
more reasonable pricing of women's hygiene products. However, their campaigns 
have largely fallen on deaf ears in a legislature dominated by male voices. Notably, 
Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has been an active supporter of this cause, yet 
he, too, faces ridicule from government MPs.
The issue is compounded by the insufficient representation of women in Parliament, 
signalling a dire need for broader female political participation.
There is also a call for more expansive social support initiatives, such as improving 
school facilities with proper sanitation for underprivileged children. Opposition 
Leader Premadasa's efforts in enhancing educational infrastructure set an example 
for other political figures to follow.
At the heart of this issue lies an urgent requirement for governmental policy 
realignment, focusing more on the welfare of its citizens, particularly the vulnerable 
segments. Addressing the taxation on women's hygiene products and children's 
school supplies is not only beneficial but essential, intersecting the realms of economic 
policy, social justice, and gender equality.</p>

Story
A
t first I gave the title ‘The X Group’ to this story. It is 
a story about two former Tamil militants. Both had 
migrated to Europe many years ago as political refugees. 
I did not know which militant groups they belonged to or 
whether they belonged to the same group. An important 
story-telling technique for this story is to advance the 
story while keeping the reader wondering which groups 
these two men belonged to, sustaining the mystery even 
after the story has been told. Therefore, I followed the 
hallowed tradition of denoting the unknown by the 
The F Group

short story F iyakkam (,af;fk;)<br />

symbol ‘X,’ to call the story ‘The X Group.’
I was in for a shock when a friend of mine, 
as soon as he heard the title, asked me, “Is 
this a story about the Red Front of Tamil 
Eelamists?” It was only then, after a very 
long time, I remembered that a Tamil militant 
group called RFTE did indeed exist until 
1985. My friend was a consummate expert 
on the history of the Eelam struggle. He 
had in fact authored two research articles 
on the topic. In confusion, I asked him, 
“How can you tell me that it is a story about 
RFTE without even reading the story?” He 
responded, “The leader of that group was 
called Xavier. So, X represents the first letter 
of his name.”
I was astonished that he would guess 
such a connection existed. Although ‘X’ 
was a common symbol widely used from 
mathematics to pornographic movies, I did 
not immediately comprehend that it could also 
represent the first letter of a militant group 
leader’s name. On sober reflection, I realized 
that many such pivots and shifts in meaning 
had taken place during the past twenty-five 
years. Earlier, cakkai used to mean pomace or 
bagasse, the weak, useless stuff that remains 
after useful juice has been extracted out of 
fruits or vegetables. But now cakkai refers 
to a potent explosive that can completely 
pulverize the target without leaving anything 
behind. Earlier to put on a poṭṭu was 
auspicious, but now it referred to making a 
woman a widow. Even the verb ‘to kill’ has 
many neologisms in popular usage among 
Tamil militant groups: ‘dumping’, ‘hitting on 
the head’, ‘knocking’, and ‘maṭṭai.’
Since I was very keen to not leave any room 
for readers to guess which militant groups 
our dramatis personae belonged to, I resolved 
to look for a different letter instead of ‘X.’ 
Only when I attempted to find an alternative 
letter, did it dawn on me that this was not an 
easy task. English has only twenty-six letters. 
But our struggle has had thirty-seven militant 
groups and countless leaders. I started from 
the letter ‘A’:
A — Aruḷar
B — Bālakumar
C — Chandrahāsaṉ
D — Douglas Dēvāṉandā
E — EPRLF, ENDLF, and so on
F — …
G — Gñāṉasēkaraṉ alias Paranthaṉ Rājaṉ
H — Hensy Mohaṉ
I — Inbam
J — Jegaṉ
K — Karuṇā
L — LTTE
M — Muhunthaṉ
N — NLFT
O — Oberoi Thēvaṉ, .. and so the list 
continued, leaving only the letter ‘F’ 
unoccupied. Therefore, I have adapted it. Now 
let’s see if you can still make guesses.
He left Paris on a Lufthansa plane. He would 
transit in Frankfurt to board the plane to 
Colombo. After going through checking at 
Frankfurt, he boarded the plane to Colombo 
and took his seat. The seat next to him lay 
empty. His instinct told him that a beautiful 
German girl would come to take that seat. But 
the reality was that his instinct was lousy at 
making predictions that would come true.
At least once a month, his instinct had told 
him that his father would pass away any 
day. But bedridden and sick, appā was still 
clinging on to life. Whenever the phone rang 
in the wee hours of the morning, he expected 
news of appā’s death. For a long time, he 
anguished over the question of whether 
he should go to Sri Lanka to see appā. 
Sometimes he hoped that if news about appā 
did indeed arrive, it would deliver him from 
the suffering of this anguish. Once, when he 
got drunk in the evening, he slapped himself</p>

silly as penance for harboring such a thought.
It was customary for his friends at work to 
acquiesce to requests for money from their 
families and friends in Vavuniya or Colombo. 
Those requests were for religious festivals 
like Deepāvaḷi or New Year, or for special 
occasions like weddings, or for education. But 
neither his elder sisters nor brothers-in-law 
ever asked for money for such reasons. They 
always asked for help in dealing with appā’s 
illness, like money to take him for treatment 
in Colombo or India. But it didn’t appear 
that they ever moved appā even an inch from 
the mat on the floor where appā languished. 
Sometimes one sister would ask for money 
without the knowledge of the other, or they 
would complain about each other. They came 
up with new excuses for not taking appā to 
Colombo for treatment. When he quizzed his 
brother-in-law about this, the response put the 
blame squarely on the political situation in the 
country, flinging obscenities to curse the dead 
husband of Chandrika Bandaranaike and the</p>

mother of Ranil Wickremasinghe and the wife 
of Mahinda Rajapakse. Sometimes he thought 
if anyone were to ask him, “How long has 
your father been ill?” he should reply, “From 
the Chandrika Kumaratunge era.” It seemed 
like appā was a hostage to his sisters, like a 
ship that had been boarded by Somali pirates. 
Appā was of ripe old age. But they would 
not let the old man die. No abductor would 
willingly lose possession of the object on 
which he is demanding ransom.
He wondered whether he thinks like this 
because he had lost his love for his father and 
siblings. On deeper reflection, he realized that 
it is not just about appā but that he truly loved 
no one and no one loved him. He thought that 
external compulsions pushed one to pretend 
to love. He often murmured the well-known 
saying in the diaspora, ‘All familial ties are 
because of money.’ Just like the greeting 
‘vaṇakkam’ or the word ‘visa’, this saying, 
too, has become a normal part of the diasporic 
lingo.
But last week when his elder sister called 
him on the phone and said, “Appā will not 
make it through this time,” and that he wakes 
up with a start from time to time asking if 
he had come back to Sri Lanka to see him, 
he finally decided to go to see his father one 
last time. When his mother died, he had been 
in France for just three years. Ammā’s body 
was cremated without a son at hand to light 
the pyre. Appā had wept, praying to avoid a 
similar fate. As soon as he decided to go to 
Jaffna, his mind went into a tumult. Visions 
of his village and relatives and friends all 
trooped into his mind, making him a little 
afraid. When he imagined wearing a veṭṭi 
to light appā’s funeral pyre, he felt a sense 
of unease. When he put on his seat belt in 
the plane, his instinct told him that the news 
of appā’s death would await him when he 
landed.
Moments before the plane was ready to 
depart, a fat, dark-complexioned man walked 
towards his seat in a somewhat agitated state. 
The fat man’s eyes darted between him and 
the empty seat next to him, without even 
a smile in greeting. Eventually, as if there 
was no choice, the fat man squeezed into the 
empty seat with a stern expression, struggled 
to put the seat belt on, and started reading the 
German magazine. He glanced furtively at the 
address tag on the bag that stood behind the 
fat man’s legs and struggled to read it. It said, 
‘Arumaināyagam Theivēnthiraṉ, Dortmund, 
Germany.’
For half an hour after the plane took off, he 
had tried everything, clasping and unclasping 
his fingers, rocking his legs, and so on. He felt 
that he had reached the point that continued 
silence was no longer appropriate. He looked 
at his neighbor through the corner of his eye. 
He felt that the neighbor did not avert his 
gaze but returned it. He was full of questions. 
As he rehearsed his opening line and turned 
to speak, the neighbor broke the silence first. 
The conversation started with a silly question.
“Are you Tamil?”
He told his neighbor that he would go to 
Jaffna from Colombo because his father was 
on his deathbed. The neighbor said essentially 
the same thing, about having a mother who 
was on her deathbed from mouth cancer, in 
a Jaffna village. When the neighbor asked 
if he was married, he lied and said, “yes.” 
The neighbor said he worked in a printing 
press in Germany and had three children. He 
responded that he worked at a supermarket 
in Paris, and that he had been in France 
for twenty years. The neighbor had been 
in Germany for twenty years. Both were 
returning to Sri Lanka for the first time since 
they left the country. He said his name was 
Chandran. The neighbor responded with the 
name ‘Māṟaṉ.’
He had already noticed that the address tag on</p>

the carry-on bag indicated that the neighbor’s 
name was ‘Arumaināyagam Theivēnthiraṉ,’ 
so he guessed that Māṟaṉ may be a nickname. 
During the conversation, it occurred to him 
that he had seen his neighbor somewhere. 
While his tongue kept on talking, his eyes 
were trying to penetrate Māṟaṉ’s eyes. 
Suddenly he felt a chill down his spine. 
He was certain that he had seen Māṟaṉ 
somewhere before, and the image of Māṟaṉ 
holding a gun began to form in his mind. The 
image was hazy, painted with smoke. His 
instinct warned him that his neighbor was 
from a militant group. At the same instant 
when he stopped talking and turned his gaze 
towards the window, the neighbor, seemingly 
relieved, leaned back on the seat with eyes 
closed. He racked his brain trying to recall 
where he had met Māṟaṉ before.
1984 March
After the landmine explosion next to the 
Buddhist vihāra in Jaffna, the army emerged 
from Jaffna fort and burnt down a part of the 
Periyakadai area. After an hour of frenzied 
destruction, as the army left the city, the 
militant groups entered it.
The boys from the militant groups transported 
the injured off the road, and the dead bodies 
that lined the road and lay inside shops. They 
commandeered vehicles along the road to 
facilitate transportation. When news emerged 
that the army was heading out on foot from 
the Nāvatkuḻi army camp, the boys grabbed 
their guns and hurried towards Nāvatkuḻi 
on bicycles and motorcycles. Some fighters 
were impatiently waiting to donate blood to 
the wounded they had brought to the General 
Hospital. The big doctor signaled them to 
come inside to donate blood, leaving their 
guns outside.
The announcement over the plane’s public 
address system instructed passengers to fasten 
their seat belts again. The plane had hit some 
turbulence and was heaving up and down. 
He glanced at the display in front of him and 
noticed that they were flying over Bulgaria. 
He turned his head towards his neighbor. 
Māṟaṉ was reading a newspaper. Those eyes, 
nose, and thick lips were unforgettable. But 
he could not recall exactly where he had seen 
them. He was sure he saw them with a gun.
1985 July
All militant groups, protesting that the peace 
talks under way in Bhutan would not bring 
salvation to the Tamil people, had launched a 
great march from Maruthaṉāmadam towards 
the University of Jaffna campus. School girls 
walked first, followed by the general public, 
with vehicles bringing up the rear. Boys from 
the militant groups lined up on either side of 
the marching column to ensure that it moved 
in a disciplined manner. Different militant 
groups had taken over different tasks in 
managing the march. They shouted slogans in 
unison.
“Is Bhutan your grandpa’s house?
“No, no to talks, Tamil Eelam till our last 
breath!”
“We won’t be fooled by the Thimphu 
theater!”
“We won’t sell out our principles; We won’t 
betray our martyrs!”
When the people marching reached the 
university campus and sat down, the play 
‘maṇ sumantha mēṉiyar’ was performed. 
In the public meeting that followed, 
representatives from all militant groups 
addressed the crowd. Since the second level 
leadership of many groups were among the 
speakers, armed bodyguards stood watch 
around the stage.
When the stewardess came around with</p>

tea, his neighbor took the teacup from her 
and handed it to him. He smiled back in 
thanks. Māṟaṉ returned the smile. He had 
definitely seen this smile before. The smile, 
accompanied by a gun.
1986 April
Under the cover of darkness, the navy had 
advanced from their Kārainagar base and 
camped out at St. Antony’s College in Kayts. 
Before dawn, a militant group laid siege 
around the college. Inside there were at least 
two hundred sailors. Outside, there were 
barely twenty fighters. They had only one 
M16, two G3s, six AK 47s, four submachine 
guns, one repeater gun, and some hand 
grenades. The navy had artillery and rocket-
propelled grenades. A helicopter hovered over 
the college.
At around seven in the morning, the boys 
from the militant group commenced their 
attack. All twenty of them were hiding behind 
boundary walls and on leafy trees. The boys 
behind the wall stood up from different places 
at different times to shoot at their targets 
and throw hand grenades. The helicopter 
began its fireworks. It was shot at, too. The 
navy trapped inside kept shooting in all 
directions without letting up. When a young 
boy — perhaps seventeen — stood up with a 
submachine gun, his head was shattered by 
the navy’s light anti-tank weapon fire.
At around eight, two helicopters landed 
special commando forces at a salina, a small 
distance from St. Antony’s College. The 
commandos advanced towards the college 
at breakneck speed. This put the boys in a 
real bind. They had the navy in front of them 
and the commandos in their rear. Although 
they had the possibility of a retreat, it did not 
look like they wanted to. They had divided 
up into two groups and were shooting in both 
directions, as if they had decided to die that 
day.
As the noose tightened and it seemed like the 
boys from the militant group could not escape,</p>

a different militant group came through 
Meliñchimuṉai to attack the commando force 
from its rear. This group had two-inch mortars 
of their own manufacture. The commandos 
were totally shaken. They changed direction 
to retreat towards the sea at Thambaddy. Now 
this other group with their mortars approached 
the navy camp at St. Antony’s College. When 
this group goes into battle, it does so with 
at least fifty people. Not all of them were 
necessarily trained fighters; sometimes they 
rallied village folk into battle; if there were 
not enough guns, they were armed with sticks 
and poles.
The two militant groups left the eastern flank 
open for the navy to retreat and surrounded 
them on the remaining three sides. By about 
ten, other groups had shown up with whatever 
arms they could muster. If one group ran out 
of ammunition, another group lent some. 
Injured fighters from different groups were 
transported away in the same vehicles. By 
about five in the afternoon, the navy started</p>

to retreat. The militant groups chased them 
as far as the beach. The next day, one group 
published a pamphlet saying, “thank you to 
comrades who stood shoulder to shoulder 
with us.”
The purser announced that the plane was 
about to land. He had exerted every cell in 
his brain trying to recall, in vain, where he 
had seen his neighbor before. He was rolling 
his eyes and biting his lips. He resolved that 
as soon as he disembarked, he would go on 
his way without running into Māṟaṉ. The 
neighbor then asked, “Where are you going to 
stay in Colombo?” Startled, he answered, after 
a moment’s hesitation, that he was not going 
to stay in Colombo and had already bought 
a plane ticket to Jaffna in the morning. That 
was a total fabrication. His sister would be 
waiting at the airport in Colombo. He would 
have to discuss with her before deciding when 
to go to Jaffna. The neighbor smiled with his 
eyes, evidently in pleasant surprise, and said, 
“I, too, am flying to Jaffna in the morning. 
I guess we will meet again on the plane 
tomorrow.” He, too, smiled, pretending to be 
pleasantly surprised. But he was smoldering 
inside. He thought that if only the fat man 
was holding a gun now, he would surely have 
made a positive identification. He decided 
that it would be futile for him to expend more 
effort on trying to remember where he had 
seen Māṟaṉ before. He resolved that it would 
be wiser to stay out of sight from Māṟaṉ once 
he landed.
At the airport, Māṟaṉ followed him to the 
immigration counter. He cleverly let Māṟaṉ 
go ahead of him in the lineup for immigration. 
He could overhear Māṟaṉ speak in Sinhala 
to the immigration officer. He himself did 
not know a word of Sinhala. Seeing Māṟaṉ 
speak in Sinhala somehow saddened him. 
After passing immigration, he looked around. 
The fat man from Frankfurt was nowhere to 
be found. He made a beeline to the restroom, 
locked the door and stayed put inside for a 
while.
‘Perhaps I have a brain fog that is making my 
memory hazy, but there is little chance that 
the fat man would have had similar trouble 
remembering me. Perhaps he recognized me 
right away at first sight. Even when he was 
chatting with me, he was using the technique 
of repeating what I said. Even his name, 
Māṟaṉ, is not a common name in Jaffna. 
Names like Māṟaṉ, Parithi, Sangili, were 
adopted by fighters from militant groups.’ As 
he was musing thus, he remembered that his 
nom de guerre in his own militant group was 
Peter. He remembered the proverb from the 
Bible that said, ‘Those who live by the sword 
die by the sword.’ Standing in the restroom, 
he was perturbed thinking, “I should have 
stayed put in Paris, where I withdrew into my 
shell for twenty years. Now having returned 
to step foot on my land once again because of 
my love for appā, I am confronted with fear 
and left without peace of mind.” Swear words 
about his father were on the tip of his tongue. 
He grew worried about how long he had spent 
inside the washroom. Concerned that it might 
lead to new problems, he reluctantly opened 
the door and stopped out.
The fat man Māṟaṉ was waiting outside the 
restroom. They pretended not to have seen 
each other. He walked with a steady gait 
towards the baggage claim area. His bag was 
circling on the luggage carousel all alone. He 
grabbed it and hurried outside.
Outside, the area for people waiting to receive 
arriving travelers was crowded. Sinhala and 
Tamil conversations filled the air noisily. 
Not finding his elder sister, he was flustered. 
Seeing him standing alone, some people 
approached him to ask something in Sinhala. 
He walked past them with a forced smile. 
His eyes darted hither and thither looking 
for the fat man, Māṟaṉ. Eventually he went</p>

to stand next to a policeman standing guard 
with a gun. Strangely, that gave him a sense 
of security and calm. Eventually when his 
elder sister and brother-in-law found him, 
he snarled at them. His brother-in-law said 
that their vehicle was ready. He walked 
towards the vehicle listlessly. He was a little 
apprehensive about leaving the side of the 
policeman. In fact, writing a story about him 
is draining. It is difficult to understand what 
he would be thinking, what would worry him, 
what would make him happy, or what would 
rattle him. As if this is not trouble enough, his 
instinct tends to drag the story in a different 
direction.
With his sister and brother-in-law, he stayed at 
a lodge in Colpetty. His brother-in-law asked 
him, “When should we fly to Jaffna?” He 
responded, “Let us stay in Colombo for a few 
days to do a bit of sight-seeing.” Their faces 
brightened up on hearing this. His sister said, 
“There are a lot of things to see in Colombo.” 
He grumbled silently that the old man was</p>

on his deathbed but they wanted to go sight-
seeing in Colombo. But his instinct told him 
it would not be wise to go to Jaffna now. If he 
closed his eyes, the dark face of the fat man 
Māṟaṉ appeared in front of him to torment 
him.
When his sister and brother-in-law went 
sightseeing, he feigned illness and stayed put 
in his room for two days. He did not even 
want to walk around in Colombo but curled 
up into a ball and stayed on his bed. There 
were militant groups in the north and militant 
groups in the south. He did not even know 
where to stretch his legs on the bed. He even 
considered returning to France but felt that it 
was not right to run away when news of his 
father’s death could arrive at any time. Once 
again, he felt the urge to see appā’s face once 
before he passed on. The same urge overcame 
him once before in Paris and had dragged him 
to this point. Once he felt this urge, he thought 
perhaps meeting Māṟaṉ on the plane was just 
an ordinary occurrence, and that the feeling of 
having seen him before with a gun could also 
have been an illusion. He had consumed the 
half-a-bottle of white wine he was served on 
the flight over from Paris and had topped it up 
with three glasses of wine at Frankfurt airport. 
He knew that wine could in fact induce 
fantastically imaginative hallucinations. Once, 
when he went to work at the supermarket 
drunk, he had shelved cans of cat food on the 
shelves meant for baby food. Cat food cans 
have labels with cat faces. Baby food cans 
have labels with faces of babies. That day, 
cats had appeared like babies to him.
Once he decided that he would go to see his 
father, he went out to buy flight tickets to 
Jaffna. The ticket agent was just across the 
street from the lodge. When he emerged from 
the lodge and crossed the street, he saw the 
fat man Māṟaṉ standing next to a tea shop. 
His feet refused to move. He recovered within 
an instant and started walking in the opposite 
direction. He knew that Māṟaṉ had seen him. 
What was he doing here? Did he not say 
that he was traveling to Jaffna the day after 
he arrived in Sri Lanka? He was walking 
towards the beach. But rattled, he turned to 
walk towards the Colpetty police station. 
Occasionally, on the pretext of adjusting his 
shoes, he stopped to glance back.
That night, he told his brother-in-law that they 
must change to a different lodge. His brother-
in-law was utterly confounded. They moved 
to another lodge in Kotahena. His sister was 
keen to buy the clothing necessary for their 
father’s funeral. She said it was not easy to 
find good quality clothing in Jaffna, and even 
if they did, the prices tended to be exorbitant. 
She bought a veṭṭi for him, and clothes for the 
grandchildren who would have to hold aloft 
lighted torches during the funeral rituals.
He left the room only to go out to eat. He told 
his sister that the scorching sun did not agree 
with his constitution. On the fourth day at 
the new lodge, he returned to his room after 
breakfast with a newfound enthusiasm. Relief 
had washed over his face. He told his brother-
in-law to buy tickets to Jaffna right away. 
His village, his relatives, and old friendships 
rejuvenated within him. When he imagined 
appā’’s funeral, and lighting the pyre in his 
new veṭṭi, he was thrilled. The news of the 
death had reached him that morning. It was 
published in the rolled-up newspaper in his 
hand, accompanied by a photo of that dark 
fat man. The man, a native of Jaffna 3rd 
Cross street, and a resident of Germany, 
had been shot dead in Jaffna Hospital Road 
by unidentified assailants on a motorcycle. 
For some reason, he carefully placed that 
newspaper in his bag and closed it.
Thus ended this story, with a whimper.
