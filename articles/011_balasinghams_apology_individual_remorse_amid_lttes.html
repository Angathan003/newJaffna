Regardless, with this as their rationale, the LTTE 
labeled the Chavakachcheri Muslims as "traitors" 
and felt obliged to act. On October 15, 1990, around 
1,500 Muslims, mainly from the Dutch road in 
Chavakachcheri, were expelled under threat of 
firearms. They were robbed of their belongings and 
only allowed to take a pair of clothes and a mere 150 
rupees. 
Following the forced expulsion of Muslims from 
Chavakachcheri, the directive spread to Mannar 
district, with Marichukkatty residents ordered to leave 
on October 23 and all Muslims in the Musali AGA 
division, a region with a sizable Muslim population, 
told to evacuate the next day. This wave extended to 
Mannar Island, where Muslims were ordered by the 
LTTE to evacuate by October 28, leading to their 
displacement to Kalpitiya via a 60-mile sea journey.
Throughout these areas, Muslims were allowed to 
keep only a pair of clothes and 150 rupees, losing most 
of their possessions. They underwent rigorous body 
searches at checkpoints, with some even required to 
fully undress for inspections.
This pattern of forced removals spread to the Northern 
Wanni mainland. Muslims in Mullaitheevu were 
instructed to leave within a week on October 22, and 
those in Kilinochchi were given a five-day eviction 
notice on October 23. They were permitted only 
minimal belongings and subjected to strict body 
checks at checkpoints.
Jaffna's Moral Dilemma
 The LTTE forcefully expelled 72,000 Muslims 
from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka in 1990, 
not just uprooting them from their homes but also 
robbing them of their belongings. This act of mass 
displacement, coupled with the looting of personal 
and valuable possessions, marked a profound injustice 
against a vulnerable minority group. This large-scale 
expulsion underscores the immense human cost of the 
conflict, extending far beyond mere displacement to 
encompass a profound loss of livelihood and heritage.
The forced eviction of Muslims reveals a profound 
irony. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
which sought to champion the rights of the Tamil 
minority in Sri Lanka, inflicted egregious harm upon 
Balasingham's Apology: 
Individual Remorse Amid 
LTTE's Silence
Anton Balasingham, the chief political strategist and 
negotiator for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE), did indeed offer an apology for the expulsion 
of the Muslim community from the Northern Province 
of Sri Lanka. During the peace talks facilitated by 
Norway in 2002, Balasingham addressed the issue, 
describing the expulsion as a "political blunder" and 
acknowledging the suffering that it caused to the 
Muslim population.
Balasingham’s apology was a notable moment as it 
was an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by a senior 
representative of the LTTE. However, it should be 
noted that this apology, while significant, did not come 
from the LTTE as an official apology. After its defeat in 
2009. various Tamil political parties and leaders, some 
with former ties to the LTTE, have recognized the 
injustices faced by the Muslim community and called 
for reconciliation.
Amidst the 2002-2006 ceasefire and dialogue, the 
LTTE allowed Muslims, previously driven from their 
homes, to revisit and potentially reclaim their lands. 
Despite this, a complete resettlement did not unfold 
during this period of tentative peace.
Defending the Indefensible:
After the forced removal of Muslims, some ardent 
LTTE backers rationalized the action, alleging that 
Muslims had secretly allied with the Sri Lankan 
government. They accused the community of using 
mosques to relay strategic information to the military 
via walkie-talkies, thus posing a security threat. 
However, when challenged to provide proof, the 
accusations typically fell back on unsubstantiated 
rumours and lacked any concrete evidence.
Despite the passage of time, certain LTTE adherents 
still perpetuate these claims, insisting that Muslims 
served as government informants and used mosques 
as hubs for intelligence exchange. Such allegations, 
often repeated without factual backing, remain 
prevalent in some quarters, perpetuating a story 
detached from its original context.</p>

the Muslim community – a group that was itself 
a smaller minority in the northern regions of the 
country. This act stands as a haunting reminder of the 
complexities and moral contradictions in the struggle 
for minority rights.
The role of the Jaffna Tamils during this crisis is also 
a subject of introspection. Their silence as the events 
unfolded paints a troubling picture of communal 
conflicts, where inaction can inadvertently contribute 
to the oppression of a vulnerable minority.
Years after the end of Sri Lanka's civil conflict and 
the dissolution of the LTTE, the repercussions of this 
forced displacement continue to affect many. While 
some Muslims from Jaffna have managed to find new 
beginnings elsewhere, a considerable number remain 
in refugee camps, enduring hardships and a lack of 
basic amenities. This situation highlights the enduring 
nature of the wounds inflicted during such conflicts.
Reflecting on this episode in the history of Northern 
Sri Lanka, it is evident that the plight of the Jaffna 
Muslims is more than a historical footnote; it is a stark 
reminder of the destructive impact of ethnic conflicts 
and the ongoing struggle for justice and equity. This 
story, marked by loss and resilience, underscores 
the need for comprehensive efforts to address the 
concerns of all minority communities and to foster 
reconciliation and peace in a nation still healing from 
its divided past.
Silent Spectators, Active Buyers: 
Jaffna's Duality in the 1990 LTTE Looting
The Tamils of Jaffna bore witness, almost unanimously 
and in silence, to this grave injustice. This pervasive 
silence, while partly due to fear of the LTTE's wrath, 
does not entirely absolve the moral complexities 
involved.
Following the expulsion of Muslims from Jaffna, the 
LTTE's economic division took a significant role in 
managing the looted belongings of the displaced 
Muslims. These items, encompassing a wide array of 
personal and household goods, were made available 
for purchase by the local Tamil population. The sales 
were conducted at LTTE-run outlets, widely known as 
'Makkal Kadai.' These outlets became focal points for 
the distribution of the looted goods within the Tamil 
community.
Many Tamils, seizing this opportunity, lined up to buy 
these items. Offered at relatively affordable prices, the 
goods were accessible to a more significant segment of 
the population. The sale featured a variety of personal 
effects, furniture, and other household items that had 
been seized from the Muslim community during their 
forced evacuation.
The LTTE's looting was extensive; homes formerly 
belonging to Muslims were left barren, stripped 
of tiles, wooden frames, doors, and windows. The 
plundered furniture and other personal effects 
eventually made their way into Tamil homes through 
these LTTE-run outlets. This extensive transfer of 
property became evident when, after the ceasefire, 
returning Muslims often recognized their belongings 
in Tamil households and establishments.
Furthermore, the LTTE's actions extended beyond 
movable property. They also sold properties owned 
by Muslims, including houses, lands, and vehicles, 
through illicit transactions. This effectively erased 
the Muslim community's ownership and presence in 
these areas. Such actions by the LTTE were part of a 
deliberate strategy to permanently disrupt the lives of 
the displaced Muslim community.</p>

In our Jaffna neighborhood, Kanthasamy Iya, 
renowned for his piety and modesty, often mused 
about the enigmatic nature of karma. Reflecting on the 
LTTE's expulsion of Muslims from Jaffna on October 
30, 1990, Iya observed a somber pattern of cosmic 
justice. For five years, silence prevailed among the 
Jaffna Tamils, many of whom were mute spectators 
or even supporters of the expulsion, while a section 
profited from the Muslims' misfortune.
However, on the same date in 1995, a twist of fate saw 
these Jaffna Tamils, including those who had remained 
passive or benefited from the situation, being forced 
into a similar plight of displacement under the same 
night sky. This turn of events, as if dictated by an 
unseen force, seemed to balance the scales of karma. 
Iya concluded, "Indeed, karma is a relentless mistress, 
Thampi."

Returning Home: The Crucial 
Reintegration of Muslims in the 
Northern Landscape
For centuries, Muslims have been an integral part of 
the northern region's community, living in harmony 
with Tamil neighbours. Their distinct architectural 
landmarks remain prominent in urban Jaffna, while 
their contributions to tailoring, commerce, and 
various other industries have significantly shaped 
the culture of northern cities. In the rural and village 
landscapes, both Muslim and Tamil families were 
essential to the agriculture and fishing sectors. It is 
against this backdrop that the return of Muslims to 
the North emerges as a crucial element for fostering a 
pluralistic and resilient future in the region.
Staggered Return: Jaffna's 
Displaced Muslims and the 
Struggle for Resettlement
In the aftermath of the 2009 conflict's end, the Muslim 
community has slowly started to make its way back 
to the northern regions, albeit with no definitive 
resettlement plan from the government. Out of the 
8,000 displaced Muslim families from Jaffna, only 
2,000 have registered to return, and of these, just 700 
have succeeded in returning to their original homes. 
These uprooted families face a barrage of social and 
economic obstacles, including bureaucratic hurdles in 
accessing war victim housing grants, contested claims 
over their properties, and scant support for rebuilding 
their livelihoods. Amidst these challenges, progress on 
the housing front has been limited.</p>
