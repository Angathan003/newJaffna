Sampanthan's Extended Use 
of State House and Cars 
Sparks Controversy
Mr Sampanthan and his relatives continue to 
reside in the accommodation provided to him 
during his service as the Opposition Leader 
from 2015 to 2019. His extended stay in the 
government residence raises concerns about 
the potential misuse of the entitlements 
and advantages afforded to high-
ranking officials. The annual cost of 
utilities and maintenance for the 
house, which runs into hundreds 
of thousands of rupees, is a 
financial burden on the taxpayers. 
Moreover, according to civil service 
insiders, the two vehicles allotted for 
his official use as Opposition Leader 
are reportedly still being used for 
personal and familial purposes.
Critics often point out Mr Sampanthan's questionable 
discernment in people, highlighting his controversial 
decision to nominate the former Supreme Court 
Judge C.V. Wigneswaran for Chief Minister of the 
Northern Provincial Council, despite significant 
internal resistance from the TNA. This move proved 
to be detrimental, affecting not just the functioning of 
the Provincial Council but also tarnishing the TNA's 
image and standing both within the local community 
and beyond.
Secret Ballot, Open Comedy
The TNA's pledge of unity under Mr Sampanthan's 
leadership took a comedic turn in the secret ballot for 
the president. Despite a public declaration to back Dullas 
Alahapperuma, some TNA parliamentarians played a game 
of political 'Guess Who?', casting votes for the then-Prime 
Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instead. Wickremesinghe, 
in a moment of presidential banter during his first meeting 
with the TNA, quipped, “I know some of you voted for 
me.” The TNA's internal coherence has since seemed like a 
political sitcom, unravelling even further for all to see.
Sampanthan's Oversight: Tamil 
Demands and Yahapalana 
Disappointments<br />
Sampanthan has faced significant criticism both locally and 
internationally for his performance as the Leader of the 
Opposition. He is charged with failing to address or influence 
any substantial national matters affecting all communities. 
There were allegations that he was overly accommodating to 
the then-governing Yahapalana coalition rather than 
asserting the interests of his constituents.
Despite playing a pivotal role in orchestrating a 
united front of opposition parties that led to the 
ousting of the formidable President Mahinda 
Rajapaksa in 2015, Sampanthan did not manage 
to secure a resolution for Tamil demands from the 
succeeding Yahapalana government. In retrospect, 
he may recognize the missed opportunity for 
more robust negotiations, such as leveraging the 
threat of toppling the government by opposing 
critical measures, like the budget, to fulfil 
his party's objectives. His reserved stance 
ultimately led to the Tamil community 
receiving little to no concessions. This 
perceived strategic and tactical deficit was 
starkly highlighted four years on, resulting in 
the TNA facing a significant backlash from the 
Tamil electorate in the 2020 elections.
Judgment in Jeopardy
Sampanthan's Leadership 
Falters as TNA Fragments
Sampanthan's tenure as Leader was marked 
by his inability to maintain solidarity within 
the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), as critical 
groups such as the Ceylon Tamil Congress 
(CTC) and the Eelam People’s Revolutionary 
Liberation Front (EPRLF), as well as prominent 
figures like Mr C.V. Wigneswaran, distanced 
themselves. The subsequent formation of 
the Democratic TNA (dTNA) has effectively 
isolated ITAK and underscored Mr. 
Sampanthan's ineffective leadership. This has 
not only weakened the TNA's political front but 
also signalled a missed opportunity to advance 
the Tamil cause under his stewardship.</p>
