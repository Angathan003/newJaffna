diff erences in their vision. Some of these diff erences were 
subtle, yet they were signifi cant enough to set them apart 
from the views of the LTTE’s leader, Prabhakaran. Given 
the profound impact of their untimely demise, there 
should be a dedicated day to remember and honour their 
sacrifi ces, ensuring their legacies are never forgotten.
Remembering Civilian Victims
Looking beyond the militant ranks and political ambitions, 
it is crucial to shed light on the distressing ordeals endured 
by numerous Tamil civilians who became entangled in the 
LTTE’s web of violence, particularly during the fi nal phases 
of the Sri Lankan civil war. It became increasingly evident 
that the LTTE showed no hesitation in targeting its people. 
Individuals who attempted to escape LTTE-controlled areas 
were ruthlessly labelled as traitors and faced execution. 
Tamil individuals who dared to speak out against LTTE’s 
brutal recruitment strategy oft en became targets of the very 
organisation that claimed to champion their cause. Th ese 
brave individuals were silenced through violent means, 
leaving behind a haunting legacy of suppression. Th e 
horrifying extent of the LTTE’s brutality extended even to 
the sacred family bonds. Some fathers found themselves in 
the crosshairs of the LTTE and were mercilessly targeted 
and killed for the simple act of protecting their sons and 
daughters from forced conscription by the organisation.
In light of these immense tragedies, the lack of an offi  cial 
day to honour those who suff ered at the hands of the 
LTTE stands out starkly. Th eir tales of sacrifi ce, enduring 
pain, and lost lives warrant a distinct place in our shared 
history. Establishing such a commemorative day would not 
only immortalise their memories but also emphasise the 
paramount importance of preserving freedom of expression 
and valuing a diversity of opinions.
Th e recent Supreme Court decision confi rming 
the removal of ex-Minister Naseer Ahmad 
from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) 
has led to the forfeiture of his position in the 
parliament. In his place, Ali Zahir Moulana 
has taken the oath as a Member of Parliament, 
representing the SLMC. Th is verdict is 
consequential for political entities, emphasizing 
the importance of upholding discipline 
and discouraging members from switching 
allegiances for personal benefi ts rather than 
genuine political reasons.
Th is decision empowers political parties to 
foster consistency and unity within their ranks. 
It indicates that members acting against the 
party’s collective decisions risk losing their 
parliamentary positions. Given the present 
political dynamics, such a ruling is poised to 
assist both the ruling and opposition parties 
preserve stability.

The Dual Legacy 
of Thileepan
R
ecent incidents involving the 
vandalization of a memorial fl oat 
commemorating Th ileepan by a 
Sinhala mob have brought his multifaceted 
legacy back into the spotlight.
Th ileepan's determination during 
his fast unto death is unquestionably 
commendable, bearing a resemblance to 
acts like that of the Buddhist monk Th ích 
Quảng Đức, who died by self-immolation. 
Yet, it's crucial to consider his commitment 
in the context of his broader life journey.
While Th ileepan has oft en been referred 
to as the Gandhian face of the LTTE, 
eyewitness accounts suggest a history 
interwoven with acts of armed violence. 
For instance, it's documented in "Broken 
Palmyra" that Th ileepan had participated 
in public executions, notably a lamp post 
killing in Urumpirai merely months before 
his notable hunger strike. Such acts starkly 
contrast the peaceful image associated with 
Gandhian principles.
Another dark chapter in Th ileepan's 
past is his alleged involvement in the 
abduction and murder of Premanda, the 
brother of Douglas Devananda, a former 
militant turned cabinet minister. Other 
episodes include the ruthless elimination 
of a principled Jaff na University student, 
Vijitharan, followed by threats against 
protesting student union members, 
culminating in the fatal shooting of 
Vimaleswaran, another student activist.
Th e accusations don't end there. 
Th ileepan's purported role in killing young 
TELO militants, including child soldiers 
suff ering from severe eye diseases, paints 
a picture of a man whose actions were 
sometimes driven by extreme and violent 
ideologies. Th e episode at the Vattukkottai-
Mavadi camp, where he reportedly showed 
no mercy even to ailing child soldiers, is a 
testament to this.
It is clear that LTTE and its leader, 
Velupillai Prabhakaran, leveraged 
Th ileepan's hunger strike for political gain, 
rallying the Sri Lankan Tamils behind 
the LTTE's separatist cause. Th is strategy 
simultaneously catapulted Th ileepan into a 
position of reverence while obscuring the 
more violent aspects of his legacy.

However, while refl ecting on Th ileepan's legacy, today's 
political manoeuvres around his memory should not be 
overlooked. Th e Tamil National People's Front (TNPF), 
representing a segment of Sri Lankan Tamils, appears 
to capitalize on the profound sentiment associated with 
Th ileepan. Th is fringe political party and its national list 
MP, Selvarajah Kajendran, recently organized a rally that 
intriguingly passed through multiple Sinhala villages 
and towns, raising eyebrows about its intentions. Given 
the already delicate ethnic landscape of Sri Lanka, some 
intellectuals within the Tamil community argue that 
such actions by TNPF could risk further ethnic unrest. 
But beyond these political actions, their assertion as 
the singular authority on commemorating Th ileepan is 
viewed by many as deplorable. While most Sri Lankan 
Tamils hold a deep personal sentiment towards Th ileepan, 
TNPF's apparent aim to monopolize this collective grief, 
purportedly to amass funds from the Tamil diaspora, has 
cast a shadow on their motives.
It's essential to strike a balance in our understanding. 
Celebrating Th ileepan solely as a peace-loving individual 
disregards the numerous accounts of his involvement in 
armed aggression. Conversely, reducing him merely to a 
violent militant doesn't do justice to the genuine conviction 
he displayed during his hunger strike. Understanding 
Th ileepan requires acknowledging his multifaceted nature. 
However, it is equally vital to remember the broader 
context and his violent undertakings.
In reality, Th ileepan's life juxtaposes deep conviction and 
aggressive militarism. His dual legacy refl ects the broader 
complexities surrounding the LTTE and the Sri Lankan 
confl ict, reminding us of the importance of nuanced 
historical analysis. However, as we refl ect upon this, the 
current political plays, mainly by entities like the TNPF, 
urge us to remain vigilant and discerning.</p>

F
our decades aft er civil war disruptions severed 
the vital maritime link between India and Sri 
Lanka, ferry services have triumphantly resumed 
as of October 14th. Th is signifi cant event has been 
celebrated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who 
see it as a pivotal step towards strengthening bilateral 
ties, enhancing connectivity, promoting trade, and 
revitalizing cultural links between the two nations.
Th e renewed ferry service connecting Tamil Nadu’s 
Nagapattinam and Kankesanthurai in Jaff na, Srilanka, 
aims to rekindle the age-old maritime connections that 
have historically existed between these neighbouring 
countries.
Th e newly launched high-speed ferry, named 
‘Cheriyapani,’ is operated by the Shipping Corporation 
of India (SCI) and boasts a capacity of 150 passengers.

Kankesanthurai, the journey takes about 3.5 
hours, depending on sea conditions.
During its inaugural voyage, the ‘Cheriyapani’ 
ferry carried 50 passengers from India to Sri 
Lanka and returned with 38 passengers in 
the evening. Th ese passengers expressed joy 
at the opportunity to sail to Sri Lanka and 
experience this historic moment.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
emphasized the signifi cance of the ferry 
service, stating that it not only brings the two 
cities closer but also fosters closer ties between 
the people and hearts of India and Sri Lanka. 
He described this as the beginning a new 
chapter in diplomatic and economic relations 
between the two countries.
Modi underlined the shared history of culture, 
commerce, and civilization between India and 
Sri Lanka, pointing out that Nagapattinam 
and nearby towns have been renowned for 
sea trade with various countries, including Sri 
Lanka. He also noted the historical importance 
of the port of Poompuhar, which is mentioned 
as a hub in ancient Tamil literature.
Additionally, Modi mentioned the 
literary works of the Sangam age, such as 
‘Pattinappalai’ and ‘Manimekalai’, which 
describe the movement of boats and ships 
between the two countries. He invoked the 
great poet Subramania Bharti’s song ‘Sindhu 
Nadhiyin Misai,’ which mentions a bridge 
connecting India and Sri Lanka and highlights 
how the ferry service rekindles these historical 
and cultural connections.
Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe 
expressed his enthusiasm, stating that the ferry 
service is crucial in enhancing connectivity 
between the two nations. He refl ected on the 
historical signifi cance of people traversing 
the Palk Strait for thousands of years, 
contributing to developing their cultures and 
trade. Wickremesinghe credited the return of 
peace as the catalyst for re-establishing this 
sea connectivity. He thanked Prime Minister 
Modi and the Indian Shipping Corporation for 
making it a reality.
T
he commencement of a passenger ferry service between 
Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province and 
Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu last week marks the fulfi lment of 
a long standing demand across the Palk Strait for the revival 
of a sea link. Sri Lanka’s civil war, which lasted nearly 25 
years, had disrupted the movement of people and goods on 
traditional maritime routes — Talaimannar to Rameswaram 
and Colombo to Th oothukudi. Twelve years ago, a ferry 
service between Colombo and Th oothukudi 
did not last long due to a lack of patronage. 
Th ere was also the popular Boat Mail 
connecting Chennai and Talaimannar via 
Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi through 
a rail link and a ferry, which nonagenarians 
recall. Th e cyclone in December 1964, 
which devastated Dhanushkodi, and the 
civil war ended the multiple transport links, forcing peoples 
in both countries to rely only on air services, which cover 
Madurai and Trichy too these days. Ten months ago, the 
Chennai Jaff na air service resumed, and according to an 
estimate, 10,000 tourists from India visited Sri Lanka over 
six months. Th e inauguration of a private cruise service in 
Chennai four months ago facilitated visits by 6,000 passengers 
to the island nation. As pointed out during the launch of the 
Nagapattinam Kankesanthurai service, the development would 
not only strengthen cultural, economic, and civilisational 
ties but also improve cooperation in disaster management 
and maritime security. It may, at some stage, also enable the 
seamless voluntary repatriation of thousands of refugees from 
Sri Lanka living in Tamil Nadu. Normal operations of the 
service — it ran for a few days this month — are to resume 
in January in view of the northeast monsoon. By then, it is 
hoped that the authorities, especially in India, would take 
steps in the interest of the sustainability of the ferry service. 
With a fare of around ₹7,670 a person for a journey, the 
diff erence between this rate and airfares is not competitive 
enough for anyone to opt for the ferry. Increasing the baggage 
allowance of 50 kg would help. Th e provision of amenities at 
Nagapattinam port, such as a dormitory and improving rail 
connectivity at Nagapattinam, require attention, as passengers 
from Sri Lanka are sure to want to visit Chennai. On the part 
of Sri Lanka, economists, policymakers, and activists should 
consider promoting economic ties, including exports from the 
Northern Province, given the inherent asymmetrical bilateral 
relationship. Ultimately, sustained policy attention is critical 
to making this service a success. Aft er all, Nagapattinam 
is predominantly agrarian and one of the economically 
backward spots of Tamil Nadu. So, it is up to the governments 
of the two countries to ensure that the Nagapattinam-
Kankesanthurai ferry service does not meet the fate of the 
Th oothukudi Colombo service.<br />

Monsoon Suspends Ferry Until January
Th e ferry service aimed to boost religious tourism 
between the two countries, given the proximity of 
numerous pilgrimage sites. Notably, spiritual centers such 
as Velankannai, Nagore, and Th irunallar are situated near 
Nagapattinam. Additionally, destinations like Th anjavur, 
Madurai, and Trichy are within a reasonable distance. 
Similarly, historic temples like the Naguleswaram 
and Maviddapuram Kandaswamy are located near 
Kankesanthurai.

Indian External Aff airs Minister S. Jaishankar 
hailed this milestone as a “big step for people-
to-people contacts between India and Sri 
Lanka.”
Th is initiative seeks to revive historical 
maritime connections from the early 1900s 
when the Indo-Ceylon Express, a train 
service between Chennai and Colombo via 
Th oothukudi, ceased operations in 1982 due 
to the civil war in Sri Lanka.
Th e resumption of ferry services marks a 
signifi cant step towards rekindling historical 
ties and forging stronger relations between 
India and Sri Lanka in the modern era. As 
the ferry ‘Cheriyapani plies the waters of the 
Palk Strait, it carries with it the hope of a 
brighter future and the rekindling of cultural 
and economic exchanges between these two 
South Asian neighbours.
Archaeological 
excavations in and around 
Nagapattinam have 
uncovered relics, pottery, 
and artefacts that indicate 
direct evidence specifi c 
to the Nagapattinam-
Kankesanthurai ferry 
route’s history of maritime 
trade and interactions. 
Th ese discoveries 
corroborate the historical 
signifi cance of the region’s 
maritime connections.
Sangam literature, which dates back over two thousand 
years, references maritime trade and voyages between 
India and Sri Lanka. Works such as the ‘Pattinappalai’ 
and ‘Manimekalai’ describe these regions’ active trade 
and cultural ties. “Pattinappalai” represents the beauty 
and prosperity of ancient Tamil port cities, including 
Poompuhar. In this Sangam work, Poompuhar is celebrated 
for its maritime trade, bustling port activities, and its role as 
a signifi cant trading centre during the Sangam period. 
Th e historical link between Nagapattinam and 
Kankesanthurai dates back approximately 3000 years to 
ancient times when both regions fl ourished as bustling 
maritime trade hubs. Historical records show these 
coastal towns were pivotal in facilitating trade between 
India and Sri Lanka. Th ey were vital conduits for
