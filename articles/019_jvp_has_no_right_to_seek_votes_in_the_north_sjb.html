n a strong statement, Samagi Jana 
Balawegaya (SJB) General Secretary Ranjith 
Madduma Bandara MP asserted that the 
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has no 
moral right to campaign in the Northern 
Province. He pointed to the party's historical 
opposition to the India-Sri Lanka Agreement 
and the Provincial Council system, stating, 
"Those who raised the war flag against the 13th 
Amendment back then, like the JVP, do not 
have the right to go to the North and ask for 
votes. Our party, however, represents all ethnic 
groups."
Bandara went on to emphasize the violent 
history of the JVP's resistance to the Provincial 
Council system, claiming that the party was 
responsible for killing those who supported 
the 13th Amendment and participated in 
Provincial Council elections. "The JVP also 
targeted officials who facilitated Indian 
assistance programs and called for a boycott 
of Indian goods," he remarked, further 
underscoring the party's actions during that 
period.
Turning to his own party's stance, Bandara 
expressed confidence in SJB leader Sajith 
Premadasa's support from the Northern 
electorate. He noted, "The people of the North 
have recognized Sajith Premadasa as the leader 
capable of delivering the devolution of power 
and development they desire." According to 
Bandara, several prominent Tamil leaders 
have publicly endorsed Premadasa, and the 
people of both the Northern and Eastern 
provinces are rallying behind him. "When 
Sajith visited these regions, he was met with an 
overwhelming welcome," Bandara added.

n a utopian world, this would be the moment to say the heir to 
the throne is taking over from the incumbent. However, for Sri 
Lanka Cricket, a utopia is as distant as water is to a rabid dog. Thus, 
this moment isn't what it could have been.
A decade ago, when Sri Lanka defeated England in an away Test 
series for the first time, Angelo Mathews was the center of attention. 
A century at Lord's, a century against all odds to construct an 
unimaginable win, and captain of the side—Angelo was living the 
dream he had been destined for since his youth. After all, while

most aspiring players dream of earning a place 
in provincial or national age-group teams, this 
man received calls from coaches asking him to 
play. He was special, and he was proving why. 
With the imminent exits of Sanga and Mahela, 
Angelo was expected to take the throne of Sri 
Lanka Cricket for the next decade.
What followed, unfortunately, was far from 
what anyone would have hoped for. Angelo's 
decline was akin to a major stock market 
crash, wiping out the value of surrounding 
stocks without reason. Saying Angelo's stock 
plummeted would be an understatement—it 
sank even further. Along with it, the fortunes 
and hopes of Sri Lankan cricket took a 
nosedive. The throne fell to the ground, 
gathering dust and rust. There was no one 
worthy of claiming the seat once fought for 
and worn not by just the best but by the best of 
the best.
Fast forward a decade, and to his credit, 
Angelo has hung in there. It hasn't been easy. 
Everyone has opinions—we may never know 
what's right or wrong, but he's still there.</p>

Credit to him, he remains a vital figure in the 
longer format of the game. While his career 
may not have unfolded the way we once 
hoped, everything he achieved up until 2014 
would still surpass what 95% of international 
cricketers could ever dream of. You can't take 
that away from him.
In that sense, it was fitting that it was Angelo 
who walked in to join the present-day 
cynosure of all eyes, Pathum. It was a moment 
Sri Lanka could have let slip—they've done 
so before, and they surely could have again. 
Thankfully, the hero of the last victory and 
the hero of this one stood together, guiding 
Sri Lanka to triumph and bringing light to Sri 
Lankan hearts on a gloomy English evening.
Pathum may not yet be the rightful heir to 
the throne, but he surely will be. If you're 
wondering why, here's the reason: many 
players take time to master formats, even the 
likes of Kohli and Rohit weren't exceptions. 
Rohit, for instance, was an enigma—a white-
ball rockstar since 2013/14 but only truly 
found his place in Test cricket by 2019/20. 
It takes time because it's tough. But Pathum 
seems different. Ever since that bout of dengue 
and his re-entry against Afghanistan, the man 
has been on a mission. His white-ball game 
has shattered the shackles and is right up there. 
What's even more intriguing is how he has 
made his comeback at The Oval.
One match is a small sample, but sometimes, 
it doesn't take much to recognize true talent. 
Game recognizes the game, and that's why the 
Sky Sports panel was raving over Pathum's 
exploits. His second-innings knock wasn't a 
surprise, given the way he played in the first 
innings. Some innings signal what the future 
holds, and this was Pathum's moment.

We've seen glimpses of brilliance from 
Kusal Mendis and Kusal Janith, but they 
only reached those heights once and never 
repeated them. With Pathum, it feels different. 
Sometimes, you just know. It's hard to explain, 
but Pathum gives you that feeling—something 
that can't be quantified.
In one way or another, this moment wasn't 
what it should ideally have been, but it is 
what it is. A man who could be the face of Sri 
Lankan Cricket in future, embracing the man 
who was that for some time in the past in what 
undoubtedly is one of our greatest highs.
Not everything works out the way we expect, 
but it's the hope that it will that keeps us 
coming back, time and again, despite countless 
heartbreaks.
Pictures tell stories, and this one certainly 
does.</p>

Kānchipuram temple, celebrated in the saiva hymn 
thiruvāsakam.
To whom else can one appeal so cheaply.

Chee, spit that word out.
Apparently, he snivels! He grieves!
Isn’t there a desolate wasteland nearby, 
overgrown with cacti and babul trees? If there 
is, go lament there! Pour your tears in there!
Like all men, you conveniently philosophize 
after you have had your downfall; but did you, 
even for a moment, understand, nay try to 
understand, the heart of Sarasā?
You know how to lift your pen without shame 
and write. But if she – she, whose heart is as 
soft as her silky body – happens to see this?
Why would you worry about that prospect?
2
When Sarasā came to join my school, I was 
startled.
What a beauty! She was wearing an ordinary 
saree. It struggled to completely conceal the 
beauty of her body, her slender fair hips.
Her thick locks lay shyly on her chest with 
pride, twisting and turning.
Those eyes – those blue eyes – she evidently 
knew their worth. She never lifted them to 
gaze at anyone. Only mother earth had the 
ability to withstand that gaze.
Poor her, she didn’t really know how to wear 
a saree. She is barely a woman!
She struggled to walk, as her saree made a 
‘sadak, sadak’ noise.
Do you know the irresistible urge one gets to 
scoop up a toddler learning to walk because 
one fears that they are going to trip and fall? 
One gets the same urge when one sees Sarasā 
walk in a saree.
When her delicate feet touch the ground, I 
marvel, wondering if there are a thousand 
hearts that are being trampled.
Jealousy never leaves anyone alone!
When the other students came to complain 
to me saying “Sarasā seems to be going 
somewhere at night,” I was shocked.
Sarasā? I could not believe my ears.
But that night, I had to do the deed.
3
The next morning, she came to me with her 
eyes teary and downcast.
“Miss! Do I really have to go?”
“Sarasā… the news has spread throughout the 
entire hostel. Even the principal has ordered 
me to dismiss you. I am so sorry. But what 
can I do!”
“Miss! Do tell me Miss, what great crime 
have I committed?”
“He liked me; I liked him, too. Even after 
realizing that it was ‘wrong’, we were 
so mesmerized that we couldn’t control 
ourselves. If we had come to our senses, 
would we have behaved like this? We acted as 
though we were intoxicated.”
“Miss, is this an unforgivable sin? How easily 
do you kick me out of the school … …”
“But… … think about it Miss… … tomorrow</p>

the society will treat me worse than a worm 
that wriggles in the phlegm that someone spat 
out. Is that acceptable?”
“You are a woman too. Who else can 
understand my lapse?”
Her last question shook me!
“Isn’t a school meant to reform those who 
erred, rather than punish them by discarding 
them?”
How can I respond?
“Sarasā, tell me the truth. How did this 
happen?”
The floodgates opened. She poured her heart 
out.
I was overwhelmed.</p>

“Miss, I don’t care about leaving the school… 
… but, just three more days… … couldn’t 
you have waited just three more days?”
She sobbed uncontrollably.
“You have asked me many times: ‘why are 
you knitting this sweater?’ I concealed the 
reason from you. It is his birthday in just three 
days. I poured my dreams into this lovingly 
knit sweater. To whom will I give it now? 
Who will it fit except his broad shoulders?”
“How will I see him again?” she sobbed. I 
couldn’t even console her.
4
Although she went on to train as a nurse, she 
did not forget me. She wrote often. Her first 
letter … …
“My future is dark; there is darkness in my 
heart; there is darkness along the way; how 
will I face my father!”
“I pushed open the gate, and it felt as though I 
was pushing the entire world with my hand.”
“My father – that sightless, bony old man – 
was eating on the porch. Next to him was my 
dear sister, barely twelve. She took into her 
tender hands the responsibility for cooking so 
that her elder sister could go off to study. She 
was making the rice into balls to feed him.
“Sarasā, how come you are so early?” he 
stretched his hands towards me, his voice 
dripping with concern.
“Aiyō! Why didn’t a drop dead of a heart 
attack in that instant? Why didn’t my heart 
break into a hundred pieces and kill me? I 
did, without shame, tell everything to my 
blind father who had dreamed day and night 
‘Sarasā will become a weaving teacher within 
three months; after that our troubles will melt 
away.’”
“If he had beat me up then, I would have had 
some solace.”
“I bore the grief of watching him eat the rice 
ball in his hand, mixed with teardrops.
“My sister - the little child - cried at my feet 
without understanding why. I bore those 
priceless tears, too.
“It is not that I didn’t know how to take my 
life. But… but …”
“When I remember those happy days when 
we sat by the temple pond, gazing into each 
other’s eyes till eternity, hope blossomed in 
some distant corner of my heart.”
“We will lean over the pond to look at the 
reflection of the full moon in the pond.”
“We threw pebbles into the pond, breaking 
that full moon into a thousand pieces, and 
laughed out loud for no reason.”
“Suddenly he would lie on my lap and count 
the stars in the sky without end.”
“How many promises we made on those stars, 
and on the full moon.
“urutikaḷ kōṭi ceytōm <br />
[We made a million 
commitments]
  uṉmattarāyiruntōm.” <br />
[we were 
intoxicated]
“Yes, we were intoxicated.”
“Why are this full moon and the millions of</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
59
stars still sticking to the sky?”
“Hey, twinkling star, do you still believe his 
promise?”
“Hey, full moon, what sin did I commit to 
make him forget me so quickly?”
“Did that Rāju forget this innocent damsel! 
Has he, for whose sake I endured all the 
suffering in this world, and bore all the world’s 
insults, even forgotten that Sarasā is alive?”
“He never responded to all those letters I 
wrote with my tears.”
“Do you know the reason why?”
“Miss, my fingers tremble with shame even to 
write these words.”
“It seems he is afraid of all the insults thrown</p>

my way. It seems I have earned a bad 
reputation in the village.”
“Is an innocent woman’s love so cheap? So 
forgettable so quickly?”
5
As soon as her training was completed, she 
got a job at the Jaffna General Hospital. 
I expected her to forget him at least from 
then on, but I was disappointed. In fact, she 
was rather naive. She kept on yearning for a 
miracle. This is what she told me …
“It has been six months since I started 
working as a nurse, Miss. In all these days… 
in all these days, he didn’t come to see me 
even once. He didn’t even try. I am a woman. 
I have learned to bottle up my feelings. What 
else can I do?”
“But he is a man! Had he wanted, couldn’t he

She sobbed uncontrollably.
She bared her heart to me as she would to a 
friend, without holding anything back.
“Has he, who had held my two fingers and 
declared ‘I will wait for an eternity for these 
fingers to touch me’, forgotten me in a mere 
two and a half years?”
Another day, she came to see me, sweating 
profusely. “Why at this time?” I asked.
“Do you know Dr. Chandrasēkar? He is 
transferring out of here. We had a farewell for 
him, so I couldn’t come in the middle of it,” 
she heaved a huge sigh.
It was election season; there were at least nine 
or ten surgeries each day. Sarasā barely got a 
break. To add to the rush, the chief doctor had 
taken the day off.
At around 1:00 am, the eleventh surgery 
was in progress. Sarasā was holding out one 
surgical instrument after another. She could 
see beads of sweat in the doctor’s forehead. 
Feeling that it was her duty, she took a piece 
of lint and dabbed the sweat off the doctor’s 
brows.
For some reason, the doctor put the instrument 
down and gazed sharply into her eyes. Then 
using the same piece of cloth, dabbed her own 
sweat off her face. All that took just a moment. 
No one saw.
A tingling sensation ran down her entire body. 
That day, he popped the question under that 
dome lamp. He offered an opportunity that 
she had not even imagined. But she turned 
him down without a moment’s hesitation. She 
had no doubt whatsoever that she belonged 
to someone else. If she had wanted it… all it 
would have taken was for her lips to move… 
… but she did not want that.
Is not the fact that Dr. Chandresekar is leaving 
today after having requested a transfer a 
testament for the depth of her love?
But she didn’t know how to express that 
love. As if confirming the folk wisdom that 
womenfolk are naive, she counted days, 
holding on to the faint ray of hope.

As usual, the Point Pedro bus dropped her off 
at the Kalviyankadu junction. Her house was 
just a stone’s throw from there. If one takes 
the shortcut towards Senguntha College, it is 
just around the corner. But the cat-eyed twins’ 
shop was on the way and there was always a 
crowd there.
Whenever she passes it, whistles and lewd 
comments would ricochet off her ears. In that 
moment, Sarasā would cringe, and her heart 
would wilt.
Just to avoid this embarrassment, she would 
take the long way by the southern end of 
Sangiliyan Thoppu.
That day was no different.
As she passed the ayurvedic doctor’s house by 
the Jak tree, she spotted someone coming on a 
bicycle. Her heart skipped a beat.
It was him. Rāju.
As he crossed the junction and rode towards 
her, her heart raced. A thousand thoughts 
rumbled and filled her mind. “How will 
he start? What will he talk about? What 
if someone sees us”. She slowed down 
expectantly, with latent desire.
She sensed that he was near and was staring at</p>

her. Expectations bubbled up in her heart.
But he didn’t stop. He kept on going!
But it would have been a mercy had he kept 
on going. She could sense him stop at the 
bicycle shop far behind her. He turned and 
bicycled towards her again, But not alone. A 
bīdi puffing gem of a friend was in the back 
seat.
It was as if he was boasting: “I recognized 
you! But see! I didn’t lose my resolve!”. How 
did so much deceit latch on to the half-smile 
that made his lips curl?
As the bicycle whizzed past her, the 
wonderful friend’s quip, “the nurse’s uniform 
is sexy!” grated in her ears. The guffaw that 
followed underscored the quip.
“Dear Rāju! When did you succumb to this 
crowd?”
How could I not cry when she said “Miss, my 
Rāju, my dear Rāju is long dead”?

She didn’t come by for many days. I went to 
the hospital myself. That was the first time 
I saw her in a nurse’s uniform. The delicate 
lines of youth were still replete in every 
part of her body. She was running around, 
focussed on her duties as she chatted with me.
“Miss! Rāju came here. It was just a regular 
fever. I am not sure what made him come. 
But… but… he has changed a lot.”
“The evil notion that a “nurse” is not a 
woman, not an object worthy of love, had 
somehow taken root in his mind.”
“Tell me Miss! Is a nurse someone to be 
looked down upon?”
“His gaze that used to be full of love, has now 
been tainted with desire. That kind gaze now 
reeked of lust. I am even ashamed to recount 
what happened. The only thing left in his gaze 
was the fire that wanted to taste every part of 
my body.”
“He couldn’t understand my heart. But he still 
wanted to stake his claim. He wanted me not 
to see or talk to other patients.”
“If he didn’t like me working as a nurse, he 
could have uttered just one word back then 
and I would have stopped. But now, every 
patient is like a child to me.”
Sarasā! Who, but I, can truly understand her 
innocent heart. What did she tell me? Only I 
know that. “Miss! I will stay like this. No one 
will melt me. I can imagine no one but him as 
my husband. But… … but … … I will never 
get my old Rāju back.”
After that the streaming tears laid her heart 
bare.
I know that she will never get married. But no 
one else will understand that.</p>
<hr />
<p>You know only to plead “Kachchi Ēkampā!”
Ēkampāṉ my foot!
You can philosophize after falling down.
Did you try even for a moment to understand 
Sarasā’s heart?
What is the point in lamenting now?
