Monitor Memo
Jaffna-Trichy Flights Take 
Off After 50 Years
I
ndiGo Airlines is set to launch daily flights 
between Tiruchirappalli (Trichy), India, 
and Jaffna, Sri Lanka, starting from March 
30, 2025. This marks the revival of a historic 
air route last operated by Air Ceylon nearly 
five decades ago, re-establishing a crucial air 
link that once played a vital role in connecting 
Tamil Nadu with Jaffna.
The reintroduction of the Trichy-Jaffna route 
is expected to strengthen trade, tourism, and 
cultural ties between the two regions, which 
share deep-rooted historical and ethnic 
connections. It also becomes the shortest 
international air route from South India and 
the second-shortest in India, providing a 
faster and more convenient travel alternative. 
The shortest international air route in India 
remains the Bagdogra-Paro flight operated 
by Druk Air, covering a distance of just 137 
kilometers between India and Bhutan.
The aerial distance between Trichy and Jaffna 
is approximately 184 kilometers (114 miles), 
making it half the distance between Jaffna and 
Ratmalana Airport (329 kilometers) in Sri 
Lanka. This striking comparison underscores 
the fact that Trichy is geographically closer 
to Jaffna than Sri Lanka’s commercial capital, 
Colombo.
According to IndiGo, flights will operate daily, 
departing from Trichy at 7:35 AM and arriving 
in Jaffna at 9:00 AM, while the return flight 
from Jaffna will take off at 2:00 PM and land in 
Trichy by 3:25 PM. However, the actual flight 
time is expected to be less than 30 minutes, 
according to sources.
Air Ceylon, Sri Lanka’s former national airline, 
operated flights on this route until 1979, 
offering a key connection between

T
he year 2023 descended upon Sri 
Lanka like a storm—a relentless 
tempest of economic hardship. Fuel 
lines stretched for miles, power 
flickered and failed, and the weight 
of financial despair bore down on 
every household. The ghosts of 
the pandemic still lingered, while 
the echoes of the Aragalaya’s fiery 
protests reverberated through the 
streets. In this crucible, survival 
became a daily, desperate struggle.
Amidst this turmoil, within the walls of EPSB, 
a private electrical company, another tragedy 
unfolded. My mother, who managed EPSB, 
watched helplessly as the lifeblood of the 
company slowly ebbed away. Projects dwind-
led, the once-bustling workshop fell silent, and 
the agonizing decision to temporarily lay off 
staff loomed like a dark cloud.
Among those affected was Viraj Jayasinghe—a 
man who was more than just an employee; he 
was a beacon of warmth within the company. 
Despite the economic pressures, Viraj 
remained a cherished member of the team, 
known for his kindness and willingness to 
help others. Recently married and the father of 
an 11-month-old daughter, he embodied the 
essence of a devoted family man.
The evening of February 14th-Valentine’s 
Day-a day meant for whispered affections 
and tender gestures, twisted into a nightmare.

Viraj, on a simple errand, fulfilling his duty as 
a husband and father to stock the pantry, set 
out for groceries. He could never have known 
that this ordinary task would be his last.
On his return journey, he encountered a scene 
that would spark a tragedy—three teenage 
boys, reckless and wild, their motorcycles 
roaring down the street. A flicker of concern, 
the instinct of a father, stirred within him. 
“There are little children walking on this road,” 
he warned—a simple plea for caution, a gentle 
admonition meant to protect.
But his words, intended to safeguard, were met 
with brutal fury. A confrontation erupted—a 
senseless, violent clash. Ironically, the boys 
were students from the very school where 
Viraj’s wife, his beloved, taught. One of them, 
consumed by a rage beyond reason, seized 
a motorcycle helmet and struck Viraj—
again and again. The blows were merciless, 
relentless.
Then, silence. Viraj collapsed, his world fading 
into darkness.
His wife, gripped by a growing dread as 
he failed to return, began a frantic search. 
She found him—broken, lifeless—on the 
roadside. The desperate race to Aluthgama 
Seenawaththa Hospital was in vain.
Ranga Viraj Jayasinghe—a husband, a father, 
a son—was gone. Just like that, at 34 years old, 
his life was stolen, leaving behind a gaping 
void: a widow drowning in unbearable grief 
and an infant who would never know her 
father’s embrace.
The autopsy—a cold, clinical recitation 
of brutality—revealed the truth: internal 
bleeding beneath the skull, exacerbated by 
the vicious assault. Within two days, the three 
teenage assailants, Grade 11 students, were 
apprehended by the Welipenna Police. They 
were remanded at the Child Detention Center 
in Makola and later appeared before the 
Matugama Magistrate’s Court.
Adding to the tragedy, the teenagers, when 
questioned, appeared disturbingly placid, 
claiming they had no idea Viraj was their 
teacher’s husband. Even more shockingly, their 
parents confronted Viraj’s grieving wife—not 
with remorse, but with blame, questioning 
why her husband had dared to challenge their 
children.
The Aftermath: Dilki’s Struggle for 
Justice
For Dilki, Viraj’s widow, the tragedy did not 
end with his brutal death—it only deepened in 
the agonizing months that followed.
The three teenage assailants were remanded 
at the Makola Child Detention Center, but 
what should have been a place of reflection 
and consequence became a haven of privilege. 
Reports emerged that they were treated 
like honored guests—enjoying gourmet 
meals, comfortable accommodations, and 
personal counseling sessions. They were even 
transported in luxury vehicles, shielded from 
the weight of their crime.
Their initial bail applications were denied, 
in part due to shocking evidence presented 
in court—child protection officers had 
taken them to a high-end restaurant for an 
extravagant meal while they were supposedly 
in detention. The revelation sent waves of 
outrage through those seeking justice, but the 
system remained indifferent.
A Cruel Smear Campaign
As if Viraj’s murder wasn’t enough, Dilki’s 
pain was compounded by a malicious lie. 
A senior official from the Child Protection 
Authority appeared on journalist Chamuditha</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

Samarawickrama’s show and spewed a 
defamatory accusation—falsely claiming that 
Viraj had been involved in an extramarital 
affair, insinuating that this was the motive 
behind the attack.
The cruel innuendo spread like wildfire, and 
soon, Dilki was bombarded with prying 
inquiries. She was forced to defend her 
husband's honor when she should have 
been allowed to grieve. She reached out to 
Chamuditha to refute the claims, but the 
weight of her sorrow was too much—she could 
not bring herself to face the cameras.
A Grave Disturbance
In May 2024, a fresh nightmare unfolded. 
Dilki learned that Viraj’s remains had been 
disturbed—his upper body had been removed 
from the burial site, the very location 
designated by the Magistrate’s Court.
She filed an appeal, arguing that the missing 
remains would prevent a proper exhumation 
and re-examination. When questioned by 
the judge about what actions had been taken 
on this matter, the police countered coldly, 
claiming she had failed to secure "official 
permission" to bury him there in the first place.
Instead of investigating the desecration, they 
charged her with legal action.
A History of Violence Ignored
Dilki fought tirelessly—not just for justice for 
Viraj, but to expose the troubling past of one 
of the teenage attackers.
She presented evidence that one of them 
had previously been accused of bringing and 
distributing narcotics at school. He was known 
for violent outbursts, disrespecting teachers, 
and instigating fights.
These children have returned to school, 
seemingly without consequence. It is almost 
certain they will recount their actions to 
their classmates, potentially encouraging 
others toward disruptive behavior—and even 
violence against innocent people.
A Mockery of Justice
The day the teenagers were released on 
bail, Dilki was confronted with a scene that 
shattered her faith in the justice system. As 
she grappled with her profound grief, the 
atmosphere surrounding the teenagers' release 
was disturbingly celebratory. Their parents 
hosted a lavish party, and as Dilki exited 
the courthouse, they openly mocked her, 
displaying a disturbing lack of empathy and 
accountability. They jeered at the widow whose 
life had been torn apart. Where was justice? 
Where was humanity?
A Broken System, A Woman Left to Fight 
Alone
In Dilki’s eyes, the system is rotten to its 
core—a justice system riddled with inequity, a 
police force that silences victims, and a society 
that enables its children’s worst impulses.
Moreover, a serious concern looms: are child 
protection authorities truly safeguarding 
children and adolescents, or are they, in 
effect, shielding potential criminals from 
accountability?
The three perpetrators were shown kindness—
both by nature and by the system—securing 
for them bright futures and open prospects. In 
stark contrast, a grieving wife and an innocent 
infant were condemned to a life of uncertainty, 
shame, despair, and devastating isolation.
And as she wonders, with a sinking heart—
will justice ever be served?</p>
