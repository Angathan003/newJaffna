A few months after the assassination of 
Amirthalingam, the LTTE observed its first annual 
"Maaveerar Naal," or Great Heroes Day, on November 
27, 1989. This date was chosen by Prabhakaran 
to coincide with the anniversary of the death of 
Selvachandran Sathiyanathan, alias Lieutenant 
Shankar or Suresh, the first LTTE member to die in 
combat on November 27, 1982. Prabhakaran selected 
November 27 as Great Heroes Day to remember and 
honour all the fallen LTTE fighters.
The first Great Heroes Day was a sombre and 
restricted event, with the highlight being an emotional 
speech delivered by Prabhakaran to his followers in 
Nittakaikkulam, Mullaitivu, where he had established 
his temporary camp. The specific site of the speech 
was known as 'Punithabhoomi' or 'sacred land' in 
Tamil. This area, designated within the Nittakaikkulam 
base, was more than just the location for the speech; 
it was also where Prabhakaran, along with his loyal 
bodyguards, resided. Interestingly, the Base where 
Velupillai Prabhakaran lived was named 'Punitha 
Bhoomi' by Prabhakaran himself. 
During the first Great Heroes Day speech, an LTTE 
member who was present and later spoke to the Jaffna 
Monitor recalled that Prabhakaran acknowledged 
responsibility for the assassination of Amirthalingam. 
Interestingly, this part of his speech was subsequently 
edited from the video cassette circulated among 
the Tamil Diaspora. The source conveyed that 
Prabhakaran justified the assassination by stating that 
although Amirthalingam had initially supported the 
Tamil Eelam cause, he ultimately betrayed it. In his 
speech, Prabhakaran emphasized the seriousness of 
such a betrayal, declaring that anyone who betrays the 
Tamil Eelam cause, including himself, deserved to be 
killed.
Mahathaya's Tribute to Visu and 
Its Implications
Initially, the LTTE did not include the men who 
assassinated Amirthalingam and were subsequently 
killed by his bodyguards in their Maaveerar (Great 
Heroes) list. However, in early 1990, while peace 
talks with the Premadasa government were still 
ongoing, Mahathaya visited the home of Visu, an 
LTTE operative killed at Amirthalingam's house, in 
Nelliyadi to offer condolences to his parents. During 
this visit, credible sources suggest he was confronted 
by Visu's parents about their son's exclusion from 
the Maaveerar list. Emotionally driven, Mahathaya 
responded by publicly posting a condolence notice for 
Visu and posthumously promoting him to the rank of 
Major. This act was significant because, at the time, the 
LTTE was still vehemently denying any involvement 
in Amirthalingam's assassination. Therefore, 
Mahathaya's actions were interpreted as an implicit 
admission within the LTTE of their role in the killing. 
This incident was particularly notable as it suggested 
a divergence in approach between Mahathaya 
and Prabhakaran. Credible sources indicate that 
Mahathaya's decision to independently honor Visu 
without consulting Prabhakaran created uneasiness in 
Prabhakaran's mind. Known for his insecure nature, 
Prabhakaran likely viewed Mahathaya's independent 
action as a challenge to his authority and control 
within the organization.
