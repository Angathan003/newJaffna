Keeping Force and LTTE and violence in the south 
involving government forces and Janatha Vimukthi 
Peramuna militants. Both major political parties in the 
election pledged to revoke the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord 
and sought the withdrawal of Indian troops.
By this time, the LTTE, also cornered in the Sri Lankan 
jungles by the IPKF, sought a strategic pause. To 
achieve this, they initiated peace talks with President 
Premadasa's government, guided by the Tamil adage 
"an enemy's enemy is my friend." The primary goal of 
these talks was to facilitate the withdrawal of Indian 
forces from Sri Lanka. The Premadasa government, 
aiming to fulfill a key election promise of expelling 
Indian troops from Sri Lanka, initiated peace talks 
with the LTTE.
In an effort to lend credibility and a formal structure 
to their negotiations with the LTTE, the Premadasa 
government advised the LTTE to establish a political 
party. This move aimed to provide a legitimate 
platform for dialogue and facilitate a more structured 
approach to peace talks. Prabhakaran approved 
the formation of a political party for the LTTE, 
the People's Front of Liberation Tigers (PFLT), or 
Viduthalai Pulikal Makkal Munnani, appointing 
Mahathaya as its head and "Yogi" Yogaratham as its 
Secretary.
The peace talks garnered immense media coverage, 
both locally and internationally. The LTTE delegation, 
led by Mahathaya, was accommodated in Colombo 
as guests of the Sri Lankan government, staying in 
five-star hotels and participating in the negotiations. 
During this time, Mahathaya became the talk of the 
town, with his presence and activities extensively 
featured in TV, newspapers, and magazines, marking a 
peak in his public visibility.
Mahathaya's Omnipresence and 
Prabhakaran's Insecurity
Trustworthy sources from the LTTE told the Jaffna 
Monitor that the rising prominence and public 
acknowledgment of Mahathaya caused uneasiness 
for Prabhakaran, his Leader, who had a reputation 
for being insecure. A former prominent LTTE leader, 
who is currently living in exile and chose to remain 
anonymous, shared insightful reflections with the 
'Jaffna Monitor' magazine about the atmosphere 
during Mahathaya's peak popularity. He described a 
time when Mahathaya's presence was ubiquitous in the 
media: "If you woke up and read the newspaper, there 
was Mahathaya; if you turned on your radio, there 
was Mahathaya. His name was virtually everywhere." 
This omnipresence in the media made Mahathaya a 
household name, significantly elevating his profile. The 
former Leader further argued that such widespread 
recognition could easily lead to feelings of insecurity in 
others, especially in a person like Prabhakaran, known 
for his inherent insecurities. 
The LTTE's Strategic Blunder: 
Mahathaya's Role in the 
Amirthalingam Assassination
On July 13, 1989, amidst ongoing peace talks between 
an official LTTE delegation and President Ranasinghe 
Premadasa's government in Colombo, Appapillai 
Amirthalingam, the Leader of the Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF), and former TULF Jaffna MP 
Vettivelu Yogeswaran were assassinated on Colombo's 
Bullers Road. The assailants, Rasiah Aravindarajah 
(Visu), Peter Aloysius Leon (Vigna), and Sivakumar 
(Arivu), active members of the LTTE, were known as 
 Appapillai Amirthalingam

Mahathaya's men and were linked directly to him, who 
was at the time leading the LTTE's peace negotiations. 
These killings, carried out under the orders of LTTE 
leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, resulted in the assassins 
being gunned down by Amirthalingam's security 
officer, Nissanka Thibbotumunuwa. Despite initial 
denials by the LTTE's political wing and its General 
Secretary, Yogaratnam Yogi, the involvement of the 
LTTE, and particularly Mahathaya's faction, in these 
assassinations was widely recognized and condemned.
The assassination, while achieving its immediate 
goal, is considered a significant tactical and strategic 
blunder by the LTTE, a view echoed not only by 
external observers but also by former LTTE cadres, as 
told to us (Jaffna Monitor). Several reasons contribute 
to this perception of failure. One crucial aspect was the 
loss of two valuable LTTE members, Visu and Vigna. 
Former LTTE leaders, now living in exile and speaking 
anonymously with the Jaffna Monitor, provided insight 
into this view. They noted that before Amirthalingam's 
assassination, the LTTE had primarily conducted a 
single major suicide attack on July 5, 1987, against 
the Sri Lankan army at Nelliady Madhya Maha 
Vidyalayam, executed by Vallipuram Vasanthan, also 
known as Captain Miller, the first Black Tiger. The 
second suicide attack attributed to the LTTE was the 
assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi on May 21, 1991, although the LTTE never 
officially claimed the attack or included the assassin, 
Thanu, in their list of Great Heroes (Maveerar). These 
ex-leaders criticized the planning and execution 
of Amirthalingam's assassination, orchestrated by 
Mahathaya's group, likening it to an unplanned suicide

attack. They argued that Amirthalingam, a political 
figure, and not a military target, could have been 
assassinated in numerous other ways that wouldn't 
have resulted in the loss of key LTTE operatives. 
Instead, they described the approach taken – attacking 
Amirthalingam in his own home, surrounded by 
his loyal bodyguards – as tactically unsound and 
counterproductive, illustrating a significant lapse in 
strategic judgment by the Mahathaya's team. This 
decision reflected a considerable lapse in strategic 
judgment on Mahathaya's part and exposed a 
significant deficiency in planning and military prowess 
within his team. 
This incident significantly impacted the LTTE's public 
perception and image. The operation inadvertently 
revealed the LTTE's direct involvement despite their 
initial denials. Historically, the LTTE had frequently 
denied involvement in specific assassinations, often 
utilizing its propaganda tools to deflect responsibility 
and preserve its public image. However, the bodies 
of LTTE members Visu, Vigna, and Arivu served as 
undeniable evidence of the LTTE's involvement. This 
event, almost akin to an unintended exhibition, starkly 
exposed the reality of the LTTE's tactics, undermining 
their attempts to portray themselves as a peace-loving 
organization amid ongoing negotiations with the Sri 
Lankan government.
The assassination also highlighted the LTTE's 
contradictory actions. On one hand, they were 
engaged in peace talks, while on the other, they 
were executing high-profile assassinations. This 
inconsistency raised doubts about their true intentions 
and commitment to peace, suggesting a deceptive 
strategy of feigning peace negotiations while 
continuing to engage in acts of violence.
Moreover, this incident drew strong international 
criticism and led to increased isolation for the LTTE. 
The assassination of a prominent political leader 
during peace negotiations was perceived as a direct 
attack on, and a significant setback to, the peace efforts 
in Sri Lanka. The global community condemned this 
act, viewing it as an aggressive move that significantly 
hampered the prospects of resolving the conflict in the 
country.
While there are individuals loyal to both 
Amirthalingam and Prabhakaran who contend 
that Amirthalingam's murder was orchestrated and 
executed by Mahathaya independently, without the 
consent of LTTE supremo Prabhakaran, former senior 
leaders of the LTTE disagree with this assertion. 
In conversations with the Jaffna Monitor, these ex-
leaders have described such a claim as absurd. They 
argue that given the hierarchical structure of the 
LTTE, it would have been impossible for Mahathaya 
to plan and carry out a high-profile assassination like 
that of Amirthalingam without direct orders from 
Prabhakaran. The organizational framework of the 
LTTE was such that operations, especially those of 
significant magnitude and impact, required approval 
and directives from the top leadership. 
Credible sources indicate that Prabhakaran 
was angered by the loss of three guards and the 
public exposure of the LTTE's involvement in the 
assassination. Despite this, he remained largely 
unaffected by the criticism directed towards him and 
the organization.
