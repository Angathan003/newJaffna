Vijitharan
Swasthika Arulingam
S
wastika Arulingam, a human rights activist and 
lawyer, encountered significant opposition at the 
University of Jaffna, thwarting her from engaging 
in a planned event there. The root of this discord was her 
critique of the LTTE, which she has publicly labelled as a 
fascist entity.
During the ceasefire period from 2000 to 2006, the 
University of Jaffna served as a de facto epicentre for 
LTTE sympathizers, perpetuating the group’s ideological 
influence. Selvarajah Kajendran, once the student union 
leader and now a member of parliament for the Tamil 
National People’s Front, had been a staunch advocate 
for the LTTE. His ascent to student leadership and his 
continued political trajectory, commencing with his MP 
role for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in 2004 amid 
accusations of electoral improprieties, reflect the deep 
intertwining of LTTE politics within the university’s 
governance.
The experience of Swasthika Arulingam highlights a 
broader issue: while individual perspectives on her actions 
and intentions may differ, her fundamental right to 
express her opinions freely and without fear or obstruction 
remains indisputable. This right carries immense weight 
given the history of the University of Jaffna, where, in 
the past, students paid the ultimate price for challenging 
the LTTE’s oppressive ideology in pursuit of intellectual 
liberty. Despite the LTTE’s military defeat, the continued 
influence of its ideology within the university demonstrates 
the complexities involved in eradicating its entrenched 
academic and cultural foothold. The situation at the 
university is emblematic of the difficulties faced by 
advocates of free expression and democratic principles in 
environments that have long been under the shadow of 
tyranny.
Remembering Vijitharan: A Chapter of Courage and 
Consequence
The years 1985 and 1986 marked a defining period in 
Jaffna’s history. During this era, Tamil militant groups, 
despite their ideological differences, united to defend the 
city of Jaffna against the Sri Lankan army’s incursion. 
However, the triumph was fleeting as the LTTE decimated 
TELO, another militant faction. Militants from the Eastern 
Province, unfamiliar with Jaffna’s labyrinthine streets, were 
tragically ensnared and massacred. This starkly contrasted 
with the local TELO fighters who, knowing the terrain, 
often escaped. Some narratives suggest this was not mere

University and Jaffna school students unite in protest against the LTTE following the abduction of Jaffna University student Vijitharan.</p>

happenstance but an intentional purge by 
the LTTE, fueled by a sense of regional 
supremacy, which led to mercilessly 
targeting Eastern militants while sparing 
their northern counterparts with warnings. 
The violence against the Eastern militants 
culminated in their brutal executions and 
the desecration of their bodies.
During tumultuous times, students from 
the Highlands and Eastern Provinces at 
Jaffna University were subjected to harsh 
persecution by the LTTE, often without 
proper investigation, driven by mere 
suspicion. Rumors circulated that some 
of this persecution was due to personal 
vendettas. One such rumor involved the LTTE’s Jaffna 
regional commander, Kittu, who reportedly took retaliatory 
actions because university students ragged someone 
believed to be his girlfriend, Cynthia. This situation put 
the safety of students from the affected regions in jeopardy, 
prompting them to consider transferring to the relatively 
safer southern campuses.
Amidst the turmoil, there arose a resolute belief that 
students from the Highlands and Eastern Provinces should 
not be deprived of their academic opportunities in Jaffna. 
Advocates voiced that these students had an inalienable 
right to education and should be able to progress in their 
studies at Jaffna University without the shadow of fear 
looming over them.
Amid the LTTE’s pervasive intimidation, the Jaffna 
University student council often failed to stand up for these 
vulnerable students. It was during this critical time that 
Arunagirinathan Vijitharan, a resolute commerce student 
from Batticaloa, emerged as a leader, rallying his peers and 
leading protests, often circumventing the passive official 
student council.
The firm resolve of Vijitharan to champion 
advocacy and resist oppression came at 
a steep, personal cost. One day, without 
warning, he vanished as if into thin air, 
an event that sent shockwaves through 
his community. Although no one 
officially claimed responsibility for his 
disappearance, it was an open secret that 
the LTTE’s high-ranking leaders were 
behind this grim act. “Colonel” Kittu, the 
military overseer, alongside Thileepan, 
the LTTE’s political leader in Jaffna at 
the time, were both rumoured to have 
played a part in orchestrating his sudden 
abduction. As a vocal advocate for student 
rights, Vijitharan was a thorn in the side 
of those who wished to silence dissent. His subsequent 
disappearance remains one of the many unsolved mysteries 
of the conflict.
The abduction triggered one of the last significant public 
protests against the LTTE by the Tamil community. This 
series of demonstrations, marches, and pickets represented 
a peak of public frustration with the LTTE’s autocratic 
actions, which had long suppressed democratic processes 
and perpetrated abductions and assassinations. Students 
from schools joined the outcry, signalling a united front 
against not only the LTTE but also other militant groups 
involved in the struggle for Eelam. The protests transcended 
Vijitharan’s case, representing a broader indictment of 
years of societal transgressions that had eroded democratic 
freedoms.
At Jaffna University, students, led by Vimaleswaran, 
embarked on a hunger strike, resolved to continue until 
their demands were met or until death. This act of defiance, 
however, ended in tragedy when Vimaleswaran was brutally 
killed by the LTTE.</p>
<p>Today, the atmosphere at Jaffna University has shifted. 
Many current students, perhaps oblivious to their 
institution’s turbulent past, have taken actions like 
preventing Swastika Arulingam from attending an event. 
Ironically, their forerunners once courageously confronted 
the LTTE’s tyranny and suffered greatly for it. The current 
generation might be uninformed or possibly wishes 
to distance themselves from such distressing histories. 
Regrettably, the university itself appears to have neglected 
to honor the memory of brave individuals like Vijitharan, 
Vimaleswaran, and lecturer Rajini Thiranagama, whose 
voices were silenced by the LTTE. This serves as a somber 
reminder of the critical importance of remembering our 
past to honor the sacrifices made by those who stood for 
liberty and justice.
