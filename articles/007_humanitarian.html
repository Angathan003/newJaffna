N
iththilan (name changed), a former 
courageous United Nations worker, 
witnessed the harrowing scenes of Sri Lanka's 
final war in 2009. Among the few living 
who can testify to the devastating atrocities 
committed by both the Sri Lankan government 
and the LTTE, he played a crucial role in the 
conflict's final stages. In September 2008, 
after the directive for the evacuation of UN 
and international humanitarian organizations 
from LTTE-controlled territories, Niththilan 
was appointed as the officer in charge of 
all UN operations in the region. He led the 
UN mission within LTTE-controlled areas, 
directing local staff in the absence of his 
international colleagues. Currently residing in 
Europe, Niththilan has decided to break his 
silence and share his experiences with 'Jaffna 
Monitor' under the condition of anonymity.
You have repeatedly mentioned that 
former LTTE heavyweight Elilan was 
a brutal child abductor and a war 
criminal. Could you elaborate on this?
In early March 2009, as the Sri Lankan 
civil war reached its devastating climax, 
thousands who had fled from different parts 
of Vanni, including Mannar, sought refuge 
in the northern region's last remnants of 
LTTE-controlled territory. These displaced 
people settled in the narrow coastal strip

encompassing Puthumathalan, Pokkanai, 
Valaignarmadam, and Mullivaikkal. This 
shrinking enclave, measuring a mere 400 
meters in width and extending 5-6 kilometers 
in length, became the final bastion of Tamil 
Eelam.
In Valaignarmadam, a Catholic church became 
a sanctuary during the final days of the Sri 
Lankan civil war. Over 400 families, seeking 
refuge from the chaos, gathered within the 
church compound, which welcomed people of 
all religions. The parents, desperate to protect 
their children from the brutal abduction teams 
of the LTTE, hid them within the Church's 
confines. Armed only with sticks and poles, 
they guarded the Church, determined to keep 
the LTTE out.
Displaced Catholic clergy from the vast Vanni 
region, including priests and nuns, also found 
shelter on the premises connected to the 
Church. The parents believed the sanctity of 
the Church would shield their children, naively 
trusting that the LTTE would not violate the 
holy grounds. They stood vigilant, refusing 
entry to anyone who might threaten their 
children's safety, ready to defend them with 
whatever means they had.
The Church challenged the LTTE's 
authoritarianism. The LTTE, who desired 
absolute power, had never allowed anyone 
to question them.  Throughout their decades 
of rule, they made it clear that no one could 
raise a voice against them. However, this half-
acre church compound defied their authority. 
Parents, defying LTTE orders, were hiding 
their children there and went a step further by 
guarding the church premises from the LTTE's 
brutal abduction teams with sticks and poles.
Near the Church stood the temporary office of 
the Mullaitivu Government Agent, Parthiban. 
Parthiban, who is now in Switzerland, often 
received visits from my colleagues and me, 
especially when United Nations food supplies 
arrived. We would hand them over to him first, 
ensuring that the aid reached those in need.
One fateful day, I went to discuss arrangements 
for an expected ship arrival in 2-3 days.  I was 
engulfed by a wave of chaos as I approached 
his office. The desperate cries of youths echoed 
through the air, a heart-wrenching sound that 
pierced my soul. I saw 4 to 5 buses parked 
there, an unusual and alarming sight. My heart 
sank as the horrifying realization dawned 
upon me—this was an abduction operation. 
The LTTE had breached the sanctity of the 
Church, intent on tearing away the children 
and youth sheltered there.
When I arrived, the LTTE, heavily armed 
and clad in protective gear, had brought 
the majority of their remaining forces from 
Vanni. They resembled a full-scale military 
invasion, but tragically, their target was not an 
enemy force but their own innocent youths. 
The leader of this brutal abduction team was 
Ezhilan.
I recognized Ezhilan immediately. We were 
from the same Divisional Secretariat (DS) 
division in Jaffna. He was a well-known 
volleyball player who represented the 
Avarangal Central Sports Club. I had known 
him only as a peaceful and good-hearted 
young man. But now, Ezhilan looked like an 
evil child abductor, ready for full combat and 
willing to go to any lengths to abduct children. 
He wore body armor and protective gear, 
carrying two guns: a pistol in his hand and an 
AK-47 slung over his shoulder. He had come 
to abduct children as if he were going to war.
When I approached him, Ezhilan saw me and 
seemed to feel ashamed. He turned his face</p>

and stepped aside, unable to meet my eyes.
I heard horrifying sounds as the LTTE 
mercilessly beat the parents who were 
desperately trying to protect their children. 
The anguished cries of the parents, mixed 
with the sickening thud of blows landing, 
created a cacophony of terror. Blood ran 
through the corridors, staining the sacred 
ground of the Church. In their brutal assault, 
the LTTE showed no regard for the sanctity 
of the place; a few statues of Jesus and Mary 
were vandalized. The once peaceful Church 
was transformed into a scene of chaos and 
violence. Amidst this devastation, the LTTE 
forcibly abducted the innocent children, 
dragging them away from the arms of their 
pleading parents. 
The desperate parents fought back as best 
they could, but they were no match for the 
heavily armed militants. The LTTE didn't 
shoot anyone but fired into the air and savagely 
beat the parents, behaving like wild animals 
and treating the parents no better. The LTTE's 
brutality knew no bounds as they ruthlessly 
overpowered the defenseless families.
On that dreadful day, the LTTE abducted 
nearly 400 children from the church premises. 
These children, who sought refuge in the 
sacred space, were torn from their families' 
arms and thrust into the clutches of a losing 
war. It's important to remember that, at that 
time, the LTTE's territory had shrunk to a 
mere few kilometers. The end was clearly in 
sight, and any sane person would understand 
the imminent total annihilation of the LTTE. 
Yet, the LTTE forcibly abducted children for a 
war they were destined to lose. Knowing their 
days were numbered, the LTTE leadership, 
instead of facing their inevitable defeat with 
dignity, chose to drag innocent lives into 
their doomed struggle to save themselves. 
In a horrifying act of self-preservation, they 
sacrificed innocent children, displaying 
a monstrous contempt for humanity and 
decency.
When I was in Vanni, I always wore the UN 
uniform to identify myself as a UN worker, 
carrying a UN radio with an antenna and a</p>

satellite telephone. On that horrific day, as 
the LTTE herded the children onto the buses, 
the children saw me and recognized me from 
my clothes. The sight of my familiar uniform 
sparked a desperate glimmer of hope in their 
eyes. They began shouting and crying out 
for help, their voices filled with terror and 
desperation. "Anna, please save us, save us," 
they cried. Their pleas still echo in my mind to 
this day.
I stood there, paralyzed by a mixture of 
helplessness, rage, and despair, unable to do 
anything to stop the abduction. The sight 
of those children, torn from their families 
and thrust into a nightmare, was more than 
I could bear. By my estimation, at least 400 
children were abducted by Ezhilan from 
the Valaignarmadam church that day alone. 
Overall, he abducted thousands of children 
and sent them forcefully into the jaws of the 
multibarrel shells.
Today, Ezhilan's wife, Ananthi Sasitharan, is a 
prominent advocate for the disappeared, but 
her husband bears the responsibility for the 
disappearance of those 400 children on that 
single day. The weight of those lost children, 
their stolen futures, and the endless grief of 
their families are a burden that Ezhilan and his 
wife must carry forever.
Ezhilan, who surrendered to the army in the 
final battle, remains on the missing persons 
list. Since the end of the war, Ananthi, 
who has been searching for her husband, 
has appeared in numerous international 
forums, emphasizing the tragedy of missing 
persons. She does not, however, speak out 
about her husband's forcible abduction and 
disappearance of minor children. I would 
salute and support her if she accepted the fact 
that her husband was a brutal child abductor 
responsible for the kidnapping of hundreds 
of children and fought for those made to 
disappear by her husband.
You mentioned that all the Catholic 
clergy in the Vanni region were in that 
Church at the time of the abduction. 
Why didn't they intervene and stop the 
brutal abduction?
It's true that while these atrocities were 
happening, all the fathers and sisters of the 
Vanni region who were present there were 
hiding. No one came out to speak against the 
brutal actions of the LTTE. None of the clergy 
stepped forward to tell the LTTE not to do this 
inside the Church, not to abduct children, or 
not to vandalize the statues. Instead, they were 
hiding inside the Church, remaining silent in 
the face of such brutality.
Why didn't you intervene?
In a sense, I was paralyzed with fear. Had I 
intervened, the LTTE would have definitely 
killed me on the spot.
What happened to those 400 children?
I believe the vast majority of those abducted 
were killed on the battlefield. Almost all of 
them were forced to fight on the front lines 
with only a few days of training. How can 
one imagine that children, with minimal 
preparation and without the will to fight, could 
stand on the front lines with guns, facing 
sophisticated military shells and gunfire?
We heard that you were the one who 
proposed the no-fire zone. Can you tell 
us about it?</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

Yes, I proposed the no-fire zone during 
the intense fighting in Kilinochchi in mid-
December 2008. As the war intensified, the 
area from Kandavalai Junction to Theravil 
Junction became densely populated with 
displaced people. Most of the displaced chose 
to settle in Tharmapuram, Visuvamadu, and 
nearby places.
From Tharmapuram junction to Visuvamadu 
junction, a makeshift town emerged, created by 
the displaced population. Along Tharmapuram 
Road, shop signs bore the names of other cities 
and villages from the Vanni region, such as 
Mangulam, Murigandi, and Kilinochchi. The 
LTTE offices and the remaining NGOs were 
also situated in this area.
During the height of the conflict, the 
district secretariat moved to Tharmapuram. 
In one of our coordination meetings, I 
proposed establishing a no-fire zone from 
Kandavalai junction to Theravil Pond, a 
stretch spanning 6 kilometers. Despite initial 
scepticism, no one objected to my plan. I 
quickly drafted a one-page proposal and 
sent it to the UN coordinator for Sri Lanka. I 
secured the support of the GA of Mullaitivu, 
Vethanayagam, the director of education, and 
several other key officials. 
Within 30 minutes, I received a positive 
response from my office.
I submitted this proposal in December 
2008, but the government did not respond 
immediately. By January 2009, on Thai Pongal 
day, the Visuvamadu and Tharmapuram 
areas were displaced as the army captured 
Kandavalai.

On January 20th, I received a late-night call 
from my superior at the UN. "Your proposal 
has been approved by the government of 
Sri Lanka," she said. "The government has 
agreed to a no-fire zone, but the boundaries 
are different from what you proposed. The 
government announced boundaries from 
Theravil Kulam to Suthanthira Puram 
junction." 
Although these boundaries differed from my 
original proposal, I was elated because people, 
including us (UN workers), had already moved 
to that area.
Overjoyed, I announced the news to the 
general public. The relief and happiness were 
palpable; people believed they could finally 
sleep peacefully. Many came to my temporary 
shelter to confirm the news. I felt immense 
pride and joy, knowing my proposal had 
made a difference and that I could finally do 
something meaningful for my people. 
However, at that time, I did not understand 
the government's true intention behind 
announcing the no-fire zone.
What happened after the 
establishment of the no-fire zone?
The next day, all radio channels, including 
Ilankai Vanoli (Sri Lankan Radio), repeatedly 
announced the establishment of a no-fire zone. 
Civilians believed wholeheartedly that this 
would alleviate their suffering and reduce the 
deaths of non-combatants, allowing them to 
finally sleep peacefully without the threat of 
indiscriminate shelling. People from all areas 
flocked to the no-fire zone, spreading out</p>

tarpaulins and living there without building 
bunkers for safety.
Despite the announcement, the LTTE 
continued to operate within the no-fire zone 
as usual, with camps and offices already 
established before the declaration. Initially, 
the LTTE refrained from attacking the army 
from within the zone. However, the LTTE's 
brutal child abduction teams continued their 
forced conscription activities even within the 
designated no-fire area.
What were the conditions and 
challenges faced within the no-fire 
zone?
Though the Sri Lankan government had 
proclaimed the no-fire zone, the specific 
conditions and limitations were not 
communicated to the UN. We eagerly awaited 
this information, as the zone was established 
at the UN's request. Unfortunately, the UN did 
not have an official agreement or discussions 
about the no-fire zone with the Sri Lankan 
government, which was a significant oversight 
on our part. Ideally, both parties in a conflict 
should refrain from using or carrying weapons 
in a no-fire zone. However, this was not the 
case here, as the LTTE maintained weapons, 
camps, and offices inside the zone, and forced 
conscription continued unabated.
We established our UN hub in a playground 
at the Suthanthirapuram junction within the 
no-fire zone. In this expansive area, spanning 
5-6 acres, we established our UN hub and 
a civilian distribution point for the goods 
brought by the UN convoy. At that time, the

last UN food convoy arrived with around 50 
trucks loaded with supplies. Six international 
staff members entered the war zone, but four 
left. Two stayed: Karun Khan, a Bangladeshi 
national working in the UN Department of 
Security, and Peter, a UN operations specialist, 
who remained with the intention of evacuating 
the UN staff. They took the risk and stayed 
with us at the UN hub. 
In the UN hub, we constructed a bunker with 
the help of locals for the safety of our two 
international staff. We shared the GPS location 
of the UN hub with the army through our 
Vavuniya office. Although it was a no-fire zone, 
we deemed it necessary to share our location 
for added security.
What happened after the 
announcement of the no-fire zone?
About a week after the announcement, there 
were no incidents or shelling within the no-fire 
zone. However, one night, around 2 o'clock, 
the army began shelling the no-fire zone. I can 
confirm that all the shelling was targeted solely 
at the no-fire zone because the Sri Lankan 
government and army were fully aware of its 
boundaries and our UN hub's GPS location.
The initial calm was shattered by the sudden 
and intense bombardment. Shells rained down 
on the no-fire zone and our UN hub, creating 
chaos and panic. The shelling was so intense 
that it prevented us from reaching the safety 
of our bunkers. Instead, we were forced to 
hide under and near the UN lorries, seeking 
any cover we could find. Some staff members 
managed to reach the bunkers, but many of us 
were caught in the open, exposed to the deadly 
barrage.
The civilians in the no-fire zone had taken 
no precautions, fully trusting the Sri Lankan 
government's announcement. They hadn't 
dug a single bunker, believing that the no-fire 
zone would keep them safe. The trust placed 
in the government's word proved fatal. On the 
first day of the attack, around 16 civilians died 
within the UN hub alone. The situation was 
even more dire in other areas of the no-fire 
zone.
Based on my estimation, approximately 150 
people were killed during the first day of 
shelling. The aftermath was devastating. Bodies 
lay scattered across the area, the sounds of 
weeping and cries for help echoing through 
the night. The once hopeful and relatively 
safe haven had turned into a scene of horror 
and despair. The trust the civilians had placed 
in the no-fire zone was brutally betrayed, 
leading to a tragic loss of innocent lives. The 
experience left us all shaken, with the haunting 
realization that the supposed safe zone had 
become a deadly trap for those seeking refuge.
What was the impact on the UN staff 
and subsequent events?
 Fortunately, no UN staff died during the 
initial shelling, but a few were injured. Our 
UN vehicles were littered with human remains, 
a grim reminder of the attack's brutality. 
This was a clear violation and a war crime 
committed by the Sri Lankan government. We 
repeatedly communicated with them, pleading 
for the shelling to stop. However, the next day, 
the army shelled the no-fire zone again.
On the second day, the situation escalated 
further. The LTTE, now desperate and 
enraged, retaliated from within the no-fire 
zone. This only intensified the conflict. The 
army's shelling became even more relentless. 
That day, around 350 people died in the no-fire</p>

zone. The scenes were horrifying, with civilians 
caught in the crossfire, unable to escape the 
relentless bombardment.
In total, more than 500 people were killed by 
the indiscriminate shelling over the two days. 
Were those attacks on the no-fire zone 
intentional?
Absolutely, yes. There were deliberate and 
intense attacks on the no-fire zone targeting 
civilians.
What was the real motive of the Sri 
Lankan government to attack the no-
fire zone?
I believe the then-government sought revenge 
against Tamil civilians who had supported the 
LTTE, aiming to teach them a brutal lesson. 
It wasn't just retaliation; it was a calculated 
strategy to ensure no group like the LTTE 
would ever rise again. By inflicting severe 
punishment on the general public who had 
long supported the LTTE, they aimed to crush 
any future support for such movements.
The government blatantly disregarded the rules 
of war, knowing full well that 90 percent of the 
population in the no-fire zone were civilians. 
Yet, they shelled the area mercilessly. It was 
a deliberate, heartless assault on the general 
public meant to send a clear, chilling message. 
The sheer brutality was designed to break the 
spirit of any potential resistance, to instill a 
deep, paralyzing fear.
