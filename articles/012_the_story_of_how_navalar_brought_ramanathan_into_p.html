T
he year 1879 is filled with significant 
historical events, especially in Tamil 
history. In the three preceding years, a cholera 
epidemic engulfed Jaffna, resulting in the 
deaths of approximately 7,000 people. As a 
result of the anti-cholera relief efforts, many 
prominent Tamils united regardless of caste 
or religion. By 1879, the cholera epidemic had 
ended, and the situation returned to normal. 
This year marks the death of Arumuka 
Navalar and Sir Muthucoomaraswamy. It was 
also the year Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan

entered politics. Ramanathan, who was raised 
under the care of his maternal uncle, Sir 
Muthucoomaraswamy, began his political 
career during this significant year.
On May 4, 1879, Sir Muthucoomaraswamy 
passed away. From 1862 until his death, 
he served as a member of the Legislative 
Council. His death created a vacancy in 
the Legislative Council. In the contest for 
his vacant seat, the Catholic candidate 
Christopher Britto received the support of 
Thirumeniar Venkatasamlapillai, the great-
grandfather of LTTE supremo Prabhakaran. 
Venkatasalampillai believed that appointing 
Britto, a Catholic known for his long 
experience in public service, his prominence 
as a social worker, district judge, and Queen's 
Counsel, through the Governor's nomination 
would avoid religious discrimination among 
Sri Lankan Tamils and promote unity and 
service among the people.
However, in that contest, due to the intense 
campaigning by Arumuka Navalar, who 
promoted the slogan "Saiva Vellalar," 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan, a high-caste 
Vellalar, was appointed to the position by the 
Governor. Navalar completed this task and 
passed away a few months later, on December 
5, 1879.
In reality, Ramanathan was not well-known 
in the North at that time. Coomaraswamy's 
family was based in Colombo, and Britto 
was more well-known than Ramanathan. 
The political contest between Britto and 
Ramanathan is very significant in history. 
Even today, whenever Ramanathan's entry into 
politics is mentioned, it is often summarized as 
"Navalar brought him into politics." However, 
we need to view this historical event as part 
of the Jaffna-Saiva-Vellalar dynamic that was 
occurring behind the scenes.
Christopher Brito
Christopher Brito's father, Philip Brito, was 
from Puttalam and was known as a prominent 
Mudaliyar and a government registrar. Brito 
received his education at Colombo Academy, 
which is known today as Royal College. He 
was the first Sri Lankan to graduate from the 
University of Calcutta.
Subsequently, he served as a professor at Agra 
University. Upon returning to Sri Lanka, 
he worked as a professor of mathematics at 
Colombo Academy, where he had studied. 
In 1867, he began practicing as a barrister 
in the Supreme Court and later served as a 
judge in the districts of Batticaloa, Jaffna, 
and Colombo. Brito was a well-known figure, 
influential as a Queen's Counsel. From January 
to December 1872, he was a member of the 
Colombo Municipal Council.1 He also served 
as the president of the Bar Association.2 Brito 
was proficient in Tamil, Sinhala, English, Latin, 
Greek, Sanskrit, and Pali.
He also served as the president of the Catholic 
Union of Ceylon.3 According to the Ferguson 
Directory (1905-1906), he was a plantation 
owner as well.4

Christopher Brito's Contribution to 
Tamil Cultural Studies
While the Mahavamsa is celebrated by the 
Sinhalese as the history of Sri Lanka, it can 
be said to be the history of the Sinhalese 
Buddhists. Similarly, the works that are still 
used today to understand the history of 
the Jaffna Tamils include "Kailaya Malai," 
"Vaiya Padal," "Pararajasekaran Ula," "Raja 
Murai," and "Yalpana Vaipava Malai." Of 
these, the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai" was first 
written in 17365 by Mayilvaganapulavar at 
the request by the Dutch Governorship of 
Jan Maccara. However, it was first printed 
only in 1884.6 Based on this book, in 1928, 
Swami Gnanapragasar published a work titled 
"Yalpana Vaipava Vimarsanam – Tamilarasar 
Uham." In his publication, he addresses the 
inconsistencies he found in the "Yalpana 
Vaipava Malai."7 His important critical essay, 
"Sources of the Yalpana Vaipava Malai," was 
5  Later, the " yalpana Vaibhava Malai" went to the 
British Library and copied it and it was published by 
Mudaliar Kula Sabanathan to re-publish it.   Although 
Brito's book mentions that the original work was 
published by Mayilvahana Pulavar in 1736, Kula Sa-
panathan's book "Yaazhpaana Vaibhava Maalai"  may 
have been written about 50  years before that, espe-
cially examining the discrepancies in the information 
about the life of the Mayilvahana poet  and examining 
the discrepancies in the information about the life of 
the Mayilvagana pulavar from the middle of the 18th 
century to the 19th centuryIt is logically argued that it 
must have existed until the beginning of the th cen-
tury. (Mudaliar Kula Sabanathan - YalpanaVaibhava 
Malai - "Eelakesari" edited by Mr.N.Ponniah, Principal 
- 1949)

published in English under the title "Revd. 
S. Gnana Prakasar - Sources of the Yalpana 
Vaipava Malai'.8
One and a half centuries after the original 
book was written, Brito first translated it 
from Tamil to English. This translation was 
published in 1879. Interestingly, this means 
that the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai" was available 
in English even before it was printed in Tamil.9 
Today, Brito's English translation remains an 
essential document for studying the history 
of Jaffna. It is not merely a translation but 
includes many annotations, footnotes, and 
explanations, showcasing Brito's research 
expertise. When exploring Brito's background, 
it is evident that he had a deep and inquisitive

knowledge of history. This is particularly 
apparent in the records of the Ceylon Branch 
of the Royal Asiatic Society, where he made 
numerous contributions to history, literature, 
and politics.
For this translation, he compared many 
other historical texts. During his research, 
he noted that "the book contains individuals, 
events, and times in a confusing manner." 
10Additionally, it seems that regional and caste 
superiority sentiments are interwoven in his 
liberal-minded translation, particularly evident 
in the way he describes the "Boothathampi" 
matter, as observed by John H. Martyn.11 John 
Martyn has extensively analyzed the various 
complexities in both the compilation of the 
"Yalpana Vaipava Malai" and Brito's translation 
in his book.
John Martyn mentions that the second 
edition of the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai" was 
published in 1882 by Reverend S. John of 
the American Mission in Jaffna. However, 
the book he published was actually titled 
"Yalpana Chariththiram or the History of 
Jaffna – S. John." This book was based on the 
"Yalpana Vaipava Malai" but included some 
modifications. Notably, there are differences 
in the accounts of Kailaya Vanniyan and his 
cousin Boothathampi traveling to Colombo 
and the events that took place there.
In another instance, Martyn clarifies that Brito 
did not write a separate "History of Jaffna." 
Instead, Brito translated the "Yalpana Vaipava 
Malai" and added some annotations. Martyn 
emphasizes that if Brito had indeed written a 
separate historical work, he would not have 
titled it "History of Jaffna."

cal, Biographical - John H.Martyn - Asian Educational 
Services, New Delhi, India - 1923
Another historically significant book translated 
by Brito is the "Mukkuvar Law," published in 
1876, even before the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai." 
Brito undertook this translation while serving 
as Batticaloa's district judge, recognizing this 
work's importance. A reference indicates that 
he delivered a lecture titled "The Political 
Situation of Ceylon a Hundred Years Ago," 
which was later published as an article. 
However, the location or the text of this article 
remains unknown.12
Brito's deep involvement in scholarly activities 
is evident from his membership in the Royal 
Asiatic Society – Ceylon Branch (e.g., the 1865 
membership list) and his collaboration on 
various research projects with several English 
scholars, including H.C.P. Bell.
Alongside the renowned archaeologist H.C.P. 
Bell, Brito submitted a research paper titled 
"The Tamilian Problem." It is noted that only 
after Brito did figures such as Ramanathan and 
Arunachalam begin to take part in the Royal 
Asiatic Society. Later, Brito, Ramanathan, 
and Arunachalam were active members 
simultaneously, participating in meetings 
and making significant decisions together. In 
a meeting held at the Colombo Museum on 
May 16, 1895, Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy 
chaired the session. In the same meeting, 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan expressed his 
views on a discussion about "Purananuru," 
while Brito discussed obtaining documents 
for debates on "Silappathikaram" and King 
Gajaba's Indian expedition.13
Additionally, Brito published a book titled 
"Life of Pope Pius IX – Jaffna" in 1892, as 
noted in the British Library's catalog of Tamil 
12 “BOOKS ON CEYLON” - Ceylon Antiquary And 
Literary Register Vol.6 (1921-1922) by Office Of The 
Times Of Ceylon – 1921 (p.48)

books.14 The role of prominent Tamil Christian 
scholars of that era, such as Kasi Chetty, Henry 
Martyn, John, Daniel Samuel, and Christopher 
Brito, in rediscovering and disseminating the 
history of Jaffna cannot be overlooked. While 
their contributions may not have received due 
recognition within the Tamil community, they 
are highly acknowledged outside of it. Brito's 
contribution to Tamil cultural studies should 
be viewed in this broader context.
Kasi Chetty, Brito, and Muthukrishna were 
known as "Colombo Chetties"15 and, as noted 
by Patrick Peebles, they were Protestant 
migrants from South India.16 However, 
Peebles' book creates potential confusion by 
mentioning Christopher Brito, who translated 
the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai," in one paragraph 
and then discussing these Colombo Chetties in 
the next, implying that the two Britos might be 
the same person.
At the same time, there was another individual 
named Philip R. Britto Babapulle, a well-
known physician and relative of Kasi Chetty, 
who also wrote books. There is even a 
street named "Dr Britto Babapulle Place" in 
Colombo's Grandpass area in his honor. He 
too came from a Chetty background.

British museum, compiled by L. D. Barnett - 1909
15 We can see that the Chetties functioned as a sepa-
rate caste in Sri Lanka. There are ample  references 
to the existence of a dominant caste on a par with 
the Vellalars. The petition,  dated 02.09.1830  dated 
Mariarasa of Jaffna, referred to the Supreme Court the 
evidence of the application filed by the Vellala Chetti 
caste against the permission of the Scheduled Castes 
to wear thodus (Vellala Caste and Chetty Caste against 
permitting the Low caste to wear ear rings) PRIMARY

Historians such as K.M. de Silva and Howard 
Wriggins have recorded that even the maternal 
ancestors of J.R. Jayawardene belonged to the 
Colombo Chetty community.17 During the 
burning of the Jaffna Library by the United 
National Party government in 1981, the 
only surviving original copy of the "Yalpana 
Vaipava Malai" was destroyed, resulting in an 
irreplaceable loss.
The influence of the Mahavamsa's prestige 
should also be noted in the context of 
translating the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai" into 
English.
Challenge to the Mahavamsa

intellectual endeavors in Sri Lanka were largely

conducted by colonialists during the colonial 
period. Their role in recovering our history 
was significant.
The Mahavamsa, which had been recognized 
as the history of Sri Lanka until then, was 
written in the 6th century. Historians have 
pointed out that it was authored in Pali by 
Mahānāma Thera and primarily depicted 
the history of the Sinhalese Buddhists. For 
centuries, those who attempted to study Sri 
Lankan history had no access to it in languages 
other than Pali. Efforts to translate it in the 
19th century were not entirely successful. The 
first complete English translation was done by 
George Turnour, who was in the civil service 
in Sri Lanka, and it was published in 1837. 
However, it was criticized for its inaccuracies 
and incompleteness.
In this context, Brito brought out the English 
translation of the "Yalpana Vaipava Malai" in 
1879. In a way, this served to challenge the 
Mahavamsa's narrative, which attempted to 
establish Sri Lankan history as predominantly 
Sinhalese. The translation highlighted details 
about Tamil kingdoms and Tamil kings in 
the North. The necessity of translating the 
Mahavamsa into English was then recognized 
not only by the Sinhalese but also by the 
English.
About 75 years after the flawed translation by 
George Turnour, Wilhelm Geiger published a 
German version. It was later translated back 
into English under the supervision of Mabel 
Haynes Bode, an expert in Pali, and was 
published in 1912.
Navalar's Choice: Ramanathan
At that time, Navalar was in conflict not only 
with Catholics but also with many Saivites. 
Christopher Brito, a Catholic, had considerable 
influence within the Catholic community. 
Newspapers like "The Guardian" and "Ilankai 
nesan" supported Brito. "Udayabanu," another 
newspaper, was established later.
Brito was wealthy, owning land in Kalpitiya, 
Chilaw, Madampe, and Negombo. During the 
cholera outbreak in Jaffna between 1878-1879, 
which claimed many lives, he collaborated 
with Arumuka Navalar in relief efforts. 
Navalar set up a porridge distribution project, 
collecting funds from many notable figures 
and providing porridge for several days. 
Navalar initially donated 20 rupees to start the 
fund. The daily expenses were around 22 to 
25 rupees. Brito contributed 45 rupees to the 
project and personally visited the distribution 
sites every afternoon at 4 PM to collect details.
Brito, along with local residents, Jaffna 
Government Agent W.C. Twynam, District 
Judge D. Saram, and Provincial Assistant C. 
Prime, established the Porridge Distribution 
Charity Society on August 2, 1877. Brito was 
appointed chairman, with Sesh Alagakone, 
Arumuka Navalar, Arunachalam Mudaliar, 
Sinnathambi, and Thambu as members. 
Twynam, Saram, and Prime served as 
advisors.18 Brito's contribution to creating a 
relief fund for the poor was appreciated by 
Twynam.19
In 1879, Brito also served as a member of 
the Colombo Municipal Council. Despite 
working with Brito, Navalar remained 
dissatisfied with him. The primary reason 
for this dissatisfaction was related to the 
Nallur Kandaswamy Temple case. In 1876, a

dispute between the temple's Brahmins and 
its administration escalated to a court case. 
Brito represented the administration as their 
lawyer, while Navalar supported the Brahmins. 
When Navalar entered the courtroom, Brito 
and other lawyers stood up to show respect. 
However, Navalar's resentment towards Brito 
stemmed from Brito's role as the opposing 
counsel in the case.20
Brito was a highly influential, educated, 
socially active, and politically experienced 
elder. However, Navalar brought the relatively 
unqualified Ramanathan into politics 
primarily because Ramanathan was a Saivite. 
Navalar could not tolerate the influence Brito, 
a Christian, had at the time.
On May 15, 1879, the Jaffna Bar Association 
held a meeting where lawyers gathered to 
collect signatures in support of Brito. Senior 
lawyers who supported Ramanathan did not 
attend this meeting, and Navalar's faction 
accused the Jaffna Bar Association of showing 
support for Brito.
In response, Navalar held a public meeting on 
May 22, 1879, at the Saiva Prakasa Vidyalaya 
in Vannarponnai. Nearly 3,500 people 
attended, marking the start of the campaign in 
support of Ramanathan. An article about this 
meeting appeared in the "Colombo Observer" 
newspaper on May 29, 1879. At this time, the 
"Colombo Observer" supported Ramanathan, 
while "The Examiner" supported Brito.21 
Navalar's animosity towards "The Examiner" is 
evident in his writings, particularly in his book 
"Yalpanam Samaya Nilai," where he criticizes 
the newspaper's ongoing campaign against 
Saivites.

Vythilingam, B. A. – Vol -1 – 1971.
The meeting was chaired by Carol 
Viswanathapillai of Suthumalai, the first 
graduate of the University of Madras. In his 
speech, he expressed sorrow over the loss 
of Sir Muthucoomaraswamy and proposed 
Ramanathan, a relative and a lawyer from 
Colombo, for the vacant position. He also 
highlighted the greatness of Ramanathan's 
family background.22
This was seconded by D. Ponnambalam Pillai, 
who was a judge in Thanjavur. Everyone 
present accepted his statements unanimously. 
Navalar, who was suffering from asthma and

Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy, was the first non-
official Tamil representative in the First Legislative 
Council   from 30 May 1835  to 1836. Arumugam Pillai 
acted as an interpreter for the British during the con-
quest and treaty of Kandy. Governor Robert Brownrigg 
has also gifted him a gold ring.</p>

observing from a corner, suddenly became 
emotional and loudly instructed his assistant 
to bring his letters, documents, and cables.
Following this, Arumuga Navalar gave a 
speech, discussing Ponnambalam's family 
background and his contributions to the legal 
field. He stated, "After being elected to the 
Legislative Council, Sir Coomaraswamy did 
not return to Jaffna due to his work. Why 
shouldn't Ramanathan do the same? He is 
qualified for it." Many prominent figures then 
spoke in support of Ramanathan, including 
S. Thillaiyampalam (Udayar of Sandilipay), 
Kandhar Kasippillai (a merchant), S. D. 
Sivapragasam Pillai, E. Mayilvaganam, and S. 
Thurayappa Chettiar. At the meeting, many 
signed in support of Ramanathan. It was 
decided that the next campaign meetings 
would be held on the 24th in Chankanai and 
on the 27th in Nallur. Meetings from both 
sides took place in various locations.
During this period, there were no widespread 
elections or centralized voting. Instead, 
intellectuals and dignitaries would gather to 
express their opinions to the government. 
Ultimately, Ramanathan was successful. On 
August 27, 1879, at the age of 27, Ramanathan 
was appointed to the Legislative Council by the 
then-Governor, James Robert Longden.
Upon Ramanathan's appointment, Brito sent 
his complaint to the colonial secretary. In his 
letter dated June 18, 1879, Brito requested the 
cancellation of Ramanathan's appointment 
and urged respect for the people's decision. He 
detailed the nationwide meetings he had held 
and the support he had garnered, emphasizing 
that he had the backing of a majority of 
Tamils, Muslims, and Malays. However, the 
Governor declared Ramanathan's selection 
to be appropriate, and this response was 
communicated to Brito and his supporters.23
23 Founders of Modern Ceylon (Sri Lanka) EMI-
In the book "Founders of Modern Ceylon" 
by V. Muthucoomaraswamy, there is a 
comprehensive essay about Sir Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan. This essay includes various 
reports, newspaper articles, and meeting 
notes detailing the controversies surrounding 
Ramanathan's entry into politics. However, 
it appears that the book selectively compiles 
information favorable to Ramanathan while 
omitting details from Brito's side, which 
anyone can notice as a biased representation.
One particularly interesting section of the 
book mentions a statement published on May 
15, 1879, in The Observer newspaper by the 
Nattukottai Chettiar community, supporting 
Ramanathan. The statement explains that the 
Nattukottai Chettiars held a meeting, collected 
signatures, and supported Ramanathan's 
appointment to Muthucoomaraswamy's 
position, highlighting his origins, 
Coomaraswamy's contributions, and their 
family's heritage.
The irony here is noteworthy. In 1836, the 
Tamil representative in the Ceylon Legislative 
Council was Mudaliyar Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy, the first Tamil-Muslim 
representative. In 1830, Coomaraswamy was 
elected as the leader of the "non-Christian 
Tamils" in Colombo, an election held at the 
Upper Province Kachcheri.
Coomaraswamy's competitor was Tyagappa, 
a prominent figure in the alcohol production 
industry and a member of the Chettiar 
community. This election was essentially 
a peaceful conflict between the Saiva 
Vellalars and the Saiva Chettiars. There was 
a longstanding rivalry between the Chettiars 
and the Vellalars in Colombo. However, later 
on, the same Chettiar community fought

for the appointment of Sir Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan, a Saiva Vellalar descendant of 
Mudaliyar Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy.
Ganapathy Pillai's Account
Half a century after Sir Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan's appointment, an article was 
published in the "Eelakesari" on Navalar 
Memorial Day (December 15, 1946) that 
discussed this event. This article inspired me 
to write this piece. The article was authored by 
"C.K.," which likely refers to Pandithamani C. 
Ganapathy Pillai.
C. Ganapathy Pillai wrote another version 
of this incident in an essay titled "Nalavar 
Ezhunthar" in the 10th annual Tamil literary 
textbook of Sri Lanka. He mentions:
"Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan was 25 years 
old at the time. He had a smiling face and a 
golden complexion. He had just returned from 
studying in Madras. Although he was from 
Jaffna, the people of Jaffna knew nothing about 
him. He had recently arrived in Jaffna.
Brito was a famous and experienced lawyer. He 
was considered one of the top legal experts of 
the time. Everyone in Sri Lanka knew him. He 
had a significant reputation in both Colombo 
and Jaffna. It was customary to appoint him 
for major cases and appeals. He wielded 
considerable influence in Jaffna during those 
days..."
The article continues and, at one point, 
mentions the reason for the animosity 
between Navalar and Brito. During the Nallur 
Kandaswamy Temple case, Navalar supported 
the Brahmins, while Brito argued on behalf of 
the temple administration. Brito reportedly 
suggested to Navalar's associates that he could 
ensure the Brahmins' victory in exchange for 
Navalar's support in his own cases. Navalar 
viewed Brito's actions as lacking integrity and 
opposed him on these grounds.
C. Ganapathy Pillai presents this as a 
conjecture, using phrases like "it seems" to 
indicate that Brito may have mentioned this in 
some of his letters or cables. He writes:
"In the same letter, 'Navalar Ezhunthar,' he 
concludes with, 'One note: Those who told me 
this story a thousand times were eyewitnesses 
to the meeting and were involved with it. They 
included Navalar's nephew's son, those who 
wrote their history, and my teachers...'"
We must recognize that the Tamil-Saiva-
Vellalar tradition, represented by Navalar, had 
the privilege of recording history. Therefore, 
it is essential to consider the possibility of bias 
in the accounts recorded by those who have 
written about these events.</p>

Ramanathan and Brito as Relatives
Ramanathan and Brito were actually relatives, 
having married daughters of E. Nannithamby, 
a wealthy man from Manipay. Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan married Sellachi Ammal in 1874, 
and Brito married her sister Thangamma in 
1866. This made Ramanathan and Brito closely 
related. Brito's son, C.M. Brito, later became a 
renowned Supreme Court lawyer, mentored by 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan.24
Thirumeniyar Venkatasalapillai of 
Valvettithurai, who was Prabhakaran's 
great-grandfather, supported Brito's entry 
into politics. However, Arumuga Navalar, 
determined to bring a Saiva Vellalar into 
politics, used his full efforts to introduce 
Ramanathan instead. If this event had not 
occurred, the political history of Sri Lanka 
24 Arnold wright - Twentieth Century Impression of 
Ceylon – Lloyd’s greater Britain publishing company 
limited (1907)
might have taken a different path.
Christians supported Brito, while Navalar 
rallied the Saivites behind Ponnambalam. 
Navalar promoted Ramanathan as someone 
deeply interested in Saivism, Tamil culture, 
and its heritage. Prominent figures like J.R. 
Arnold Sadasivam Pillai, Carol Vairamuthu, 
and Viswanathapillai25 joined Navalar against 
Brito. According to D. Sabaratnam, this was 
the first instance of Tamils, especially in 
the North, actively participating in political 
activities.26
Navalar wrote to the British government, 
advocating for Tamil education in English 
while emphasizing the need to maintain 
their Hindu identity. Rajan Hoole notes 
that Navalar's objection was rooted in his 
opposition to lower castes studying alongside 
others, reflecting an inner sentiment to 
promote a Saiva Vellalar like Ramanathan in 
politics to exclude others.27
Ramanathan carried forward Navalar's 
principles, acting as a devoted disciple. Later, 
during the Donoughmore Commission's visit, 
when the British proposed universal suffrage, 
Ramanathan opposed it. He was firmly against 
granting voting rights to women, lower castes, 
illiterate people, and the underprivileged. 
Similarly, he opposed a distinct identity 
25 Viswanatha Pillai: One of the first two to graduate 
from Madras University. The other is C.Y. Damodaram 
Pillai. Initially, he attended a Christian college and 
became a Christian and took the name Carol. Initially, 
he also argued against Navalar. Then he returned to 
Saivism and became a good friend of Navalar.

for Muslims, arguing that they should be 
represented under the Tamil identity without 
separate representation.
Professor K. Sivathamby notes an incident 
at Kopay Teacher Training College where 
teachers from the Pallars community were 
made to dine separately from higher caste 
teachers.28 Rajan Hoole mentions that non-
Vellalar students were not admitted to 
Navalar's Hindu College until the 1960s. 
Ramanathan's family had a history of political 
representation dating back to Mudaliyar 
Arumugathapillai Coomaraswamy, who 
was appointed the first Tamil-Muslim 
representative by the British government on 
October 30, 1830. Successive members of the 
Coomaraswamy family continued this political 
legacy, with Ramanathan serving in the 
28 Sri Lankan Tamil society and politics / Karthigesu 
Sivathamby - Madras : New Century Book House, 
1995
government for over half a century.
Christopher Brito, who made significant 
contributions to the revival of Tamil heritage 
in Sri Lanka, passed away on December 26, 
1910, in Thiruvananthapuram.29 His efforts 
were instrumental in the cultural renaissance 
among Tamils.
Navalar's racial, religious, and caste pride 
undoubtedly influenced his efforts to install 
Ramanathan in politics. However, Ramanathan 
did not grow into the leader Navalar and his 
followers had envisioned. Instead, he became 
a national leader for all of Sri Lanka, although 
Sinhalese nationalist forces continue to portray 
him as one of the founding fathers of Tamil 
nationalism.

The fight happened so long ago. But it is 
still fresh in my heart, as if it happened just 
yesterday …
In those days, the fragrance of the impending 
Haj celebration would start wafting in the air 
three or four days prior to the holy day itself.
On the eve of the Haj, Paiyeṉṉā “hotel” 
was abuzz with activity. The two showcases 
sparkled; the delicacies arranged within 
them twinkled. The fragrance of the muscat, 
lovingly matured in cow ghee by Paiyeṉṉā’s 
hand, was irresistible. A piece cost twenty 
cents. A cup of tea was ten cents.
The tea made by Paiyeṉṉā’s hand using 
“Nona brand” condensed milk had its own 
unique deliciousness. It was magical how the 
touch of his hand blending the condensed 
milk and the tightly infused tea water elevated 
the taste. 
On exiting the “hotel” after a bite of the 
muscat and a sip of tea, one noticed the flyer, 
stuck to the portia tree which was like a 
natural air conditioner for the hotel.
To mark the Haj, there was going to 
be a grand martial arts competition 
following the Asr evening prayers at the 
mosque. Challengers were invited to 
fight Nūhuththambi, renowned teacher of 
cheeṉadi—the stick-based martial art in 
Eastern Sri Lanka inspired by ancient Shaolin 
monks. The victor would be rewarded with a 
Meccan Shawl and an entire cluster of paṟangi 
plantains.
The holy day celebrations that year had 
been grand. The sun had reached its peak 
overhead and had started on its lopsided 
descent towards Uppāṟu. Multitudes from the 
neighboring villages swarmed towards the 
village marketplace.
We, the village tots, crouched down on our 
haunches, squeezing between the legs of 
adults in the front row.
The village headman and the mattichem 
trustees from the mosque were managing 
the crowd. Time crawled. The challenger 
aṇṇāviyār and his disciples were getting 
restless. Teacher Nūhuththambi who had 
issued the challenge was nowhere to be seen. 
Everyone kept looking at the riverside road. 
Sarcastic talk and putdowns started raising 
their heads. At a distance, a bicycle was 
hurtling fast towards the market.
“Here he is! Hoyrā…!”
A roar went through the crowd instantly 
rekindling the buzz.
It was indeed Nūhuththambi. He hopped off 
the bicycle seemingly without slowing down, 
handing the bicycle over to someone else. The 
next instant, he leapt to the center of the street 
where the challenge fight was to take place.
He had a physique like an ebony tree. The 
years of casting fishnets had reinforced his 
arms and legs. He looked like a bull that could 
not be tamed.
Once again, applause and whistles rose up 
from the crowd. He removed the Indian 
‘pazhaiyagād’ sarong he was wearing. The 
sarong flew from his hand over to the portia 
tree and stuck to it. Inside he was wearing the 
siṟuvāl underwear covering his thighs down to 
his knees, and a sleeved undershirt.
From his buffed chest, two long arms emerged 
like fine swords. Rooted to the same spot, 
he swirled his hands bent down suddenly—
having first leapt into the air—to kiss the 
ground, seeking permission and the traditional</p>

ritual salām varisai salute of cheeṉadi 
practitioners. The crowd went into an ecstatic 
roar and calmed down.
The village headman made the formal 
announcement: “Anyone who wants to 
challenge Nūhuththambi, come forward!”
A figure emerged at the far end of the teeming 
crowd. It swirled and twirled, moving through 
the lightning streaks traced by the rapid 
movements of the pole, made of wood from 
a kalviṇṇāṅku tree, held in its hands. The 
kalviṇṇāṅku pole whooshed with a high-
pitched howl.
In their excitement, the spectators’ feet barely 
held on to the ground below them. The hands 
and feet of those who knew how to play 
cheenadi were itching to get into the arena.
“The winner of this game will be given a 
cluster of plantains as the prize and will be 
honored by the draping of a Meccan shawl.”
The village headman’s announcement elicited 
thundering applause.
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār stood on one side, 
Teacher Nūhuththambi on the other. Each 
unique in his own ways. A peerless pair.
First, they stood facing each other, sixteen 
cubits apart. The headman yelled, “Start!” The</p>

next instant, both kicked up dust storms as 
they took their salām varisai.
They swirled like whirlpools—leaping into 
midair—as four arms sliced the air like 
lightning…. people’s eyes only saw two 
amorphous figures spinning like tops.
Having taken their salām varisai, they 
retreated to their corners and stood there.
Weligāmam Maulana Wāppā was 
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār’s guru. Wāppā’s son 
took the cheeṉadi stick blessed by Maulana 
Wāppā and handed it to the Aṇṇāviyār who 
grabbed onto it respectfully.
The stick stood between the fingers in his 
hands and danced with a high-pitched drone. 
The one stick became four, and then sixteen, 
and exploded into many more, weaving a 
magic trick for the watching eyes.
On the opposite side, Teacher Nūhuththambi 
stood holding the cheeṉadi stick blessed by 
his guru, the Indian nānā. 
It was a bamboo cane with silver rings at 
either end. He lifted it with his right hand and 
swirled it.
His left hand remained motionless while the 
right hand twisted and turned. That was a skill 
and facility that only he excelled in. Like a 
silver bird flying with its entourage, weaving 
up and down in pitch-perfect formation before 
disappearing into the horizon, the silver-
ringed cane in Nūhuththambi’s hands just flew 
hither and thither.
The first round was over and the second 
began. The two crows glared intently at each 
other through their fighting sticks and snarled. 
They chased each other around … they each 
invited the other to battle, again and again, 
…. They circled each other, wearing out 
the opponent, and then suddenly leapt like 
lightning… grappling with each other…
The dust storm that rose from the ground was 
a sight to behold!
Out of nowhere, Nūhuththambi’s silver 
pigeon leapt up to lightly graze Ahmadlebbe 
Aṇṇāviyār’s shoulder in a flash and returned. 
Aṇṇāviyār, momentarily shaken, steadied 
himself by planting his feet firmly on the 
ground. 
“He is hit, he is hit, Aṇṇāviyār is hit on the 
head!” Mammali and I screamed at the top 
of our voices. In the village, we had, in fact, 
earned a reputation for being little rascals.
“Dēy! Shut up. Who do you think you are 
talking to!” Eerāṅkutti, one of Aṇṇāviyār’s 
disciples hissed with rage.
“Not hit, not hit… yeah, right, only these 
misbegotten tots managed to see what all 
these important people couldn’t see!”
Village headman Buhāri, who was refereeing 
the fight, did not see what actually happened 
because he was momentarily distracted. 
The restless crowd clamored. Aṇṇāvi 
Ahmadlebbe’s disciples encircled the ring, 
grinding their teeth.
They were literally shaking, looking as if they 
wanted to jump on Teacher Nūhuththambi and 
shred him to pieces.
“Dēy! You think our man can be hit? Bring it 
on!” each swirled his fighting stick, seething 
with rage.
Teacher Nūhuththambi stood alone aghast, 
his hand covering his mouth. Calming Aṇṇāvi 
Ahmadlebbe’s disciples down was a herculean</p>

task for the village mosque’s mattichem 
trustees.
“Dēy! Shut up, all of you,” the headman 
yelled in a commanding voice, cane in hand. 
The crowd calmed down like an obedient 
kitten.
“Let us resume the fight.”
The village headman decided.
“What! Resume the fight? You must be 
kidding!” Teacher Nūhuththambi was 
adamant.
“We didn’t see you hit him…” the bulk of the 
crowd retorted.
Outrage surged within Nūhuththambi’s heart.
“Not only did they rob me of my victory, 
but they have also resorted to abuse me for 
my fisherfolk caste.” Tears welled up in his 
eyes. As if he was possessed, he picked up 
his silver-ringed cane in a frenzy. The fight 
resumed. Everyone’s eyes were fixated on the 
cane.. and the stick.
As the game proceeded, Nūhuththambi felt as 
if a fiery pearl flew through the air and struck 
him in the eyes. His eyes burnt. He lifted a 
hand towards his eyes. Just at that moment, 
the serpent thrown by Aṇṇāviyār bit his 
shoulder and retreated.
“He is hit, he is hit… Aṇṇāviyār has won.”
They lifted Aṇṇāviyār up in the air. The 
headman and the mattichem trustees draped 
the Meccan shawl over his shoulder. Paiyeṉṉā 
took the cluster of paṟangi plantains hanging 
in his eatery and handed it to Aṇṇāviyār.
They took him in a procession as the salawat 
prayer praising the prophet, blending with the 
ululations of the women, reached sky high.</p>

“Thambi, a penny for your thoughts?”
His voice broke my reverie and brought me 
back from bygone memories to the present.
“I remember very well. Very well, indeed. 
What happened to you that day was injustice,” 
I said calmly.
“That day, I left behind this soil and my kith 
and kin. Now, I have returned after thirty 
years, and I am glad to see that you have 
grown into an important man in the village.”
His eyes became moist.
“Mammanifā, two of my kids are attending 
university in Colombo. My eldest went abroad 
to work and has returned with two outboard 
motors to go deep-sea fishing. Now people 
respect us as somebody. On that day, we 
didn’t get justice because we are fisherfolk. 
Today one of ours has become the leader of 
the village and of Allah’s school. Our rotting 
fish goes for a hundred rupees per kilo, son. 
It has become five times more expensive than 
rice.”
In his heart, the swirl that started all those 
years ago had grown into a roaring tsunami.
“What should we do now?”
“I want justice. I want a rematch with 
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār. I want to be draped 
in a Meccan Shawl!” He spoke with passion.</p>

This man has such a desire after all these 
years? Perhaps he is a little demented?
My heart was anguished.
“Why the hesitation? I will stay the night at 
my elder sister’s place. I will return after the 
early morning subhu prayers. Tell me your 
decision.”
He stroked his silvery beard that hung from 
his chin like cotton wool and quickly ran 
down the steps.
“Anybody home?” I called out.
“Come in, come in, thambi!”
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār’s wife herself 
welcomed me.
“Where is Aṇṇāviyār?”
“He has gone to oversee the paddy fields in 
Padukādu. He should be returning any minute 
now,” she started moving slowly towards the 
kitchen …
A teapot climbed up on the clay stove. Even 
after fifty, her beauty was intact. All her 
teeth were like white pearls. There was an 
occasional gray streak in her hair.
“What is it thambi, you have come here after 
a long time?”
“I want to see Aṇṇāvi chāchā.” Even before 
I could finish, a bicycle peeked through the 
front entrance. Our ensuing conversation 
meandered all over the place and finally 
arrived at Teacher Nūhuththambi.
“Chāchā, it happened thirty years ago. But it 
is still fresh in my heart …”
“Yes, son! That day, it was he who …” 
Aṇṇāvi held himself back. His face reflected 
the rush of emotions. It was as if the Meccan 
shawl on his shoulder suddenly became 
unbearably heavy…
“A rematch? Why not,” he said distractedly, 
his thoughts dwelling on something.
“What? A cheenadi fight? These old men, at 
their age?” Chāchi mocked.
It was a Jummah day.
After the Asr prayers, people emerged from 
the mosque, having forgotten their fears and 
worries …
Paiyeṉṉā hotel lay in ruins—the market stalls 
had been long abandoned—its padlock lay 
rusting.
The crowds jostled as if it was a funeral.
The two seventy-year-old young men stood in 
the ring…
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār tied a rubber band 
to the temples of his eyeglasses and tied it 
behind the back of his head. His eyesight had 
deteriorated after he hit his forties.
None of the mosque mattichem trustees from 
that day were alive any longer. All of them 
had been reunited with the soil. New blood 
was administering the village now.
“Begin!”
The fight started, commanded by the new 
village headman. Aṇṇāviyār held the same 
kalviṇṇāṅku-pole; its oils had dried out but 
still emitted the same low-pitch drone and 
swayed like a cobra. He squatted, straightened 
up and whirled, jumping into the air, and bent 
down again in one smooth motion to touch the</p>

soil and kiss it.
Nūhuththambi mastān had the same silver-
rimmed bamboo cane. It took wings in his 
hand, flew around and cackled. His one-
handed swirling made the bamboo cane 
produce an ethereal hum.
The two seventy-year-old crows swam, dived, 
and resurfaced. Their chests swelled up and 
subsided.
The fight resumed.
Nūhuththambi mastān brimmed with the thirst 
for revenge as he swirled like fire.
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār stood calmly looking 
for an opportunity to trap his opponent. He 
had been parrying every blow of the bamboo 
cane deftly and cleverly when it happened.
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār’s eyeglasses 
came loose, flew to the other side of 
road and shattered. At that very instant, 
Nūhuththambi’s white dove went right next to 
Aṇṇāviyār’s shoulder …
If the white dove had wanted, it could have 
pecked at the shoulder. It hesitated just for a 
moment, and retreated …
Aṇṇāviyār saw hundreds of white doves, 
making him gasp.
Nūhuththambi mastān slowed down. As the 
bamboo bird in his hand flew in circles, the 
train of his thoughts pleaded plaintively at 
him.
‘His eyesight is hazy. It is not fair for me to 
fight him. Even at this age, Allah has blessed 
me with strength and light in my eyes. That is 
the greatest prize.’ his conscience delivered its 
judgment.
The next instant, the silver-ringed bamboo 
dove flew away from his hands as he 
leapt towards Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār and 
embraced him to begin a musaba, the formal 
two-handed handshake.
Ahmadlebbe Aṇṇāviyār, too, cast away his 
kalviṇṇāṅku-tree pole.
The two crows embraced each other, did 
musaba, and kissed …
The spectators had goosebumps and tears in 
their eyes.
Aṇṇāviyār extricated himself from mastān’s 
embrace and appeared to be getting ready to 
say something. The crowd quietened down 
expectantly.
“Assalāmu alaikum! It was Nūhuththambi 
who won the fight thirty years ago. My empty 
vanity did not allow me to acknowledge that 
victory. He was the victor then and he is, 
now.” He respectfully removed the Meccan 
shawl which was tied around his hips. The 
same shawl that the crowd had draped on his 
shoulders to honor him for the fight thirty 
years ago. He brought its two edges together 
and flapped it vigorously, and in one deft 
motion, draped it around Nūhuththambi 
mastān’s shoulders. Tears of joy trickled 
down from his eyes, relieved at discarding the 
guilt that weighed on him all these years, and 
from the satisfaction of having bestowed the 
honor of the Meccan shawl upon its rightful 
recipient.
The salawat prayers praising the greatness 
of the prophet reached sky high. The portia 
tree smiled with joy. The fragrance of the 
attar wafting from the Meccan shawl draped 
around Nūhuththambi mastān’s shoulders 
filled the air.</p>
