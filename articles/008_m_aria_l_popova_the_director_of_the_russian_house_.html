M
aria L. Popova, the Director of the 
Russian House in Colombo and First 
Secretary of the Russian Embassy in Sri Lanka 
is a distinguished figure in cultural diplomacy. 
Widely respected for her efforts, her leadership 
has played a pivotal role in strengthening 
cultural ties between Sri Lanka and Russia.
A writer herself, she has actively fostered 
literary connections between the two nations 
and has contributed significantly to the 
translation of Russian literary works into 
Sinhala.
With a professional journey that began in 
prominent media institutions — including 
Capital FM Moscow — and later at the 
Consulate General of Russia in San Francisco, 
she has seamlessly transitioned into a 
diplomatic role focused on cultural outreach.
Over the course of nearly a triennium in 
Colombo, she has exerted a profound impact 
on bilateral cultural exchange, spearheading 
substantive collaborations across education, 
the arts, and public diplomacy.
Beyond her official remit, Maria L. Popova 
is also recognized for her refined aesthetic 
sensibilities and steadfast advocacy for Sri 
Lankan fashion. She artfully amalgamates 
Russian elegance with indigenous textile 
traditions and passionately champions the 
regional fashion and textile industry.
This exclusive interview with Jaffna Monitor 
unveils a cultural envoy whose endeavors 
continue to bridge nations—not merely 
through diplomatic channels, but through 
the enduring conduits of people, literature, 
fashion, and shared heritage.
In your view, what makes the 
Russian Cultural Center in Sri Lanka 
significant?
The Russian Cultural Center in Colombo holds 
a special place in the history of Sri Lanka–
Russia relations. It was officially established 
in its current location in 1986 under the 
Russia–Sri Lanka Friendship Agreement, 
though its presence dates back even earlier as 
the Soviet Cultural Center in Colombo 2. The 
inauguration was a historic moment, attended 
by then-President J.R. Jayewardene, who 
ceremonially opened the center and planted a 
sapling in the courtyard — a tree that has since 
become a beloved symbol of our enduring 
friendship.
Over the years, that tree has become part 
of our identity — featured in numerous 
cultural events, from literary tributes to art 
performances. During one celebration of 
Alexander Pushkin’s birthday, for example, 
we even recreated a mermaid scene on its 
branches, inspired by one of his fairy tales. Its 
presence continues to inspire and anchor our 
community activities.
But more importantly, the Russian Cultural 
Center exists to share Russia's rich artistic and 
intellectual heritage—from literature, ballet, 
chess, and classical music to language and 
higher education. It’s a place where cultures 
connect and where Sri Lankans can explore 
Russia’s contributions to global civilization.
One of our key missions is to promote 
Russian higher education. In 2024 alone, the 
Russian Government offered 50 fully funded 
scholarships to Sri Lankan students in fields 
ranging from medicine and engineering to arts

and humanities. With nearly four applicants 
per seat, the demand has been remarkable, 
prompting discussions to increase the quota to 
80 scholarships next year — at the request of 
Sri Lankan authorities.
What fields of study are the Russian 
scholarships offered for, and how are 
the students selected?
The scholarships offered by the Russian 
Federation cover a wide range of academic 
streams, including Bachelor’s, Master’s, and 
Postgraduate degrees. One of the most popular 
fields among Sri Lankan students is General 
Medicine. Over the years, many Sri Lankan 
graduates from renowned institutions like the 
Moscow State Medical University, the Pirogov 
Russian National Research Medical University, 
and, of course, the highly popular People’s 
Friendship University have gone on to build 
highly successful careers — some of them 
now hold prominent positions in government 
institutions and the healthcare sector in Sri 
Lanka. Their success has inspired the next 
generation, including their children, to pursue 
medical education in Russia.
Beyond medicine, we’ve also observed an 
increasing interest in Tourism and Hospitality 
Management, Information Technology, 
Natural Sciences, and Fashion Design. 
During my two and a half years here, I’ve 
personally been impressed with how fashion 
is developing in Sri Lanka. Many young 
designers have immense talent and creativity. 
To support this growing creative sector, we 
are planning a collaborative fashion show 
featuring Sri Lankan designers inspired by 
Russian culture.
How are students selected for Russian 
Government scholarships? Is there a 
district quota system?
No, there is no district or ethnic quota system. 
All Sri Lankan citizens with valid passports are 
eligible to apply, regardless of background. The 
selection is entirely merit-based, transparent, 
and competitive.
Applications are submitted via the official 
platform – education-in-russia.com – usually 
starting in September. The process includes:
• Online Registration: Uploading certified 
translations of O/L and A/L results.
• University Preferences: Applicants 
may list up to five preferred Russian 
universities.
• Document Review: Our team in 
Colombo checks eligibility and 
completeness.
• Final Selection: Based on academic 
results and supporting materials such as 
articles, certificates, or awards.
To assist applicants, we run a 24/7 live support 
chat in English and Sinhala and regularly hold 
online/offline seminars across Sri Lanka.
Recently, we hosted a Russian Higher 
Education Fair with 22 universities from 
across Russia — from Crimea to Siberia — 
offering students the chance to interact with 
university representatives and explore diverse 
academic programs.
Currently, we collaborate with nearly 30 
Russian universities, including leading 
institutions in Aviation, Medicine, 
Engineering, IT, and Design. One of our 
notable partnerships is with a prominent 
aviation university in St. Petersburg, which is 
attracting increasing interest from Sri Lankan 
students.</p>

Our mission is to keep strengthening these 
academic links and ensure that more Sri 
Lankan students have access to world-class 
education in Russia.
What efforts are being made to 
connect Sri Lankan readers with 
Russian literature?
Russian literature has always resonated 
with Sri Lankan readers — with enduring 
admiration for authors like Maxim Gorky, 
Alexander Pushkin, and Anton Chekhov. But 
we are now also promoting contemporary 
Russian voices, bridging the gap between 
modern Russian authors and Sri Lankan 
translators, poets, and critics.
A key example is the Sinhala translation of 
the internationally acclaimed novel “Laurus” 
by Eugene Vodolazkin, known for his blend 
of historical fiction and spiritual themes. This 
translation was done by Felix Fernando, a 
distinguished philologist who has played a 
vital role in expanding the reach of Russian 
literature in Sri Lanka.
Another writer we’re proud to introduce is 
Alexander Tsypkin, a popular short story 
writer, screenwriter, and cultural commentator. 
His Christmas short story was also translated 
into Sinhala by Felix Fernando, marking a step 
forward in showcasing contemporary Russian 
literature to local audiences.
To further support this literary exchange, the 
Russian House hosts an annual Literature 
Festival, bringing together translators, writers, 
and academics from across Sri Lanka. It’s a 
platform to celebrate Russian literary heritage 
while building new bridges of collaboration 
and creativity.
Has there been any effort to translate 
Russian literature into Tamil in Sri 
Lanka?
At present, most of the Russian literary 
translations available in Sri Lanka are 
in Sinhala. However, we recognize the 
importance of making Russian literature 
accessible to Tamil-speaking audiences. 
This is an area where we are actively seeking 
collaboration.
If there is someone with a strong command 
of both Russian and Tamil, we would be 
delighted to work with them. It is an open 
invitation to anyone who wishes to contribute 
to this cultural and linguistic bridge. We are 
eager to support such initiatives and are open 
to partnerships with literary organizations, 
translators, and educational institutions in the 
Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.
How important is literature to Russia 
as a country and to its citizens?
It is part of our DNA. It’s something we are 
born into, something that becomes a part of 
our identity from a very young age.
Speaking for myself, I simply cannot imagine 
my life without literature. I’m an avid reader. 
Not just within Russian literature, but globally, 
I find great inspiration in both the classics and 
modern literary voices. But when it comes to 
Russian literature specifically, I feel a deep, 
almost unexplainable sense of pride.
Some people even start learning the Russian 
language just to be able to read their 
masterpieces in the original text. That, to me, 
is one of the greatest tributes to the power of 
literature — and to the cultural depth of our 
country.</p>

At the beginning of this year, we launched a new 
video project dedicated to great Russian literary 
figures. I realized that while many people in Sri Lanka 
have heard of Pushkin or Sergei Yesenin, they often 
aren't familiar with other remarkable Russian poets 
and authors — especially those from the Silver Age 
of Russian poetry in the 1960s and 70s, a period of 
extraordinary artistic expression during the Soviet era.
This era produced poets whose works remain relevant 
and powerful today. I want to introduce these voices to 
the Sri Lankan audience.
Through our new initiative, we aim to feature 
translated readings, visual storytelling, and 
educational materials about poets like Boris 
Pasternak, Bella Akhmadulina, Joseph Brodsky, Anna 
Akhmatova, and others who deserve 
global recognition. These are the 
voices that shaped the emotional and 
philosophical fabric of a generation 
— and they deserve to be heard 
beyond Russian borders.
Do the younger generation 
of Russian children still read 
like previous generations, 
especially given the influence 
of smartphones and television?
This is a challenge faced globally. 
The digital age has fundamentally 
changed how young people engage 
with the world.
Speaking personally, I have a 14-year-
old son, and I find myself constantly 
negotiating with him about screen 
time. Whenever he has a free 
moment, his smartphone is in his 
hands — usually watching TikTok 
or short videos. He’s a bright boy, 
and it’s not that he lacks depth or 
curiosity, but like many of his peers, 
the allure of fast content and constant 
stimulation is very strong.
When I was growing up, books were 
my escape. I always had one in my 
hands. We didn’t have internet, we 
didn’t have streaming platforms 
or social media, and going to the 
cinema was an occasional treat. 
Naturally, books became our closest 
companions.
Today, the environment has changed. 
The modern world is fast, digital, 
and visually driven — and we cannot 
wish it away. But I don’t see this as 
a tragedy. Rather, I believe it’s up to 
Maria L. Popova at Sri Kaileswaram Kovil in Captain’s Garden</p>

us — the older generation, educators, cultural 
leaders, and parents — to find creative and 
engaging ways to draw young people back to 
the joy of literature.
That’s why we launched a new initiative this 
year: a visual storytelling project dedicated 
to classic and modern Russian literature. 
It combines poetry, imagery, voice, and 
animation to make these works more 
accessible and appealing to the digital-native 
generation.
Would you consider organizing a literary 
or cultural project in the Northern and 
Eastern parts of Sri Lanka, where the 
Tamil community — with its own rich 
literary tradition — is the majority?
I would absolutely love to. If there is genuine 
interest from the Tamil-speaking community, 
I see no reason why we shouldn’t. In fact, 
I would be truly excited to collaborate on 
something meaningful in that region. Sri 
Lankan Tamils have a deeply rooted and 
profound literary heritage, and as someone 
who believes in literature as a bridge between 
cultures, I see this as a beautiful opportunity 
for mutual exchange.
This is an open invitation — if someone with 
the necessary linguistic expertise is interested, 
we at the Russian House would be eager to 
collaborate.
On the education front, I also want to extend 
our support to students in the North and 
East who are interested in studying in Russia. 
We understand that traveling from places 
like Jaffna or Batticaloa to Colombo can be 
challenging and costly. That’s why we are 
actively promoting online “Meet &amp; Greet” 
sessions with Russian universities.
These virtual open days allow students to:
• Join remotely from anywhere in the 
country
• Watch real-time presentations by Russian 
universities
• Ask questions directly to university 
representatives and academic advisors
• Learn about available programs, 
scholarships, and the application process
So here’s what I propose: whenever we 
organize these sessions — which we do 
regularly — we will inform Jaffna Monitor. 
You can then help spread the word across your 
community. Interested students can simply 
join online — there’s no need to travel.
Why don’t you open a Russian Cultural 
Center in Jaffna?
I would genuinely love to see that happen 
— but unfortunately, it’s not a decision I can 
make on my own. The establishment of an 
official branch of the Russian House in any 
city requires an intergovernmental agreement 
between the Russian Federation and the 
Government of Sri Lanka.
That said, while we may not be able to open 
a full-fledged center right away, we’ve had 
positive experiences establishing satellite 
projects, particularly Russian language courses 
in various parts of the country.
One such example is our collaboration with 
the University of Peradeniya about a year and 
a half ago, where we successfully launched a 
Russian language course. The response was 
very encouraging — we had over 20 students, 
conducted examinations according to official 
standards, and even created a small literary 
corner on campus. However, after a change in 
university leadership, the new management</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
33
decided not to continue with the program, 
despite its popularity. So for now, that 
initiative has been paused.
Then why not consider launching 
something similar at a university in the 
Northern or Eastern Province?
We are open to that idea, absolutely. It’s 
something we are thinking about seriously. But 
for such a project to succeed, we need to find 
a qualified and passionate Russian language 
teacher who is either based in Jaffna or willing 
to travel from Colombo regularly.
Personally, I am a maximalist. As long as I 
am here, I am committed to expanding the 
presence of the Russian language and culture 
across the island.
In fact, we’ve already seen success in other 
regions. For instance, we launched a Russian 
language course at the Police Academy in 
Galle for officers in the Tourist Police Division. 
The program began on June 10, 2022, and ran 
for a full year with 25 officers participating. 
It was a meaningful step in bridging the 
communication gap between Russian tourists 
and local authorities — and a great example of 
how Russian language skills can have practical, 
professional applications in Sri Lanka.
So yes, if we can identify the right partners and 
passionate educators, Jaffna or any part of the 
North or East would be an exciting next step 
for us.
What was the purpose of teaching 
Russian to police officers?
The purpose was very straightforward — to 
help them better communicate with Russian 
tourists, especially in key tourist hubs like 
Galle, where multiple tourist routes converge. 
There’s been a steady increase in Russian 
visitors to Sri Lanka in recent years, and 
naturally, there’s a growing need for basic 
Russian language skills among frontline 
service providers.
Due to high demand, we launched a Russian 
language course for Tourist Police officers 
in Galle in 2022. It was extremely popular 
and the response exceeded our expectations. 
The officers were incredibly disciplined, 
never missed a class, and showed a genuine 
eagerness to learn. When I visited them a few 
months later, I was amazed — they stood up 
and spoke confidently in Russian. It was truly 
heartwarming to see how much effort they had 
put in.
Following this success, we were approached 
by the National Police Academy in Colombo, 
and in February this year, we launched another 
Russian language course there. Once again, 
they’re showing excellent results. The course 
also provides an official Russian language 
certificate, which for many officers has been 
a valuable addition to their professional 
qualifications.
Why do so many Russian tourists 
choose Sri Lanka? What makes it so 
special for them?
Of course, affordability plays a part. Compared 
to other tropical destinations like the Maldives 
— which has become quite expensive in recent 
years — Sri Lanka still offers great value. For 
those staying in three- or four-star hotels, it’s 
an ideal choice. Even though five-star resorts 
have raised their prices, the experience here 
feels more authentic, and more immersive.
But what truly draws Russians is the 
combination of stunning natural beauty and 
ancient cultural richness. Russians aren’t just</p>

looking for a place to lie on a beach — they 
want to feel, to learn, to connect. And Sri 
Lanka offers that rare chance to walk barefoot 
along golden shores in the morning… and by 
afternoon, be standing before thousand-year-
old ruins that whisper the stories of forgotten 
kings.
We both revere our past, honor tradition 
and take pride in our heritage. Whether it’s 
a museum in Moscow or a sacred stupa in 
Anuradhapura, there is a shared respect for 
what came before us. And that creates a sense 
of familiarity — a kind of quiet kinship.
With eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 
dramatic landscapes, spiritual sanctuaries, and 
welcoming people, it feels like a journey that 
feeds both the heart and the mind.
And personally? I can tell you from 
experience: this island stays with you.
Every month, I visit the Sri Kaileswaram Kovil 
in Captain’s Garden, right in Colombo. It’s 
a Hindu temple — ancient, powerful, full of 
color, light, and energy. I call it my place of 
power. The rituals, the chanting, the fire — it’s 
not just something to see, it’s something to 
feel. Every time I bring someone new there — 
friends, colleagues, even visiting diplomats — 
they’re overwhelmed. Some cry. Some just fall 
silent. But everyone leaves changed.
How enthusiastic are Sri Lankans 
about learning the Russian language?
At the Russian House in Colombo, we offer 
certified language courses at A1 and A2 levels, 
which attract a wide range of participants — 
from students preparing to study in Russia 
to professionals in tourism, hospitality, and 
business.
Our language department includes five 
qualified instructors: three native Russian-
speaking female teachers and two Sri Lankan 
philologists, both graduates of the Peoples’ 
Friendship University of Russia (RUDN). 
These Sri Lankan instructors are also respected 
translators who have enriched local literature 
by rendering Russian classics and modern 
works into Sinhala.
Is there any similar initiative for the 
tourism industry?
Absolutely. We recognized the need to expand 
beyond the police force and created a program 
called “Russian for Tourism”, which is now 
offered at the Russian House in Colombo — 
primarily on weekends. The course teaches:
• Basic conversational Russian
• Grammar essentials
• Key vocabulary for hospitality
• Descriptions of Sri Lanka’s major tourist 
attractions — in Russian
The program is designed to be practical, user-
friendly, and affordable — with fees kept 
reasonable to make it widely accessible.
With more Russian companies expressing 
interest in hiring Sri Lankans, we’ve developed 
an intensive Russian language course for 
migrant workers planning to move to Russia. 
The course is tailored to prepare them for the 
mandatory Russian language exam required 
by Russian immigration authorities for foreign 
workers.
This exam is crucial — without passing it, 
entry for employment is not permitted. Our 
course is available both online and offline and 
is structured to fast-track learners depending 
on how quickly they need to travel.</p>

What kinds of jobs are Sri Lankans 
going for in Russia?
The opportunities are diverse. Many Sri 
Lankans are being hired in manufacturing 
plants, production lines, courier and delivery 
services, and increasingly, in the garment 
sector — especially women skilled in tailoring 
and clothing production. This demand is 
rising steadily.
We even had a delegation from a Russian 
state agency involved in international labor 
relations visit the Russian House in Colombo. 
We discussed structured, transparent 
recruitment pathways for Sri Lankan workers.
Why are Sri Lankans choosing to 
go to Russia for work? There were 
allegations that some were sent to war 
under the pretext of employment — 
can you clarify?
One of the main reasons Sri Lankans are 
opting to work in Russia is the attractive 
salary packages. On average, workers can 
expect to earn around USD 500 per month, 
which is considerably higher than many 
local wages, especially in rural areas. In 
addition to the salary, employers often provide 
accommodation, healthcare, and other basic 
needs, allowing workers to save and send 
money home to support their families.
However, it is true that there were isolated 
incidents involving unofficial recruitment 
channels, where a few individuals were 
reportedly misled and ended up being drawn 
into the conflict zone under the guise of 
employment. These were deeply unfortunate 
cases.
Since then, both the Sri Lankan and Russian</p>

governments have taken corrective action. 
Authorities have tightened oversight, and I can 
confidently assure you that such incidents no 
longer occur under official, legal pathways.
Today, employment opportunities are offered 
through regulated systems, overseen by 
Russian government institutions such as 
immigration and labor departments, ensuring 
transparency, legitimacy, and safety for foreign 
workers. We strongly advise all job seekers to 
use only verified recruitment channels to avoid 
exploitation.
Russia continues to welcome skilled Sri 
Lankan workers — especially in sectors like 
manufacturing, logistics, textile production, 
and courier services — and many companies 
report high satisfaction with their Sri Lankan 
employees, valuing their discipline, reliability, 
and work ethic.
What other activities and programs 
do you offer at the Russian Centre in 
Colombo?
One of our most popular programs is the 
Chess Classes for students. As you may know, 
chess holds a very special place in Russian 
culture and history. That legacy has sparked 
strong interest among Sri Lankan students. 
The classes we offer are well-structured, 
progressive, and taught with genuine passion 
— and it’s incredibly rewarding to see students 
so engaged in a game that sharpens both their 
intellect and focus.
We also offer Ballet Classes, which have 
become increasingly popular, especially among 
school-aged children and young adults. Our 
instructors bring the elegance, discipline, and 
technique of the Russian ballet tradition right 
here to Colombo. For many students, learning 
ballet is a journey into grace, strength, 
posture, and self-expression. They often share 
how it has improved not just their physical 
fitness, but also their confidence, poise, and 
mental clarity. It's a beautiful blend of art and 
wellness, and we’re proud to witness such 
enthusiasm from Sri Lankan youth.
These programs — along with our Russian 
language courses, film screenings, cultural 
festivals, and literary events — are part of our 
broader mission: to create a vibrant, inclusive 
space where Sri Lankans can explore the depth 
and diversity of Russian culture, while also 
discovering new dimensions of their own 
creativity and curiosity.
