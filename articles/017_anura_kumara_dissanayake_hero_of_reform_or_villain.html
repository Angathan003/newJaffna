R
ecently, President Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake appeared on the political 
program Sattana on Sirasa TV, where he 
patiently and responsibly answered questions 
from journalists for nearly three and a half 
hours—an unprecedented moment in the 
47-year history of Sri Lanka's executive 
presidency.
He faced the questions with calmness and 
complete self-confidence, free from any 
tension or discomfort. His natural composure, 
effortless grace, and body language—radiating 
a gentle, engaging warmth—were all hallmarks 
of his distinctive character. He presented a 
clear, data-backed picture of the country’s 
overall macroeconomic trends. But he didn’t 
stop there; he went on to share detailed 
insights, supported by accurate statistics and 
relevant examples.
Throughout the entire three-and-a-half-hour 
session, his voice remained steady, flawless, 
free from hesitation, stumbles, or pauses to 
search for words.
Among all eight individuals who held the 
presidency between 1978 and 2024, not one 
has ever appeared before the press this well-
prepared. Equally, none of his predecessors 
demonstrated such clarity and conviction in 
presenting a comprehensive reform agenda or 
showed the ability to structure their thoughts 
and express them with such coherence and 
fluency.
In that sense, it is evident that no one, either 
in the opposition or the ruling party today,

comes close to challenging Anura Kumara’s 
charismatic personality, distinctive leadership 
qualities, and exceptional communication 
skills.
Apart from hurling insults at the President, 
calling him names like ‘Anda Puluhan’ (Great 
Liar) and ‘Andhare’ (Court Jester), today’s 
opposition lacks the strength or vision to 
present any constructive programs to the 
electorate. It must be said that, in the past 
50 years, there has never been an opposition 
to this weak or this disconnected from the 
people.
The way this year’s May Day rallies were 
organized clearly highlighted the growing 
prominence of the NPP as a giant political 
force and, in stark contrast, the rapid decline 
and disintegration of parties like the SJB, SLFP, 
and SLPP.
Those like Sajith Premadasa, Namal Rajapaksa, 
Champika Ranawaka, and Dilith Jayaweera, 
who continue to spend their days dreaming 
of the presidency, remain far behind when it 
comes to matching the exceptional qualities 
demonstrated by Anura Kumara.
Fully aware of the reality that an immediate 
economic recovery with a substantial relief 
package for the people in the form of reduced 
cost of living and new job opportunities is 
not feasible, the government appears to be 
strategically focusing its attention on other 
sectors.
Within this context, the President has taken 
up the slogan: ‘We will root out corruption, 
bribery, waste, and malpractice from politics 
and the state machinery’. The government 
believes that this approach, though indirect, 
could eventually pave the way for economic 
recovery and sustainable development.
Bringing an end to the entrenched Politician–
Bureaucrat nexus—a system that has long 
operated as a collective looting mechanism—is</p>

the first step in this effort. As the President 
pointed out, it appears that this dismantling 
has already begun. However, fully eradicating 
the deeply rooted culture of bribery and 
corruption within the bureaucratic machinery 
will require a long and sustained effort.
The government’s next priority is to weaken 
and neutralize religious extremist forces by 
dismantling the so-called Rajapaksa legacy, 
which thrived on an aggressively racist agenda. 
A few prominent pro-government social 
media activists have already been strategically 
deployed for this purpose.
One of the most popular and influential 
YouTubers offering unwavering support to 
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake and 
the NPP government is Sudaththa Thilaksiri, 
popularly known as "Sudaa." It is widely 
believed that he operates with the tacit 
endorsement and backing of senior NPP 
leaders. (Many have also raised questions 
about the special police protection he is 
reportedly receiving from the government.)
He uploads at least four videos to his 
YouTube channel every day, either solo or in 
collaboration with another person.
In the Sinhala YouTube space, Sudaa’s archrival 
is Iraj Weeraratne, an outspoken loyalist of 
the Rajapaksas, particularly Namal Rajapaksa. 
It's no exaggeration to say he represents their 
camp online. The intense clashes between 
these two, though lacking in serious political 
discourse or reasoned debate, draw tens of 
thousands of viewers through their sharp 
insults, innuendos, and the use of Sinhala 
obscenities rarely uttered in the public sphere 
before.
“It is rather unfortunate that figures like 
Suddaththa Thilakasiri have risen to become 
a key influencer of the public opinion in this 
country... However, given the complexities of 
today’s social media-driven world, in a sense, it 
is inevitable,” says veteran leftist ideologue and 
political activist Deepthi Kumara Gunaratne.
It goes without saying that the severe 
criticisms directed at the NPP government by 
the opposition and anti-government YouTube 
channels cannot be countered individually 
by ministers or the over one hundred newly 
elected Members of Parliament. Most 
members of the government simply lack the 
communication training or the debating skills 
necessary to appear on visual media and 
effectively outsmart their opponents.
In a way, Suddaththa Thilakasiri plays a 
complementary role in this regard, acting 
almost as the government’s unofficial 
spokesperson in the digital space.
Complementing his efforts from another 
platform is Professor Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri 
of the University of Colombo, Department 
of History, who runs the YouTube channel 
History with Nirmal. From a pro-government 
standpoint, he analyzes contemporary political 
and social issues in Sri Lanka. He also attempts 
to provide both the ideological and practical 
contexts for the decisions and moves made by 
President Anura Kumara.
The virulent attacks launched by Sudaa’s 
YouTube channel targeting hardcore Sinhala 
nationalist elements at an unprecedented 
scale appear to have the implicit nod of the 
government.
In a video released during the Dalada 
Exposition, he praised the exemplary gesture 
shown by the Muslim community in Kandy 
by keeping city mosques open for the 
convenience of thousands of devotees. He used 
that opportunity, as well, to hurl severe verbal 
abuse targeting Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara 
Thero, whose extreme Sinhala-Buddhist outfit 
the Bodu Bala Sena has been on a warpath 
with the country’s Muslim minority since 
2012.</p>

In another viral video, Sudaa launched a 
scathing attack on the key players of the 
Dr. Shafi conspiracy, such as Athuraliye 
Rathana Thero, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya 
Gammanpila, and Channa Jayasumana, by 
referencing the A Level results of his daughter. 
It seems that a well-orchestrated effort is made 
to weaken religious extremists. 
Meanwhile, certain remarks made by 
Balangoda Kasappa Thero during Dan<br />
Priyasad’s condolence speech, where he 
accused Jihad extremists of being behind 
Dan’s killing, without presenting any evidence, 
has also drawn sharp criticism in the Sinhala 
social media circles.
In sum, these developments, although 
may seem unrelated, point to an emerging 
confrontation between hardline Sinhala-
Buddhist elements and the NPP government. 
That could escalate further in the coming 
months.
A leading Buddhist monk recently made the 
following remarks on a YouTube channel in 
a program titled The Victory of Malimawa 
means the Defeat of Sinhala Buddhists: 
“Appointing a Christian as the Minister in 
charge of the Buddha Sasana and Religious 
Affairs is not a coincidence. It was a calculated 
move. These individuals are not truly 
‘Niragamika’ (non-religious); While they 
respect all other religions in Sri Lanka, they 
deliberately demean Buddhism alone.
He further alleged: “For years, the Galduwa 
Aranya sacred site has been maintained and 
refurbished by the Sri Lankan Navy. However, 
this time when the request was made for such 
assistance, the Navy authorities responded 
by sending a letter stating that the required 
services can only be rendered subject to a 
payment of Rs. 93,000 per hour”.
In late March, a new Hall was inaugurated 
at the Thayiddi Tissa Vihara premises in 
Jaffna, reportedly affiliated to the Amarapura 
Chapter. During the religious ceremonies 
that followed, many military personnel were 
deployed for security and almsgiving duties, 
and a military band was also present. However, 
it is said that the army was abruptly withdrawn 
from the site, following a phone call from the 
Army Commander.
In response to this development, Wimal 
Weerawansa launched a scathing attack on the 
President during a press conference held in 
Colombo. One of the points he raised was: “A 
top-level Government leader has summoned 
the senior officials of the Department of 
Archaeology and issued a strict directive, to 
the effect that: ‘From now on, archaeological 
sites in the North and East should not be 
labeled as Buddhist or Hindu sites.' This 
directive will inevitably lead to future claims 
by Hindus over sites currently considered 
Buddhist heritage”.
Weerawansa also quoted two lines from a 
letter written by Dr. Pussellawel Somavisuddhi 
Mahanayaka Thero of the Amarapura Chapter, 
to the President:
“We opine that the Army Commander, 
someone who belongs to a different faith, 
should have acted with even greater caution in 
this matter.”
While the government has been handling  very 
sensitive issues with great caution, these two 
incidents also demonstrate that it is gradually 
taking steps to remove certain ‘problematic 
precedents’
President Anura Kumara’s mildly worded 
admission during the Sattana program—“We 
must accept that in the past, we have not 
addressed the problems of the Tamil people 
in a way that respects their sentiments. To 
be honest, we have mostly focused on the 
Sinhalese population”—can be seen as a</p>

remarkable shift in the thinking within the 
JVP camp.
In addition, following a few confusions related 
to the recent Dalada Sacred Tooth Relic 
Exposition, a series of attacks launched by 
the "Sudaa" YouTube channel targeting the 
Diyawadana Nilame (Chief Lay Custodian 
of the Temple of the Tooth) has now reached 
its peak. Sudaa has publicly accused the 
Diyawadana Nilame of misusing Temple funds 
and engaging in illegal financial transactions. 
He has also issued a warning, stating that he 
will present evidence to support these claims 
in the coming days. It is important to note that 
these criticisms are emerging at a crucial time 
- just months ahead of the upcoming election 
to appoint the next Diyawadana Nilame.
Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero, who 
had a strong presence in the country’s polity 
over the past 13 years by capitalizing on 
Islamophobia, perhaps for the first time is 
now facing a hostile government. In the recent 
press conference, his body language revealed 
noticeable tension and fear, which became 
apparent to close observers.
Sudaa has even issued a warning that he 
may be compelled to release certain videos 
related to the darker side of Gnanasara Thero. 
Whether the controversial monk could 
continue his usual practice of spreading 
unsubstantiated narratives about Islamic 
extremism in Sri Lanka, thereby stoking 
irrational fears among Sinhalese and tensions 
within the Muslim community, remains to be 
seen.
There is no doubt that the most significant 
challenges Anura Kumara Dissanayake 
currently faces include managing the 
economic crisis, handling of protests led 
by the "Anthare" (Inter-University Student 
Federation) led by Kumar Gunaratnam, and 
the protests organized by trade unions.
However, when it comes to minority 
communities, whether he will ultimately be 
seen as a Hero or a Villain, depends entirely on 
how he chooses to deal with the re-emerging 
forces of ethno-religious extremism in the 
country!</p>
