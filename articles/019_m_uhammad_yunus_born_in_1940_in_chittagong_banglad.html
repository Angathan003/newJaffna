M
uhammad Yunus, born in 1940 in 
Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a globally 
renowned economist and Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate who has dedicated his life to 
addressing poverty and empowering the poor. 
Yunus, a pioneer in the field of microfinance, 
is best known for founding the Grameen Bank 
in 1983, an institution that revolutionized 
the concept of providing small loans to those 
without collateral, particularly to women, to 
foster economic independence.
Academic and Early Career
Yunus's academic journey began at Dhaka 
University in Bangladesh and continued in 
the United States, where he earned a Ph.D. in 
economics from Vanderbilt University in 1969 
on a Fulbright scholarship. After a stint as an 
assistant professor at Middle Tennessee State 
University, Yunus returned to Bangladesh in 
1972, shortly after its independence, to lead 
the economics department at Chittagong 
University.
The devastating famine of 1974 profoundly 
impacted Yunus, steering him away from 
academic theories and towards practical 
solutions for the impoverished. His response 
was to offer small loans to the destitute, a 
move that eventually led to the founding of the 
Grameen Bank, transforming microfinance 
into a global tool for poverty alleviation.
The Grameen Bank and Microfinance 
Movement
Established in 1983, the Grameen Bank 
was driven by Yunus's belief that "credit is 
a fundamental human right." The bank's 
innovative model provided micro-loans to the 
poor, helping them start small businesses and 
achieve financial self-sufficiency. The success 
of Grameen Bank not only uplifted millions 
of Bangladeshis but also inspired similar 
initiatives in over 100 countries worldwide. 
Yunus's work earned him and the Grameen 
Bank the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.
Political Involvement and Challenges
Yunus's involvement in Bangladesh's political 
sphere has been marked by both ambition 
and controversy. In 2007, he attempted to 
enter politics by forming a political party, 
Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power), amid a 
state of emergency and political turmoil in 
Bangladesh. However, he abandoned these 
efforts due to a lack of popular support.
In 2010, Yunus and the Grameen Bank 
faced scrutiny following the release of the 
documentary Caught in Micro Debt, which 
criticized microloans and alleged financial 
improprieties. Although Yunus and the 
bank were cleared by Norwegian authorities, 
the Bangladesh government initiated an 
investigation that led to Yunus's removal 
as managing director of Grameen Bank in 
2011. Yunus contended that his dismissal 
was politically motivated, orchestrated by 
then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed, a 
longtime rival.
Literary Contributions and Global 
Recognition
Beyond his groundbreaking work in 
microfinance, Yunus is also a prolific author 
and thinker. His books, including Building 
Social Business and A World of Three Zeroes, 
outline his vision for a new kind of capitalism 
focused on social good rather than profit. 
Yunus has received numerous accolades for 
his contributions, including Bangladesh's 
Independence Day Award, the World Food 
Prize, and the U.S. Presidential Medal of 
Freedom.</p>
