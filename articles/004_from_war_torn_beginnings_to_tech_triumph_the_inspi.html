In an exclusive interview with the Jaffna 
Monitor, we delve into the remarkable 
journey of Dr Sabesan Sithamparanathan, 
Cambridge alumni, a notable figure in the 
tech world and the Founder &amp; President 
of the multimillion-dollar company 
PervasID, 
a 
Cambridge 
University 
spin-out and Fellow at Girton College 
Cambridge 
University. 
Dr. 
Sabesan 
is renowned for his ground-breaking 
innovation in a nearly 100% accurate 
battery-free real-time location tracking 
system, a technology extensively utilised 
across various sectors, including retail, 
healthcare, and aviation. 
His recent prestigious accolade, the 
OBE (Officer of the Order of the British 
Empire) award in the King's 2024 New 
Year Honours List, is a testament to his 
significant contributions and is often seen 
as a stepping stone towards the esteemed 
'Sir' title. Originating from the small town 
of Pallai in Kilinochchi in Sri Lanka, Dr 
Sabesan's early life was marked by the 
backdrop of intense ethnic conflict and 
the onset of civil war, having been born 
in 1984, just a year after the escalation 
of brutal ethnic violence in Sri Lanka. 
His transition from the challenging 
circumstances to the esteemed halls of 
Cambridge University is not just a story 
of personal success but an embodiment of 
indomitable spirit and resilience.
His journey from a young boy in 
war-torn Sri Lanka to a globally 
recognised tech leader exemplifies the 
transformative power of education. His 
story demonstrates that education is not 
just about gaining knowledge; it's a key to 
unlocking potential and driving societal 
progress. His hard work, dedication, and 
perseverance serve as an inspiration, 
proving that with access to education, 
any obstacle can be surmounted, and 
remarkable achievements are possible.
In conjunction with growing PervasID, 
Dr Sabesan has been advocating for the

Engineering and the Institution of Engineering 
and Technology (IET), and he was named in 
Business Elite's "40 Under 40" in 2023.
Join us as we explore the inspiring life story 
of Dr Sabesan Sithamparanathan, from his 
humble beginnings in war-torn Sri Lanka to 
his illustrious career in the United Kingdom.
How do you feel about receiving the 
OBE award recently? Could you also, 
explain the importance of the OBE 
for our readers who might not be 
completely aware of what it signifies?
Receiving the OBE, or Officer of the Order 
of the British Empire, marks an immensely 
prestigious moment for me, symbolising 
not just a personal achievement but also the 
collective hard work and innovative spirit of 
the entire PervasID team. This esteemed award, 
conferred by the British monarch, on the advice 
of the UK government, recognises individuals 
for their substantial contributions in various 
fields, including arts, science, charitable work, 
and public service.
I am honoured for my contributions to 
wireless 
technology 
and 
promotion 
of 
science, 
technology, 
engineering, 
and 
mathematics (STEM) subjects in education. 
The latter is particularly rewarding to me, as 
it also highlights my efforts to increase female 
participation in STEM fields. Receiving the 
OBE transcends a mere accolade; it embodies 
a profound responsibility. It inspires me to 
continue my pursuit of societal betterment and 
to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation. 
This honour reinforces my commitment to 
enhancing STEM education and fostering 
diversity within the technology sector. It's about 
paving the way for future generations, inspiring 
them to make meaningful contributions to 
their fields and society at large.
How did your childhood and 
upbringing shape your story of 
passion, resilience and determination?
I grew up in a middle-class family and faced a 
pivotal change in my life when I lost my father 
at the age of 10. We were living in Pallai at the 
time, and his passing forced us to relocate
to Chavakachcheri with the help of my 
grandmother and Periyamma (mother's elder 
sister). 
My academic journey wasn't smooth sailing 
from the start. I failed my 5th-grade scholarship 
exam, and throughout my early school years 
at Chavakachcheri Hindu College, I was not 
particularly a serious student as I was playing 
lots of cricket and other games in my early 
days, with no interest in being a successful</p>

student. Despite my aptitude 
for mathematics and science, 
my performance in other 
subjects 
was 
mediocre, 
often ranking towards the 
middle to bottom of my 
cohort. Cricket was my 
passion during those years. I 
occasionally skipped tuition 
classes to play cricket, where 
the winning team earned a 
tennis ball. 
However, a turning point 
came in the 8th standard 
when I became acutely aware 
of my family's financial 
situation. This realisation 
marked a drastic shift in my 
priorities. I gave up cricket, 
which I loved deeply, and 
other leisure activities like 
socialising with friends. I 
dedicated myself entirely to 
my studies. This laser focus 
paid off in my Ordinary 
Level (OL) exams, where I 
achieved 8 Distinctions and a Credit, the latter 
in English, which was a challenging subject for 
me.
After securing these results, I moved to Jaffna 
Hindu College for my Advanced Levels, 
choosing the Maths stream.
Reflecting on this later in life, particularly 
during a leadership program at Harvard 
University, I learned about the concept of 
'crucible moments' - pivotal experiences that 
shape a person's life. From Barack Obama to 
Steve Jobs, successful individuals have all faced 
such defining moments. For me, the loss of 
my father and the ensuing financial difficulties 
in my family served as my crucible moment, 
deeply influencing my path and achievements.
How did your experiences 
and memories as a student at 
Chavakachcheri Hindu College shape 
you into the person you are today?
My time at Chavakachcheri Hindu College 
played a foundational role in shaping who I am 
today. The teachers there were instrumental in 
our development, ensuring that we excelled not 
only academically but also in cultivating strong 
moral and ethical values. I fondly remember my 
class teachers Ravikumar sir and Nageswaran</p>

sir and, science teachers Rajalingam sir and 
Parameswaran sir, maths teacher Arudjothi 
Varnan sir, social/history teacher Sarveswaran 
sir and many others. Known for their strict 
discipline 
and 
teaching 
methods, 
they 
importantly instilled in us the values of honesty, 
integrity, and high moral standards. They were 
not just educators; they were role models, 
living examples of the virtues they taught. Their 
teachings have stayed with me throughout my 
life. For instance, when Nageswaran sir taught 
us epic pieces of literature like the Mahabharata 
and the Ramayana, he did so by interpreting 
these stories with real-life meanings. He drew 
parallels between these ancient narratives and 
contemporary life, emphasising the importance 
of honesty, moral and uprightness. The values 
of honesty, integrity, and moral fortitude that 
I learned there have been fundamental to 
my personal and professional development, 
significantly aiding me in both spheres of life.
Could you elaborate on your 
experiences and memories from your 
days at Jaffna Hindu College?
I joined Jaffna Hindu College after completing 
my Ordinary Level exams at Chavakachcheri 
Hindu College. I studied there for two years.
This period was crucial in shaping my 
academic aspirations, as it introduced me to 
a highly competitive environment. At Jaffna 
Hindu College, top-performing students, 
including myself, were grouped in the 'C' 
section classroom. This strategy of assembling 
bright students together was something I later 
observed at Cambridge University as well. It's 
a technique that enhances students' intellectual 
capacity and fosters a spirit of healthy 
competition. Jaffna Hindu College ignited a 
real desire in me to learn and compete.

The atmosphere there was uniquely conducive 
to focusing on studies. It helped me channel 
my energies towards achieving academic 
excellence.
However, I firmly believe that academic 
prowess alone isn't sufficient; good character 
development is equally vital. Likewise, having 
a good character without academic skills 
isn't enough either. Chavakachcheri Hindu 
College played a significant role in building my 
character, while Jaffna Hindu College honed my 
academic skills. I often reflect on my educational 
journey by saying that Chavakachcheri Hindu 
College gave me my heart, and Jaffna Hindu 
College gave me my brain. This combination of 
character and intellect has been pivotal in my 
overall development and success.
Did you attend tuition classes for your 
Advanced Level examinations? 
I attended tuition for my advanced-level 
examinations. For Physics, I studied from 
Kumaran sir; for Chemistry, it was Maniyam 
sir and Rajaram teacher (sadly passed away), 
and for Maths, my tutor was Senthilraj sir. 
These four teachers played a crucial role in my 
AL education, each contributing significantly 
to my understanding and proficiency in their 
respective subjects. My Maths and Physics skills
were key to my inventions later at Cambridge 
University, and I am most grateful to Kumaran 
Sir and Senthilraj Sir for laying the foundation
for me.
Could you share the story of how you 
ended up at Cambridge University?
My journey to Cambridge began with academic 
success in Sri Lanka. I achieved straight As in 
all three subjects in the Advanced Level exams</p>

in 2003 and enrolled at Moratuwa University, 
the country's top engineering university. As 
an Advanced Level student, I initially aimed 
to excel at Moratuwa. However, my ambitions 
grew while I was there; I became aware of 
globally esteemed institutions like Harvard, 
Cambridge, Oxford, MIT and Stanford, and I 
developed a strong  desire to join one of these 
prestigious universities. I wanted to get into 
one of these universities badly. I pursued every 
opportunity that came my way-applied to a 
few universities in the UK with help from my 
aunty's (mother's younger sister's) family in 
the UK. This led to a scholarship offer from 
the University of Sheffield. So, I took the risk of 
leaving Moratuwa and coming to the UK, ready 
to embrace the challenges and opportunities it 
presented.
At Sheffield, where I pursued a BEng (Hons) 
in Electronic Engineering from 2004 to 2007, 
I initially faced significant challenges with the
English language. I had completed my 
schooling in Tamil. Despite these obstacles, 
I remained focused on my goal of excelling 
academically to secure a place at Cambridge 
with a full scholarship. I was ranked 1 st in the 
department every year and was awarded the Sir 
William Siemens Medal in 2007 for being one 
of the country's top 18 science and technology 
students.
My efforts paid off when I was accepted into the 
University of Cambridge for an MPhil in 2007, 
under the supervision of Professor Ian White, 
with Cambridge Commonwealth Trust, Corpus 
Christi College Scholarship and EPSRC (TINA 
and Boeing) Studentship. At Cambridge,
I immersed myself in both academics and 
extracurricular activities. I was elected as 
the Sports Representative of the Middle 
Combination 
Room 
(MCR) 
at 
Corpus 
Christi College and also served as the cricket 
captain, reigniting my passion for the sport 
that I had set aside during my school years 
in Jaffna. Following my MPhil, I continued 
at Cambridge for my PhD in Electronic 
Engineering from 2008 to 2010 on the subject 
of 'Passive RFID real time sensing system 
for intelligent infrastructure'. Cambridge 
University represented more than just a place 
of learning for me; it was a transformative 
juncture that reshaped my life's path. The

University's distinguished history, marked by 
the achievements of 96 Nobel laureates, speaks 
volumes about its stringent academic standards 
and its ability to inspire. During my time there, 
Cambridge sharpened my focus, fuelled my 
passion, and deepened my drive and vision 
for success. In this environment, I realised my 
true potential, setting the groundwork for the 
successes that would follow in my career. I was 
also very fortunate to have had exceptional 
mentors here.
 As the Founder of PervasID and a 
key figure in developing innovative 
tracking technology, could you share 
with us your journey from academia to 
entrepreneurship? 
When I arrived at Cambridge University, my 
original ambition was to pursue a career in 
investment banking, primarily attracted by the
lucrative salaries offered by major firms such 
as J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley. These 
companies were known for offering starting 
salaries of around 60,000 pounds per year to 
fresh graduates, which was about twice what 
a newly qualified electronics engineer might 
expect to earn. 
However, a pivotal shift occurred during my 
PhD, sponsored by Boeing, where I tackled the 
airline industry's costly issue of lost luggage, 
responsible for around 400 million dollars in 
annual losses globally. This challenge led me to 
invent and develop the world's most accurate 
battery-free radio frequency identification 
(RFID) tracking solution, a solution that later 
became the basis for my company, PervasID.
My ground-breaking innovation described in 
my 300-page thesis, condensed into 100 pages, 
secured patent rights, marking my foray into 
entrepreneurship. As Founder &amp; President 
of PervasID, I successfully grew PervasID 
into a multimillion-dollar global enterprise, 
transforming multiple sectors, including retail, 
healthcare, industrial, logistics and supply 
chain. For instance, in healthcare, my solution 
enables the precise tracking of hospital assets to 
ensure that mission-critical medical devices are 
available at the right place and time for robust
and efficient care. The need for this level

of traceability of medical devices has been 
particularly 
evident 
in 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. The solution is predicted to save 
£billions for hospitals and will save lives.
This journey highlights the importance of 
adaptability and the willingness to explore new 
avenues, essential traits for any entrepreneur.
How did you navigate the unfamiliar 
territory of entrepreneurship? 
When I initially ventured into wireless 
technology and invented the world's most 
accurate battery-free tracking system, I was 
quite new to the world of entrepreneurship. 
The idea of turning an invention into a business 
venture was a foreign concept for me. I saw my 
invention as something that required nurturing 
and development, much lik n the Centre for 
Entrepreneurial Learning. These programs 
were invaluable, teaching me how to evolve a 
lab idea into a commercially viable business. 
I pursued funding and mentoring from the 
Royal Academy of Engineering's Enterprise 
Fellowship Scheme to spin my innovations out 
of the university lab and into a commercial 
endeavour, PervasID in 2011. However, my 
education in entrepreneurship continued well 
beyond that. 2018, I engaged in the Authentic 
Leader Development program at Harvard 
Business School and the SME Leaders Award 
program at the Royal Academy of Engineering. 
These programs refined my leadership skills.
In my opinion, with dedication and effort, any 
skill can be acquired, and Genius is not an 
inherent trait but the result of persistent hard 
work and commitment. When I began my 
company, I had two inventions.
Today, I am credited with five, which I see 
as a testament to the skill of inventing being 
honed over time and becoming a part of one's 
identity. This journey has taught me that 
entrepreneurial skills are not innate but can 
be learned and improved upon. It's a journey 
marked by continuous learning, adaptation, 
and striving for improvement, essential in my 
evolution from a PhD student to a technology 
entrepreneur.
How did being born and raised amidst 
the brutal war in Sri Lanka affect or 
shape you as a person?
The war had a profound impact on me. 
Just months before my Ordinary Level 
(OL) exams, our family was forced to leave 
Chavakachcheri due to the conflict and relocate 
to Vadamarachchi. Amidst this upheaval, I left 
behind all my study materials – notes, papers, 
and books. In Vadamarachchi, I relied on 
borrowing books and notes from friends to 
prepare for the exams. Despite these challenges, 
I managed to achieve good results.
Looking back, I realise that this experience, a 
direct consequence of the war was instrumental 
in shaping my character and resilience.
These qualities, forged in times of adversity, have 
continually influenced my life. The experience 
also instilled in me a certain bravery and the 
ability to face and overcome challenges.
Life would likely have been more straightforward 
if I had continued my studies at Moratuwa 
University. I could have settled in Jaffna with a
government job. However, I chose a different 
path filled with risks and uncertainties. For 
instance, I was not fluent in English when I 
came to the UK. But, similar to my experiences 
during the war, I viewed this language barrier 
as a challenge to overcome, not a setback. The</p>

resilience I developed during the war years 
was invaluable. It taught me to face adversities 
head-on and to persist despite difficulties. This 
mindset significantly influenced my ability 
to adapt to new environments, pursue higher 
education abroad, and eventually succeed in 
my professional endeavours. 
What are your current initiatives for 
giving back to the Jaffna society, and 
could you elaborate on the specific 
projects you've started or are planning 
to initiate?
I am currently engaged in two main initiatives 
in Jaffna. The first is titled 
'Realising Your Potential at an 
Early Stage and Achieving Success'. 
I firmly believe that every child is 
born with innate talents, and in 
this, I don't think the divine has 
shortchanged anyone. The crux of 
the issue is that many children do 
not get the opportunity to discover 
and nurture these talents. It's the 
fortunate 1% who, either by chance 
or guidance, realise their potential 
early and go on to make history. 
However, this doesn't mean the 
rest cannot achieve similar feats. 
Figures like Steve Jobs, Sir Isaac 
Newton, Bill Gates, and many 
other notable achievers realised 
their true potential early in life, 
which was crucial to their success. 
Therefore, I've initiated programs 
in Sri Lanka to help students 
discover and cultivate their innate 
abilities from an early age.
My second project focuses on 
mentoring 
aspiring 
entrepreneurs. 
This 
initiative is in collaboration with Jaffna 
University. We aim to support talented 
individuals with innovative ideas or inventions 
but lack the know-how to transform these into 
successful entrepreneurial ventures.
By providing mentorship, we hope to guide 
them to becoming successful entrepreneurs. 
My vision is for Jaffna University to become a 
breeding ground for entrepreneurs, emulating 
the culture of innovation and enterprise 
fostered by leading universities like Cambridge 
and Harvard. Through these efforts, I hope to 
contribute to a future where Jaffna and its youth 
play a pivotal role in shaping a progressive and 
innovative society.</p>
