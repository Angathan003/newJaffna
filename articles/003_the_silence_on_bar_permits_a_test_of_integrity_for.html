The Silence on Bar Permits-A Test of 
Integrity for the New Government
A
s the first month of Anura Kumara Dissanayake's 
presidency draws to a close, the expectations 
surrounding Sri Lanka's first non-elite head of state 
remain both profound and unrelenting. His rise to power was 
lauded as a decisive rupture from the entrenched political 
oligarchies that have long monopolized control over the 
nation's governance. Dissanayake's electoral platform was 
built on a foundation of promises—chief among them a radical 
transformation of the political landscape through transparency, 
institutional reform, and unwavering accountability, particularly 
in addressing the endemic corruption that has permeated 
successive administrations.
One of the key pledges made by Anura and his coalition, 
particularly to the northern electorate, was the exposure of those 
who benefited from the reckless issuance of bar permits under 
previous administrations. It is a well-known fact that a number 
of Tamil nationalist politicians—often vocal about their moral 
rectitude and commitment to Tamil nationalism—were among 
the beneficiaries.
During his campaign trail across Northern Sri Lanka, 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake resolutely pledged to unmask 
the hypocrisy of these figures and publicly expose their 
misdeeds. However, one month into his presidency, the 
promised disclosure of names remains conspicuously absent. 
This prolonged silence casts a shadow of doubt over the 
government's true intentions. It compels us to question whether 
the new administration, much like its predecessors, has fallen 
prey to the seductive allure of political opportunism, perhaps 
safeguarding these individuals to secure future alliances or to 
gain strategic political leverage.
The political dynamics at play cannot be ignored. The NPP 
and JVP had little presence in the North prior to the recent

presidential election. In the 
2019 election, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake received only 1,375 
votes in the Jaffna electoral district-
an insignificant 0.37% of the 
vote. However, in the most recent 
election, that number soared to 
27,086, a significant 7.29% of the 
total votes.
This remarkable increase signals the 
disillusionment of northern voters 
with decades of corrupt governance, 
and their hope that Anura's 
presidency would bring a much-
needed clean slate to Sri Lankan 
politics. Should this hope prove 
to be a mere illusion, the political 
capital the NPP has built in this 
region will quickly disintegrate.
It is particularly telling that ITAK 
MP M.A. Sumanthiran has been 
more vocal than the government 
itself in demanding the release of 
these names. While Sumanthiran 
undoubtedly has his own political 
motivations—especially given the 
widespread belief that his intra-
party rival, Sritharan, is one of the 
beneficiaries of the bar permits—his 
argument cannot be easily dismissed. 
His relentless demands highlight 
the central contradiction of the 
current administration: How can a 
government elected on the platform 
of eradicating corruption remain 
silent on such a crucial issue?
Speculation is rife that the 
government may be delaying the 
release of these names until the 
parliamentary election, scheduled 
for November 14th, using the 
issue as political leverage. 
Alternatively, some fear that the 
administration may be concealing 
the names altogether. Such a lack 
of transparency strikes at the very 
core of the government's mandate. If 
the promises of accountability and 
reform are to be taken seriously, the 
public must see decisive action soon.
The people of Sri Lanka placed 
their faith in this administration to 
cleanse the political landscape of its 
entrenched corruption. The failure 
to deliver on such a fundamental 
promise could be catastrophic for the 
NPP, eroding the trust and goodwill 
it has worked to build. The integrity 
of the Anura administration is now 
on trial, and the outcome will be 
determined by its ability to rise 
above the political calculations that 
have derailed so many governments 
before it.
The question remains: Will this 
government live up to its promises 
and reveal the truth, or will it 
become yet another chapter in Sri 
Lanka's long history of unfulfilled 
political vows? Time will tell, but 
the silence is already deafening.
