I
n Jaffna, Sri Lanka, there exists a deep-
seated yearning among its youth for what 
is believed to be a better life in Canada, a 
narrative that has become almost as common 
as the waves lapping its shores. However, 
this dream has also given rise to a murky 
underbelly of exploitation and false promises. 
This is highlighted in a recent incident 
involving a young man from Jaffna and a 
fraudulent individual posing as a journalist. 
The allure of Canada, long perceived as a 
dreamland by Sri Lankan Tamils and known 
for its relatively accessible visa policies for Sri 
Lankans in recent times, has transformed into 
an almost feverish aspiration. Reports suggest 
that in the past year alone, approximately 
20,000 youths from the North—an estimated 
unverified—have made their way to Canada on 
various visas. Fueling this exodus is a booming 
visa industry, with the going rates ranging 
from a staggering 65 lakhs to 1.5 crores for 
a visiting visa. The youths of Jaffna, both 
employed and unemployed, are willing to pay

Monitor Memo
Exploitation of Jaffna's Youth in 
Pursuit of Overseas Dreams

these sums despite the lack of any guarantee of 
securing permanent residency upon arrival in 
Canada.
The recent arrest in Jaffna of a man who 
exploited these dreams vividly illustrates the 
themes of desperation and deceit. Posing as a 
journalist, the man tricked a local young man 
with promises of attending a major music 
event in Canada featuring the renowned 
Indian music director Santosh Narayanan. The 
youth, who had no connections to journalism, 
was misled by the con artist who claimed he 
could obtain a journalistic ID for him. This 
ID, the con artist reportedly promised, would 
facilitate his travel to Canada under the guise 
of covering Santosh Narayanan's music event. 
In exchange for this promise, the con man 
extorted 4.3 million rupees and provided a 
fake journalist identity card as part of the 
agreement.
As days turned into weeks with no sign of 
the promised event, the young man, realizing 
the deceit, sought to reclaim his money, 
only to find the fraudster had vanished. 
The police, upon receiving the complaint, 
launched a thorough investigation, leading 
to the discovery that the suspect was hiding 
in Vavuniya and that the purported media 
company was a sham-operated by the fraudster 
himself.
This incident underscores the dire straits in 
which many Sri Lankan youths find themselves 
willing to risk everything for a chance at life 
abroad. It also sheds light on the troubling 
exploitation by those who prey on these 
dreams, turning hope into despair. As the 
economic and political landscapes in Sri Lanka 
continue to challenge its people, the youth, 
who represent the future of the nation, are 
caught in a crossfire of hope and desperation. 
They are continually searching for their own 
slice of peace and prosperity, however elusive it 
may seem.</p>

Political Dynamics in Shanthan's Case: 
I
n a recent Facebook post, 
Mathisutha, the brother of the 
late Shanthan, also known as T. 
Suthenthirarajah—a former convict 
in the assassination case of Prime 
Minister Rajiv Gandhi—expressed 
an indirect criticism towards 
certain Tamil nationalist politicians. 
He specifically acknowledged 
the crucial support his family 
received from three politicians: 
S. Shritharan, the newly elected 
president of Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi; Douglas Devananda,

the fisheries minister and leader of 
the Eelam People's Democratic Party 
(EPDP); and Angajan Ramanathan, a 
Jaffna parliamentarian from the Sri Lanka 
Freedom Party.
Mathisutha emphasized the unwavering 
support these individuals provided, 
especially to his mother, which included 
24-hour contact availability. He 
highlighted that, despite some reluctance 
to openly discuss his brother's case due to 
potential diplomatic tensions with India, 
these politicians prioritized humanitarian 
assistance over political concerns.
Neutral observers have criticized leaders 
of the Tamil National People's Front 
(TNPF), including Gajendrakumar 
Ponnambalam, Selvarajah Kajendran, 
Sugash Kanagaratnam, and others, for 
allegedly using Shanthan's death to further 
their political motives. According to these 
observations, these TNPF politicians, who 
reportedly did not contribute to efforts for 
Shanthan's release or the repatriation of 
his remains, are accused of manipulating 
his death for political rallies in Sri Lanka. 
This action has been perceived as the 
embodiment of distasteful politics. 
In Mathisutha's post, he explicitly acknowledges 
the genuine assistance provided by Sritharan, 
Douglas Devananda, and Angajan Ramanathan 
in his brother's case. Mathisutha's message is 
perceived by some as a subtle rebuke of the 
TNPF leaders, highlighting the irony in their 
actions compared to the true support his family 
received.
The actions of the TNPF leaders, which have 
been characterized as opportunistic, seem 
to have diminished the earnest efforts of the 
politicians who genuinely supported the family 
in a crucial time. At this point, Mathisutha's 
subtle yet powerful criticism underscores the 
contrast between the genuine aid provided by 
some and the self-serving motives of others.
