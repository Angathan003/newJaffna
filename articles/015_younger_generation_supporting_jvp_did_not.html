altogether. It's a foolish decision, and the party 
should reconsider it. The SLPP needs to reach 
out, mend fences, and bring people back into 
the fold. Otherwise, it will struggle to rise 
again.
The SLPP has announced that Mahinda 
Rajapaksa will campaign nationwide 
for his son Namal. What's your take on 
that?
The SLPP owes much of its success to 
President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the leader who 
built the party into what it is today. But let's be 
realistic—The political landscape has shifted, 
and the younger generation, in particular, is 
unlikely to rally behind someone of his age. 
While his legacy is undeniable, the party must 
strategically consider its future. We can't rely 
on President Mahinda Rajapakse to achieve 
what he once did.
How much of the vote do you think 
Namal Rajapaksa might secure in the 
upcoming presidential election?
When it comes to elections, nothing is 
ever certain, so it's not wise to give specific 
numbers.
I heard an interesting story about 
you—that you were the Chairman 
of Paranthan Chemicals Company 
and that you had a close connection 
with the Tamil community during 
your tenure. Could you share your 
experiences during that time?
Yes, I had the privilege of serving as the 
Chairman of Paranthan Chemicals Company 
for five and a half years. During that period, 
from the end of 1977 until the end of 1983, 
I was based in Paranthan and lived there. If 
someone were to ask me what the best period 
of my life was, I would say without hesitation 
that it was during those years. I was incredibly 
happy.
Could you share some memories?
When I took over the company, it was 
struggling, operating at a loss, and resources 
were scarce. We faced numerous challenges, 
but through the collective effort of our team, 
we managed to turn things around and 
transform it into a profit-making entity, albeit 
with modest gains.
What struck me the most was the unwavering 
dedication of our Tamil employees, who 
made up 99% of the workforce—I was the 
sole exception. Their commitment to the 
organization was profound, and they took 
immense pride in their work. I never had to 
worry about the well-being of the company 
because these employees were both responsible 
and cooperative, never doing anything to 
jeopardize the organization.
We did face a month-long strike, but it 
was a matter of principle for the workers. 
Unfortunately, the then-Minister, Cyril 
Mathew, disagreed with their demands, 
creating a significant challenge. Had I been 
granted the freedom to make independent
