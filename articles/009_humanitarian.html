N
iththilan (name changed), a former 
United Nations worker of extraordinary 
courage, witnessed the harrowing final chapter 
of Sri Lanka's war in 2009. As one of the few 
who can bear witness to the unspeakable 
atrocities committed by both the Sri Lankan 
government and the LTTE, he played a 
pivotal role during the conflict's closing 
stages. In September 2008, following the 
evacuation directive for UN and international 
humanitarian organizations from LTTE-
controlled territories, Niththilan was thrust 
into a critical position. Appointed as the officer 
in charge of all UN operations in the region, 
he navigated the chaos, leading the mission 
and directing local staff amidst the absence 
of his international colleagues. Now, living in 
Europe, Niththilan has chosen to break his 
silence, sharing his untold story with 'Jaffna 
Monitor'—under the veil of anonymity.
What other atrocities related to 
forced enlistment by the LTTE did you 
witness?
Many atrocities could fill a thousand-page 
book, but one incident remains vividly etched 
in my memory. It took place in the Mathalan 
area, right across from the UN complex. 
Opposite our complex was the Mathalan 
hospital, and next to it, the Tamil Eelam police 
had an office in a house. The notorious child 
abductor Kannathasan lived and operated 
from there.
The Tamil Eelam police were deeply involved 
in the abduction of children, and every 
day, desperate parents flocked to the house,

weeping and begging for 
their children's release. 
Their cries of anguish 
echoed through the area, 
a constant reminder of the 
suffering inflicted upon 
them. One day, an elderly 
man, around 65 years 
old, arrived at the police 
house. He was visibly 
weak, his face etched with 
exhaustion and sorrow. 
His voice cracked as he 
cried loudly, pleading 
for the release of his only 
daughter, who had been 
taken by the LTTE the day 
before.
An argument broke out 
between the LTTE guards 
and the old man. The 
guards, cold and unfeeling, 
tried to push him away. 
But in a desperate act of 
defiance, the old man 
threw a bicycle chain 
cover at a female LTTE 
guard who was shoving 
him. What happened next 
was nothing short of a 
war crime and a crime 
against humanity. All the 
LTTE guards, both male 
and female, descended 
upon that frail old man 
with sticks, rods, and 
poles. They beat him 
viciously, their blows 
fueled by a merciless rage. 
His cries of pain were 
heart-wrenching, and I 
could feel my own heart 
breaking as I watched, 
powerless to intervene.
The beating left him nearly dead, and they dragged his half-
conscious body to the adjacent hospital. Before leaving, they 
warned the doctors not to treat him. Despite the danger, our 
brave doctors chose to act with compassion and humanity. They 
provided him with the treatment he so desperately needed. 
Yet, deep down, I knew that the old man would not survive the 
brutal assault. The image of his broken body and the sounds of 
his suffering haunt me to this day
How did Sri Lankan Tamil parents manage to hide and 
protect their children from being forcibly abducted by 
the LTTE?
For Sri Lankan Tamils, children are everything, and protecting 
them from the LTTE's forced abductions was an incredibly 
difficult struggle. Many parents resorted to marrying off their 
children at a young age, hoping this would provide some 
protection. In some cases, daughters would wear their mothers' 
Thali (a sacred necklace symbolizing marital status and respect</p>

in Tamil culture) and pretend to be married.
Every household had a hiding place, often a 
small, inconspicuous hole inside the house. No 
matter where they went, they would create a 
secret spot to conceal their children. Parents 
would hide their children in petrol barrels, 
diesel barrels, or any other hidden places they 
could find. I know that in every house, there 
was a hiding place for children. All my relatives 
had one. The ingenuity and determination 
of these parents were extraordinary as they 
fought to keep their children safe from the 
brutal abduction teams of the LTTE.
I remember one heartbreaking incident 
involving a Grama Niladhari from 
Vadamarachchi, Alaiyavalai, at the beginning 
of the last Eelam war in 2007. He was 
transferred to the Vanni region and had one 
son and one daughter. His daughter was very 
young, while his son was around 16 years old. 
Fearing that the LTTE would forcibly enlist 
his son, he hid him masterfully. One day, he 
received a letter from the LTTE demanding 
that he enlist his son. Despite the dire warning 
that hiding his son was a crime, he continued 
to keep him hidden, refusing to surrender his 
child to the mindless motives of the LTTE.
The LTTE's patience wore thin. They 
eventually took the Grama Niladhari in 
a jeep to the war front in the Muhamalai 
region, where the fighting was intense and the 
shelling relentless. He was forced to dodge live 
shelling and constant gunfire, each explosion 
shaking his resolve and filling him with dread. 
Under this immense pressure and terror, his 
determination to keep his son hidden began to 
crumble. The LTTE threatened him with death 
and worse if he did not comply.
In a moment of unbearable desperation, he 
lost his resolve and revealed his son's hiding 
place. The militants went back and dragged the 
boy out, forcibly enlisting him into their ranks. 
The father's heart shattered as he watched his 
son, whom he had tried so hard to protect, 
being taken away. His and his family's screams 
of protest and the boy's cries for help echoed 
hauntingly, but there was nothing he could do.
Tragically, the boy was dead within two 
months, a casualty in the Forward Defence 
Line (FDL). The news of his son's death broke 
him completely.
I met the Grama Niladhari in Manik Farm in 
Vavuniya. He looked like a living corpse, his 
eyes hollow and devoid of life, bearing the 
immense pain of having been forced to betray 
his own son due to LTTE coercion.
In one instance, an acquaintance of mine 
pretended to be mentally retarded to evade 
forced conscription. Thankfully, he escaped 
enlistment and now lives abroad. 
Within families, disputes often arose about 
who should join the LTTE, but no one wanted 
to enlist voluntarily. Those who genuinely 
desired to fight had already joined the LTTE 
long ago. The remaining individuals were 
unwilling to take up arms.
Given the LTTE's utter foolishness and lack 
of strategy, why would these people sacrifice 
their children? What logic is there in that? 
The LTTE leadership lacked political acumen, 
foresight, and diplomacy. Why would 
anyone expect parents to give their children 
to the LTTE's madness? In the last war, the 
majority of parents questioned why they 
should sacrifice their children for the LTTE's 
irrational, foolish actions. In the final months 
of the war, I'm sure no Tamil in the war zone 
supported the LTTE or its armed struggle.
Did the LTTE really use Tamil people 
as human shields, or as a few Tamil 
politicians claim, did these people 
choose not to leave the LTTE and stay 
in the war zone?</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

The LTTE's use of the general public as human 
shields wasn't a desperate measure adopted in 
the final war—it was a long-standing, ruthless 
strategy. Long before the last war, when the 
LTTE controlled Jaffna before 1995, they were 
already employing this grim tactic. Civilians 
were constantly caught in the crossfire, their 
lives used as pawns in a brutal game.
The LTTE leadership demonstrated time and 
again that they had no respect whatsoever for 
Tamil lives. They saw civilians not as people to 
protect but as tools to further their agenda.
In fact, when the LTTE introduced travel 
passes, they started using Tamil civilians as 
human shields. That is the truth. Without 
restrictions, the LTTE knew with absolute 
certainty that the people would leave them and 
they would be finished in a few weeks or even 
days.
The harsh yet absolute truth is that the LTTE 
never wanted to fight the Sinhala army alone; 
they always wanted to fight while keeping 
Tamil civilians as human shields. In the last 
war, no one wanted to stay with the LTTE. 
Every civilian, including the families of LTTE 
fighters, wanted to leave. People began to 
escape, and without any shame or regret, the 
LTTE leadership gave the order to shoot those 
who tried to flee the war zone.
I remember attending a meeting in the second 
week of February 2009 in the Mathalan area. 
This meeting with the general public was 
attended by Soosai, the Sea Tiger head, and 
Nadesan, the LTTE's political head. I recall 
Nadesan saying, "I have ordered to shoot those 
who escape the war zone. Whoever escapes 
the war zone is a traitor to the Tamil Eelam. 
They are leaving because they don't believe 
in the Tamil struggle." He shamefully later 
surrendered to the military with a white flag. 
What followed is well known.
Soosai gave a fiery speech, declaring that the 
innocent Tamils fleeing LTTE-held areas 
were traitors and shamelessly boasting that 
he rewarded those who shot at the escaping 
people. Yet, in May 2009, he brazenly sent his 
wife and children in a Sea Tigers boat, guarded 
by the Sea Tigers, to escape the war zone with 
lots of money and gold. This blatant hypocrisy 
and betrayal highlight the LTTE leadership's 
utter disregard for the very people they 
claimed to protect.
Soosai ordered hundreds of shootings of 
those trying to escape the war zone. Under 
his command, his Sea Tigers shot and killed 
hundreds of innocent Tamils who were 
desperately fleeing. Yet, he had the audacity to 
send his wife and children in a Sea Tigers boat, 
protected by his own forces. This is the most 
brutal betrayal anyone could inflict on the 
Tamil community: protecting his own family 
while thousands of innocent people died in the 
war zone.
This betrayal is not just a mere act of 
hypocrisy; it is a profound and heart-
wrenching act of treachery. Imagine the 
anguish of families who were forced to stay, 
facing relentless shelling and gunfire, while 
the leaders who proclaimed their undying 
dedication to the Tamil cause quietly ensured 
the safety of their own loved ones.
In one incident, a good number of the LTTE 
leaders sent their sons and daughters out of the 
war zone by hiding them in a UN convoy that 
came to the war zone in April 2009. Remember 
one thing: while the majority of the LTTE's 
leaders died in battle or after surrendering to 
the Sri Lankan army, most of these leaders' 
children somehow escaped the war zone and 
now live comfortably in foreign countries. That 
is not the case with the innocent Tamils. This 
duplicity laid bare the LTTE leadership's true 
priorities. They were willing to let thousands of 
innocent people die in the war zone while they 
secured their own families' safety.</p>

How many Tamils were shot and killed 
by the LTTE while attempting to escape 
the war zone?
The LTTE opened fire indiscriminately, 
without regard to age or gender, on those who 
tried to escape the war zone. In my estimation, 
before I escaped the war zone in April 2009, at 
least 300-400 people were killed by the LTTE 
while trying to flee, including infants, children, 
and the elderly. The LTTE ensured there was 
no breach in their human shield.
In one particularly harrowing incident, a group 
of desperate people tried to escape in broad 
daylight through Nandhi Kadal. Among them 
was a father carrying his 3-year-old daughter 
on his shoulders. I witnessed an LTTE fighter 
shoot the girl in her leg. Overcome with anger, 
I confronted him, asking why he shot the little 
girl instead of her father. Even though shooting 
the father would have been equally abhorrent, 
I questioned his cruel choice. His callous 
reply still haunts me: "If I shot her father, they 
might abandon him and leave. But they can't 
abandon a child. They all have to come back."
How can anyone expect people to stay with the 
LTTE when there was no food, no shelter, and 
indiscriminate shelling from the army?
There was one incident that involved me 
personally. In the last phase of the war, an 
ICRC ship arrived with food and medicine, 
and an international staff member named 
Julian, an old friend of mine, came along with 
the ship. He disembarked and came to the 
seashore, where approximately 1,000 Tamil 
civilians encircled him.
Before that day, a large number of people had 
tried to escape from the LTTE-controlled 
Mathalan to the Chundikulam area, and 
the Tigers opened fire on them, resulting in 
many deaths. I saw the bodies of three young 
children from that incident. The people 
encircled Julian and demanded that the ICRC 
evacuate them, or else they wouldn't let Julian 
leave. They also brought the bodies of the 
civilians who were shot dead by the LTTE in 
the previous night's escape attempt.
The situation was tense. I had no choice but to 
inform my office in Vavuniya from my satellite 
phone that Julian was essentially being held by 
the civilians. Our UN office then informed the 
ICRC, who in turn informed the Norwegian 
embassy. The Norwegian ambassador spoke 
with Nadesan. Soon after, 100 LTTE guards 
arrived, fully armed. They brutally beat the 
civilians and arrested them. I later heard that 
the civilians leading the protest were beaten to 
death by the LTTE.
Did you meet Julian again?
No, he did not come back to Mathalan. He was 
kept hostage for almost three hours. 
Did people beat him?
No, they treated him respectfully but 
confiscated all the communication sets. 
However, they beat a national staff member 
of the ICRC, claiming he had mistranslated to 
Julian. 
Did the ICRC report this incident?
No. The ICRC has a policy of non-interference. 
They see all the atrocities but don't report 
them. That is their policy.
Many people have mentioned in casual 
conversations that one of the reasons 
for the LTTE's defeat was Charles 
Antony, Prabhakaran's son. What is 
your assessment of him?
Yes, that's a valid observation. Although I have 
never met him or personally interacted with 
him, and I don't have much knowledge about 
his military capabilities, I was deeply saddened 
and angered by one of his actions.</p>

In the Northern Province, the Tamil 
Rehabilitation Organization (TRO), 
a humanitarian arm of the LTTE, 
operated with remarkable success and 
dedication. They were the first responders 
to any calamity in the northern region, 
providing many excellent services with 
limited resources. For 20-25 years, they 
did excellent work, and no one should 
have any doubt about that.
Suddenly, the LTTE started a new arm 
called Uthavum Karangal (Helping 
Hands) to do the same work TRO 
had been doing. Charles Antony was 
appointed as its head. This new arm 
was established when the war was at its 
peak, around November or December 
2008. It's important to note that the 
TRO was functioning very well, and 
there was no need for a new arm. 
However, Prabhakaran formed this new 
organization to give his son a role to play.
I don't believe Charles Antony had any 
real understanding of rehabilitation. He 
gathered around 100 youths and, despite 
the severe shortages during the peak of 
the war, provided them all with T-shirts 
bearing the name "Uthavum Karangal." 
He was granted many resources that the 
TRO was denied, including numerous 
tractors and lorries. In an LTTE-held 
area, no one could refuse Prabhakaran's 
son. As a result, he had access to many 
such resources and essentially played with 
them like toys.
My understanding is that he suddenly felt 
the need to open a humanitarian arm, 
so his father obliged and provided him 
with the necessary resources. This move 
deeply disappointed many dedicated TRO 
workers and other aid workers, including 
myself. Many TRO workers shared the</p>

same sentiment with me, but how could 
anyone living in an LTTE-controlled area 
question the choices of its leader? So, we stayed 
silent.
How did you feel when you learned 
that Prabhakaran was dead and the 
LTTE's armed struggle came to a brutal 
end?
When this happened, we were out of Manik 
Farm, a displacement camp in Vavuniya. 
As a long-time resident of the Vanni region 
who knew the terrain and the capabilities of 
the LTTE, I was certain that this outcome 
was inevitable. When Kilinochchi fell to the 
army, I knew that the LTTE was going to be 
vanquished in the most brutal way.
The LTTE took up arms to fight against the 
government, so perishing or winning is an 
expected fate for a militant group. However, 
they had no right to drag innocent Tamils into 
the jaws of war. In the final days of the conflict, 
the LTTE had no fighters and no proper arms; 
it was like a hermit kingdom, abandoned 
by everyone, including the international 
community. No international body recognized 
the LTTE, and no countries attempted to 
protect them. The LTTE fought a mindless war 
on their own.
I never liked Prabhakaran's politics, his 
dictatorship, monopoly, and his belief that only 
he should lead the struggle. However, he was 
undeniably a true warrior. If he had wanted 
to escape the war zone or ensure his family's 
escape, he had multiple ways to do so, but he 
did not. He did not even attempt to save any 
members of his family. He let everyone perish 
in the war. I believe he thought, "I started this 
war; let it end with me," so he stayed in the war 
zone until the very end.
A close ally of Prabhakaran, whom I later met 
in Switzerland, told me that Prabhakaran had 
said, "I am responsible for the suffering our 
Tamil community endures. If I die fighting, 
the Sri Lankan army must capture my body 
and identify it as mine so they will leave my 
people alone, allowing them to live peacefully." 
I believe this is why Prabhakaran stayed and 
why his body was recovered.
In reality, the pre-forced enlistment era of the 
LTTE's war was a golden period; I could say 
it was heaven on earth. Every time we passed 
the Omanthai point to enter LTTE-held 
areas, I felt like I was entering heaven. That 
feeling of self-rule and self-determination is 
indescribable. There were no worries and no 
fear; women could roam freely in the middle 
of the night. Regardless of high petrol prices 
or a lack of electricity, for me and many 
others, it was heaven on earth. Even though 
we understood the shortcomings in terms of 
human rights and the inability to speak against 
the LTTE, we cherished that life.
Despite having the qualities of a dictator, 
Prabhakaran ensured that everyone in his 
territory could live with dignity and peace, 
although this scenario changed drastically in 
the final war.
What troubles me is that those who now claim 
to be tigers and tiger supporters and proudly 
beat the drums of the LTTE's legacy are not 
willing to light a candle for the person who, 
despite his wrongdoings, perished with his 
entire family and fought with his last bullet 
and last fighter for a cause he completely 
believed in. This is sad and makes me furious.
