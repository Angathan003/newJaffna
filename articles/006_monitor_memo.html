N
orthern Province 
Governor N. Vethanayagan 
emphasized the need to protect 
farmers from exploitation by 
middlemen and to ensure fair 
market prices for their produce. 
He also announced plans to 
reopen economic centers in the 
province this year to address 
these critical issues.
The Governor made these 
remarks during the paddy 
harvesting festival and farmer 
recognition ceremony organized 
by the Maravanpulavu Farmers' 
Association. The event was held 
at the Maravanpulavu Sakalakalavalli School 
on Monday morning.
In his keynote address, Governor 
Vethanayagan highlighted the impact of 
climate change on agriculture: "Climate 
change has become a significant challenge for 
farmers. In the past, paddy harvesting seasons 
were not disrupted by rain. However, we 
now face erratic weather patterns that affect 
farming operations. Last November, despite 
heavy rains over a few days, we were fortunate 
to avoid substantial paddy losses. These rains, 
combined with the current weather, have left 
fields waterlogged, which farmers can use to 
their advantage."
The Governor encouraged farmers to diversify 
by cultivating minor millets after completing 
their paddy harvests. He assured them that the 
Department of Agriculture, through the Chief 
Secretary, has initiated measures to provide 
seeds for these crops.
"While other districts in the Northern 
Province rely on irrigation for dual cropping 
seasons, Jaffna depends entirely on rainfall and 
is limited to one cropping season. By adapting 
to the current climatic changes, farmers can 
cultivate minor millets and increase their 
income."
He also called for a forward-thinking approach 
to agriculture, emphasizing the importance of 
aligning crop production with the region's soil 
suitability and export potential. The Governor 
assured farmers that the Department of 
Agriculture would support the implementation 
of these strategies.

From Fishing 
Village to Global 
Hub: How Shenzhen 
Conquered Urban 
Growth and 
Pollution
Jaffna Monitor in Shenzhen
I 
found myself standing amidst a 
forest of gleaming skyscrapers, 
their glass facades shimmering in 
the sunlight and bustling tech hubs 
that seemed to defy gravity. This 
was Shenzhen—the "Silicon Valley 
of China." It was hard to believe 
that just a few decades ago, this 
sprawling, futuristic metropolis had 
been nothing more than a sleepy 
fishing village with a population 
of merely 28,000. It felt like a story 
lifted straight from the pages of a 
science fiction novel.
Locals told me that back in 
the early 1980s, Shenzhen was 
a modest settlement, with life 
revolving around rickety fishing 
boats bobbing along the shoreline 
and a handful of simple homes 
scattered across the landscape. 
The population at the time was</p>

just a few lakhs. Today, with over 20 million 
residents, Shenzhen boasts thousands of 
towering skyscrapers, architectural marvels, 
and awe-inspiring infrastructure. In just 
a few decades, it has transformed from a 
small fishing village into a leading global 
powerhouse.
This astonishing growth is reflected in 
Shenzhen's meteoric economic rise. The City's 
GDP has soared to approximately $500 billion. 
To put this into perspective, Sri Lanka's 
projected GDP for 2024 is around $80 billion, 
making Shenzhen's GDP—just that of a single 
city—over six times larger than Sri Lanka's 
entire economy.
Even more impressive is Shenzhen's ability to 
achieve this rapid development while tackling 
environmental challenges. Despite the vast 
scale of its infrastructure and industries, 
Shenzhen has emerged as one of the cleanest 
cities in both China and the world. How 
clean, you ask? Consider this: as of December 
2024, Colombo's Air Quality Index (AQI) 
fluctuates between 96 and 106, categorized 
as 'Moderate,' with some areas facing even 
higher pollution levels. Meanwhile, Shenzhen, 
with infrastructure and industrial activity far 
surpassing Colombo's, has maintained an AQI 
ranging from 24 to 64, indicating consistent 
'Good' to 'Moderate' air quality.
Environmental experts, speaking to Jaffna 
Monitor, have highlighted Shenzhen as a 
shining example of a top-tier international 
city that consistently meets national air quality 
standards.
The Birth of a Global Icon: Shenzhen's 
Extraordinary Journey
A local told Jaffna Monitor that Shenzhen's 
transformation began in 1980 when it was 
designated as China's first-ever Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ). This bold initiative was 
a cornerstone of Deng Xiaoping's sweeping 
reforms. Widely regarded as the architect of 
modern China, Deng opened the nation's 
economy to the world after decades of 
isolation under strict communist policies.</p>

Few, including locals who spoke to Jaffna 
Monitor, could have imagined the seismic 
changes ahead. "We never imagined our 
town would become a global economic 
powerhouse," one resident remarked. Yet, the 
decision to transform this unassuming village 
into a testing ground for free-market reforms 
set in motion a dramatic evolution.
Experts told Jaffna Monitor that China's 
economic condition before the reforms was 
dire, plagued by inefficiencies in its centrally 
planned system. In 1981, more than 88% of 
the population lived below the international 
poverty line. Industries were state-owned 
and technologically outdated, trade was 
minimal, and foreign investment was virtually 
nonexistent.
However, the tide began to turn with the 
reforms initiated under Deng Xiaoping. The 
announcement in May 1980 to establish 
the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) marked 
a significant departure from China's past 
policies. Experts noted that Shenzhen was 
strategically chosen due to its proximity to 
Hong Kong, a thriving capitalist economy at 
the time, and envisioned as mainland China's 
answer to Hong Kong.
The SEZ implemented groundbreaking 
measures, including tax incentives, relaxed 
labor laws, and reduced regulatory barriers, 
fostering an environment designed for 
economic experimentation. An economic 
stalwart, speaking with Jaffna Monitor, 
remarked, "As China's first Special Economic 
Zone (SEZ), Shenzhen was envisioned as a 
testing ground where market capitalism could 
thrive under the framework of 'socialism with 
Chinese characteristics.'"
The results were nothing short of 
transformative. Billions of dollars flowed into 
the City; Skyscrapers rose swiftly, like bamboo 
shoots after rain. Shenzhen rapidly gained a 
reputation as China's gateway to the world. 
By the 1990s, its economy was thriving and 
rivaling the vibrancy and dynamism of the 
most developed cities globally.
Yet, this meteoric rise came at a steep cost.
As factories churned out goods at an 
unprecedented pace, the City's environment 
bore the brunt of industrialization. By the 
end of the 20th century, Shenzhen stood at a 
critical crossroads. Its success had come at the 
expense of its air, water, and land.
Birth of Shenzhen's Green Revolution
Then came what experts call Shenzhen's Green 
Revolution—Guided by expert advice, the city 
government adopted a series of ambitious, 
science-backed, and innovative strategies 
aimed at tackling pollution while maintaining 
its remarkable economic growth.
So, how did Shenzhen pull off this 
transformation?
Revolutionizing Transportation
One of the most transformative measures 
undertaken by Shenzhen's authorities was 
revolutionizing its transportation system. 
In a pioneering effort, Shenzhen electrified 
its entire public bus fleet. Building on this 
success, the City went a step further by 
electrifying over 99% of its taxi fleet.
To encourage the adoption of electric vehicles 
(EVs), generous subsidies were offered to 
buyers. As a result, EVs have become widely 
used in both private and public transportation. 
Shenzhen's infrastructure has transformed 
to meet the demands of EVs. The city has 
developed over 80,000 charging stations to</p>

ensure convenient charging, while numerous 
companies are actively working to enhance 
charging speeds further.
The city has successfully fostered a collective 
mindset that not only embraces electric 
vehicles (EVs) but also seamlessly integrates 
them into everyday life. Remarkably, 
Shenzhen's residents have enthusiastically 
adopted EVs, showing little to no resistance to 
the transition.
The City of a Thousand Parks
The authorities didn't stop at revolutionizing 
Shenzhen's transportation system—they 
rejuvenated old parks and created new ones, 
transforming the City into a green paradise. 
Today, Shenzhen is aptly called "The City of 
a Thousand Parks," with over 1,200 parks, 
ranging from revitalized natural reserves 
like Wutong Mountain National Forest Park 
to newly developed, charming community 
spaces.
Unlike many other rapidly industrializing 
cities, Shenzhen integrated vast green areas 
into its urban design. Adding to its progressive 
urban philosophy, Shenzhen is one of the few 
cities in the world where pets are allowed on 
public transportation. It's not uncommon to 
see pet owners riding the metro, boarding 
buses, or walking through shopping malls with 
their dogs.
Dasha River Ecological Corridor
Undoubtedly, One of Shenzhen's most 
remarkable environmental achievements is 
the regeneration of the Dasha River Ecological 
Corridor, a landmark project in the City's 
Nanshan District. Once a neglected and 
polluted waterway, the corridor now spans 
approximately 13.7 kilometers (about 8.5 
miles) from the Changlingpi Reservoir to the 
estuary of Shenzhen Bay, covering an area of 
nearly 950,000 square meters.
The revitalized corridor is adorned with 
vibrant plants and blooming flowers along 
its banks. Speaking to Jaffna Monitor, an 
expert emphasized the innovation behind the 
project: "The greenery along the Dasha River 
is carefully chosen to be non-invasive to native</p>

species and is specifically designed to filter 
pollutants from rainwater and city wastewater. 
This approach not only purifies the water but 
also creates a thriving habitat for wildlife."
Industrial Transformation: From Smoke to 
Silicon
Shenzhen's rise to global prominence began 
with its manufacturing sector. However, 
as factories churned out products at an 
unprecedented pace, they also released 
pollutants into the air, water, and soil. 
Recognizing the unsustainability of this 
path, experts say Shenzhen embarked on 
an ambitious transformation to rewrite its 
industrial narrative—what they describe as 
evolving from a "city of smoke" to a "city of 
silicon."
The Shift to High-Tech Industries
Understanding that pollution and long-term 
prosperity could not coexist, the government 
laid the groundwork for a revolutionary shift 
toward cleaner, smarter industries. Polluting 
factories were systematically relocated or shut 
down, making way for innovation-driven 
enterprises.
The City became a magnet for high-tech 
industries, attracting pioneers in electronics, 
biotechnology, and renewable energy. Iconic 
companies like Huawei, Tencent, and BYD 
found fertile ground in Shenzhen.
Restoring Rivers and Revitalizing 
Ecosystems

gravest challenges, threatening the City's 
environment and public health as it expanded 
rapidly. However, Since 2016, the City has 
implemented a series of ambitious measures 
to combat water pollution, including the 
construction of nearly 4,000 miles of advanced 
sewage networks using cutting-edge rainwater 
diversion technology.
This innovative approach separates rainwater 
from sewage, preventing untreated wastewater 
from overflowing into rivers and other water 
bodies during heavy rains. By channeling 
rainwater and sewage through distinct 
systems, Shenzhen has significantly reduced 
contamination in its waterways. This massive 
infrastructure investment has transformed 
previously polluted rivers and lakes into clean, 
flowing waters that now sustain thriving 
ecosystems.
Restoring Wild Waterways
In 2019, Shenzhen achieved a historic 
milestone by becoming the first City in China 
to fully restore its wild waterways. Once 
clogged with waste and severely polluted, 
rivers such as the Maozhou River have been 
revitalized. The Maozhou River, previously 
considered one of the most polluted rivers in 
Guangdong Province, now boasts clear waters 
and flourishing biodiversity.
Shenzhen's water restoration efforts go hand 
in hand with its broader commitment to 
sustainability. The City has invested in smart 
water management systems, including real-
time monitoring technologies, to promptly 
detect and address pollution sources. 
Furthermore, Shenzhen has created multiple 
wetland parks and constructed wetlands, 
which act as natural filters to purify water and 
provide habitats for wildlife.
The results of these efforts have been 
transformative. Over 98% of Shenzhen's 
waterways have now met the required water 
quality standards, a feat celebrated as a model 
for other cities in China and around the world.
A New Era of Green Architecture
Shenzhen's green building revolution is 
underpinned by rigorous regulations that 
mandate energy-efficient designs, the use 
of sustainable materials, and the integration 
of renewable energy. Buildings in Shenzhen 
employ advanced materials designed to 
minimize heat absorption while enhancing 
insulation, significantly reducing the need for 
energy-intensive cooling systems in the City's 
subtropical climate. Strategic architectural 
elements like optimized window placements, 
light wells, and reflective glass maximize 
natural light and reduce dependency on 
artificial lighting, cutting electricity use by up 
to 30% in many cases.
Proper ventilation systems ensure high 
indoor air quality while conserving energy. 
These systems often feature smart sensors 
that intelligently regulate air circulation and 
temperature.
Pioneering the Vertical Green City 
Revolution
Shenzhen exemplifies a modern city where 
towering skyscrapers are not merely feats of 
engineering but living, breathing ecosystems. 
A green vertical town incorporates greenery 
such as plants, trees, and gardens directly 
into the design of tall buildings, creating eco-
friendly urban spaces that reduce pollution, 
enhance air quality, and improve the well-
being of residents. This concept is no longer a 
futuristic vision in Shenzhen—it is a thriving 
reality. Shenzhen has emerged as a global</p>

beacon of eco-friendly and green vertical 
urban development by seamlessly integrating 
sustainable architecture with vertical greenery.
Sponge City Program: Transforming Flood 
Challenges into Opportunities
Shenzhen's innovative Sponge City Program 
is redefining urban resilience by transforming 
the challenge of urban flooding—a common 
scenario in many cities—into an opportunity 
for sustainable development. The program is 
designed to absorb, store, and purify rainwater 
using a combination of green infrastructure 
and smart water management systems. 
Permeable pavements, rain gardens, bioswales, 
and wetlands are strategically integrated into 
the cityscape to naturally filter and reuse 
rainwater, significantly reducing surface runoff 
during heavy rains, experts explained to Jaffna 
Monitor.
The impact of the Sponge City Program 
has been transformative. Flood risks have 
decreased, water quality has improved, and the 
urban heat island effect has been mitigated. 
By capturing up to 70% of stormwater, 
Shenzhen ensures cleaner water for irrigation, 
landscaping, and various non-potable urban 
uses. Moreover, experts note that by enhancing 
groundwater recharge, the program is 
contributing to long-term water security.
Solar Power at the Forefront
Solar energy is another cornerstone of 
Shenzhen's architectural innovation. Many of 
the City's high-rise buildings are outfitted with 
photovoltaic panels, harnessing the region's 
abundant sunlight to generate clean, renewable 
energy. Some buildings even feature integrated 
solar façades, turning entire surfaces into 
energy-generating systems. This widespread 
use of solar technology has significantly 
reduced Shenzhen's reliance on fossil fuels, 
contributing to a notable decrease in carbon 
emissions.
Urban Reforestation and Coastal 
Restoration
Over the years, the City has planted millions 
of trees, converting wastelands into lush 
parks and nature reserves. These efforts have 
helped absorb carbon emissions, reduce urban 
flooding, and improve air quality.
One of the City's standout projects is the 
restoration of its mangrove forests along the 
coastline. These ecosystems act as natural 
flood barriers, protect biodiversity, and 
sequester carbon.</p>

Tackling Waste Management
Shenzhen's population explosion created 
mountains of waste. To address this, the City 
invested in advanced waste-to-energy (WTE) 
plants capable of generating clean energy 
from municipal solid waste. These facilities 
have drastically reduced the amount of waste 
sent to landfills while supplying electricity to 
thousands of homes.
The City also implemented a comprehensive 
recycling program, with strict laws requiring 
businesses and residents to sort their waste. 
Public education campaigns have played a 
vital role in changing attitudes toward waste 
management.
Metro System
A study on Shenzhen's metro system reveals 
that expanded and well-connected metro 
networks significantly reduce pollution by 
diverting on-road traffic to rail, cutting vehicle 
emissions. Stations integrated with transit-
oriented development further amplified these 
effects, showcasing how comprehensive rail 
systems can effectively mitigate urban air 
pollution.
Technology as a Catalyst
Shenzhen's success owes much to its embrace 
of technology. Smart city initiatives use 
big data, AI, and IoT (Internet of Things) 
to monitor air quality, manage traffic, 
and optimize energy use. For example, 
real-time air quality sensors provide data 
to policymakers and residents, enabling 
immediate action during pollution spikes. 
In addition, Shenzhen's tech sector has 
driven innovation in renewable energy and 
sustainable urban solutions.
High-Tech Fight for Clean Air
Shenzhen has leveraged advanced technology 
to enhance its air quality management 
systems. The City operates a comprehensive 
network of monitoring stations that collect</p>

real-time data on pollutants such as PM2.5, 
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. This 
data is integrated into a centralized platform 
that utilizes AI algorithms to analyze trends, 
predict pollution spikes, and identify hotspots. 
Additionally, Shenzhen employs drones 
equipped with sensors to inspect areas that are 
difficult to access, such as industrial zones and 
construction sites, further strengthening its 
enforcement capabilities.
In 2018, Shenzhen launched a real-time air 
monitoring system as part of its campaign to 
improve air quality. Automatic monitoring 
takes data from 74 PM2.5 monitoring sites, all 
connected to a unified platform.
Data-Assisted Enforcement: A Simple Yet 
Powerful Tool
Shenzhen has also harnessed the power of 
data to revolutionize air quality management. 
Using advanced monitoring technologies, 
the City collects two critical types of data 
hourly: emission levels from factories and a 
comprehensive air quality index. This data is 
not only meticulously gathered but also made 
publicly available, empowering citizens and 
environmental advocates to monitor trends 
and hold authorities accountable.
"If a company is caught discharging pollutants 
these days, it becomes the subject of hourly 
inspections," an expert explained. This 
heightened level of scrutiny serves as a strong 
deterrent to potential violators while enabling 
authorities to respond swiftly to any incidents, 
he added.
Accountability at Every Level
Unlike in the past, when city and township 
officials were responsible for collecting 
environmental data—often leaving room for 
manipulation—data collection in Shenzhen is 
now centralized, automated, and technology-
driven, ensuring accuracy and transparency. 
Experts note that this shift has effectively 
closed the loopholes that once allowed local 
authorities to "massage the results."
In addition, city officials are now held to 
strict performance standards set by higher 
authorities. Failure to meet air quality targets 
can result in demotions, fines, or other 
disciplinary actions. Experts explain that</p>

this top-down accountability has created a 
powerful incentive for cities like Shenzhen to 
rigorously enforce environmental regulations.
Rigorous Enforcement: The Cornerstone of 
Shenzhen's Clean Air Success
Experts told Jaffna Monitor that while many 
industrial cities worldwide have struggled 
to achieve a clean environment, Shenzhen's 
remarkable improvement in air quality can 
be attributed to its stringent enforcement of 
environmental regulations. The City deploys 
dedicated inspection teams to conduct 
unannounced factory visits, ensuring strict 
compliance with pollution control measures. 
Non-compliant factories face severe penalties, 
including substantial fines, temporary 
suspension of operations, and, in extreme 
cases, permanent closure.
Shenzhen authorities told Jaffna Monitor, 
"We punish everyone who violates our 
environmental regulations, no matter their 
size or influence. There is no gray area when it 
comes to punishing environmental violators. 
Our approach is clear and uncompromising."
Public Engagement: Naming, Shaming, 
and Empowering
In addition to regulatory enforcement, 
Shenzhen has embraced public engagement 
as a powerful tool for environmental 
reform. A local resident told Jaffna Monitor, 
"Polluting companies are publicly named and 
shamed, with their violations highlighted in 
media reports and online platforms." This 
transparency, he explained, not only pressures 
businesses to clean up their operations but 
also empowers residents to hold companies 
accountable.
Citizens play an active role in this community-
driven approach to pollution control. They can 
report violations through dedicated hotlines 
and mobile apps, creating a network of vigilant 
individuals committed to safeguarding the 
environment. This initiative has fostered a 
sense of responsibility among patriotic citizens 
who take pride in ensuring their City remains 
clean, orderly, and sustainable.
Navigating Future Hurdles
Environmental experts have also cautioned 
that while Shenzhen's initiatives have set 
benchmarks globally, sustaining these 
achievements in the long term will require 
constant vigilance and adaptation to emerging 
challenges. For instance, maintaining water 
quality and combating air pollution could 
become more complex as industrial and 
population density increases. The City's 
reliance on advanced technologies to monitor 
and address environmental issues, while 
effective, could face risks related to system 
scalability and data security.
A Model for the World
Shenzhen is a classic example of how massive 
economic growth and the construction of 
towering skyscrapers can coexist harmoniously 
with environmental sustainability, given strong 
commitment and visionary leadership. By 
minimizing corruption, integrating advanced 
technologies, enforcing effective governance, 
and fostering active public engagement, any 
city can transform environmental challenges 
into opportunities. This offers an inspiring 
model for a country like Sri Lanka, whose 
people have recently set aside their divisions 
and appear to have embraced a shared vision 
of development.</p>
