The debate surrounding the 
proposition of a 'common Tamil 
candidate in the upcoming 
presidential election' is gathering 
intense discussion across various 
platforms. Let's delve into the 
historical context to understand 
the implications by examining past 
presidential elections involving 
Tamil candidates.
In 1978, Sri Lanka marked a 
pivotal moment with a sweeping 
constitutional change that ushered in 
an executive presidential system. The 
first election under this new regime 
took place in 1982. Mr. Kumar 
Ponnambalam of the All Ceylon 
Tamil Congress threw his hat in the 
ring with the bold proclamation, 
"Tamil Nation is a separate nation." 
Despite the powerful slogan, the 
election results told a harsh tale. 
Kumar garnered 173,934 votes, a 
mere 2.67% of the national vote, 
relegating him to fourth place. 
The victor of the election was J.R. 
Jayewardene of the United National 
Party, with Hector Kobbekaduwa 
of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and 
Rohana Wijeweera of the Janatha 
Vimukthi Peramuna securing the 
second and third spots, respectively. 
Yet, the narrative shifted in Jaffna, 
where Kumar captured a significant 
40% of the vote, showcasing a stark 
contrast in regional support.
When Kumar declared his run for 
the presidency, journalists sought

insights from Mr. Amirthalingam, secretary 
of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). 
He sharply criticized the move, stating, "My 
alliance does not resort to such cheap tactics," 
and urged the Tamil populace to boycott the 
presidential election. Furthermore, TULF, 
alongside leftist Tamil parties, accused Mr. 
Kumar of entering the fray merely to siphon 
Tamil votes away from J.R. Jayewardene, 
inadvertently aiding in his electoral triumph.
The notion of a common Tamil candidate for 
president made a comedic comeback in the 
2019 presidential election. After breaking ties 
with TULF and TELO, the ever-controversial 
Mr. Sivajilingam decided to go solo, throwing 
his hat into the presidential ring as an 
independent. He managed to scrape together 
just 0.09 percent of the votes (a whopping 
12,256), turning his serious political bid 
into more of an election jest. Ironically, the 
Rajapaksas ultimately reaped the benefits from 
Mr. Sivajilingam's bid, as his presence in the 
race played into their strategic interests.
Reflecting on the outcomes of these two 
elections, particularly after the 1977 racial riots 
when Tamil aspirations for liberation were at 
their zenith, the voters in Jaffna District chose 
to defy the TULF's boycott call and cast their 
ballots for Kumar Ponnambalam. Despite 
this local support, Kumar struggled to garner 
substantial backing from Tamils residing 
beyond the Northern and Eastern provinces.
In the 2019 eighth presidential election, Mr. 
's bid as a Tamil candidate was resoundingly 
dismissed by Tamil voters from all regions. 
At the same time, the Tamil community's 
opposition to the Rajapaksas translated into 
robust support for Mr. Sajith Premadasa in the 
North, East, and Central Highlands, where he 
claimed notable victories.
Amidst the election fervor, suspicions surfaced 
about Mr. Sivajilingam possibly colluding 
with the Rajapaksas. These doubts were fueled 
by observations from political analysts who 
pointed out that Sinhala-language media 
outlets, known for their pro-Rajapaksa 
stance, frequently featured Mr. Sivajilingam's 
fiery interviews on Tamil nationalism. Such 
coverage was seen as a tactic to stoke Sinhala 
nationalism, which, in turn, is believed to have 
bolstered the Rajapaksas' electoral stronghold.
In the 2019 eighth presidential election, Tamil 
voters came to a sobering realization: "A Tamil 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa</p>

cannot achieve anything in the presidential 
election." The decision to field a common 
Tamil candidate risked splitting the Tamil vote. 
As a result, the next president would likely 
ascend to power predominantly with Sinhalese 
support, further widening the divide between 
the Colombo leadership and the Tamil 
populace. This dynamic risked diminishing the 
national sentiments of the Tamils.
Therefore, the Tamil people and those 
genuinely fighting for Tamil rights must avoid 
falling into these deceptive tactics of fielding 
a common candidate. They should completely 
reject any moves to field a Tamil common 
candidate in the upcoming presidential 
elections, recognizing these strategies as 
potentially undermining their struggle for 
genuine autonomy and rights.
According to the current political situation 
in Southern Sri Lanka, the major parties and 
primary candidates appear evenly matched, 
creating a scenario where neither a Southern 
party nor leader can win a majority of votes 
on their own. The majority of people openly 
admit that the decision of who will become 
the president rests in the hands of minorities. 
In such a decisive moment, Tamils can decide 
who they want as the winning president and 
take part in the victory.
In the previous presidential election, the 
Rajapaksas reportedly utilized Mr. Sivajilingam 
to secure a victory. It is anticipated that this 
time, too, a Southern presidential candidate 
supported by the Rajapaksas might indirectly 
promote a Tamil candidate to gather Sinhala 
nationalist votes in the South. Similarly, 
regional dominance and efforts to prevent 
Tamils in Sri Lanka from emerging as a 
decisive force are expected to be vigorously 
pursued.
This tactic underscores the strategic 
manipulation in the political landscape, 
where the Rajapaksas might use the facade of 
diversity and minority inclusion to consolidate 
the Sinhala nationalist base, thereby weakening 
the Tamil position and fragmenting their 
votes. This scenario necessitates a critical and 
strategic response from the Tamil community 
to counteract these maneuvers and to leverage 
their collective voting power to influence 
significant political outcomes.
Moreover, politicians who resist forming a 
common Tamil alliance during parliamentary 
elections yet advocate loudly for a common 
candidate in presidential races often expose 
their true motives and the interests they 
represent when their facades drop in such 
critical moments. This scenario highlights 
the urgent need for strategic unity and clear 
direction among Tamil parties, enabling them 
to effectively wield their political influence to 
secure significant advances in governance and 
rights.
Sri Lankan Tamils should fortify their stance 
through a strategic plan that entails backing 
a Tamil-friendly and viable presidential 
candidate. This strategy demands active 
engagement in central political processes 
to steer policy and governance reforms. 
By synchronizing these initiatives, Tamils 
can better ensure that their political and 
administrative demands are met more 
cohesively and effectively.
If some Tamil leaders imprudently push for a 
common Tamil candidate in the presidential 
election, it would not only be seen as a farcical 
move but also aid Sinhala chauvinistic parties 
in using this as a tool to solidify the Sinhala 
majority votes. It is crucial that Tamils avoid 
this mistake.</p>
