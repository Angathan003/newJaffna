In 1981, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, the first 
uniform of the Liberation Tigers was designed 
by Nataraj Master. Nataraj Master also created 
the emblem of the Liberation Tigers. During 
this period, the Tigers lacked the resources 
to design and sew a unique uniform. LTTE 
supremo Prabhakaran devised an idea. He 
directed Nataraj Master to modify a Tamil 
Nadu police khaki uniform purchased from 
a shop in Madurai by painting stripes with 
a small brush using oil paint. Prabhakaran 
aimed for the uniform to mimic the stripes 
of a tiger's skin; thus, the first uniform of the 
Tigers was created.
Wearing this uniform, Prabhakaran took 
a photograph while holding an SMG gun, 
which had been snatched from Police 
Officer Bastiampillai after killing him at 
Maduppannai on April 7, 1978. This was the 
first photo of Prabhakaran taken in uniform. 
Lieutenant Seelan, also known as Charles 
Anthony, was also photographed wearing the 
same uniform. These photos were taken by 
Nataraj Master at his home.

After the ethnic riots in July 1983, the Indian 
government began assisting Tamil militant 
organizations. Consequently, the Tigers 
started using Tamil Nadu as a base for their 
operations. During this time, they donned 
uniforms similar to those of the Indian Army, 
which were purchased in Chennai. These 
uniforms were also worn during the conflict 
with the Indian Army in 1987. This led to 
some unique incidents, as both the Tigers and 
the Indian Army, clad in identical uniforms, 
clashed. In close combat, it became difficult 
to distinguish friend from foe, creating 
confusion. To mitigate this, Prabhakaran 
implemented a change. He instructed that 
black cloth be added to the calf and forearm 
sections of the uniforms worn by the Tigers, 
aiding in identifying their fighters during 
battles.

Due to the urban setting of their operations, Kiddu did not prioritize uniforms, resulting in the fighters 
wearing shorts provided by the LTTE.</p>

In 1989, negotiations started between the 
Tigers and the Premadasa government. After 
this, there was a decrease in Indian Army 
operations, and an unofficial ceasefire was 
observed from October 1989. During this 
period, Prabhakaran fully realized his uniform 
project. In the Erode region of Tamil Nadu, a 
stronghold of Tiger supporters, fabric for the 
uniforms was procured. These fabrics were 
then transported by boat to Sri Lanka and 
delivered to a camp in the Niththikaikulam 
forest, where uniforms for the Tigers were 
produced. Numerous tailors from Jaffna and 
Chavakachcheri were coerced into making 
these uniforms in the forest. A Tiger member 
named Ajith, who now resides in England, was 
responsible for this stitching unit.
Following the withdrawal of the Indian Army 
from the northern and eastern parts of Sri 
Lanka in 1990, the Tigers' commander in 
the Batticaloa and Ampara districts, Karuna 
Amman, commissioned local weavers in 
Batticaloa to produce the uniforms. Later, 
uniforms made abroad by the Tigers' 
international representative, Kumaran 
Pathmanathan, also known as KP, were 
utilized by the Tigers few a times only.
In 1996, after relocating to the Vanni region, 
the Tigers adopted distinct uniforms for each 
of their divisions - land, naval, air, and black 
tiger forces - each distinguishable only by 
color. Separate uniforms were also used by the 
Tigers' police and border forces. In 1983, the 
LTTE's first book, titled 'State Terrorism and 
Armed Revolution,' featured Prabhakaran's 
first photo in uniform. In this photo, he is 
seen wearing the Tigers' initial uniform. 
Prabhakaran's final photograph, taken when he 
lay dead in Nandikadal on May 18, 2009, also 
shows him wearing the Tigers' uniform.

hen sunlight pinched him, he jumped up in 
alarm. A tall temple tower was visible at 
a distance. He congratulated himself for sailing 
all the way to India all alone with a vēṭṭi for a 
sail. He noticed that the boat was moving neither 
forward nor backwards but was circling in place. 
He raised his hand and realized that the sea was 
completely still with no sign of a wind. When he 
tried to push the boat forward with a quant pole, 
the pole touched the ground. He was excited. But 
the boat refused to budge. When he finally made 
up his mind to jump into the water and swim 
ashore, he noticed two boats zipping towards 
him at high speed. As the boats approached, 
Poṉrāsā began to whistle enthusiastically,

thinking ‘Indian navy.’ He was relieved, 
imagining that the navy itself would give him 
a ride towards Rāmēswaram.
When the navy boats surrounded Poṉrāsā’s, 
he adjusted his vēṭṭi, buttoned his shirt all the 
way up to the neck, unrolled his sleeves to 
their full length, and wore a cultivated look 
and the expression of a refugee. He brought 
his hands together above his head in greeting 
and said “vaṇakkam sir.” The four sailors who 
jumped into his boat started beating him up 
without uttering a word. “Sir, I am Tamil,” 
Poṉrāsā pleaded. The beatings did not stop. 
His lip cracked open, and a crimson streak of 
blood ran down his white shirt. Only when 
they hauled Poṉrāsā into their boat, towed 
his, and sped towards the shore did he realize 
that the temple tower at the distance did not 
belong to the Rameswaram temple, but to the 
Naiṉātīvu Nāgabhūshaṇi Ambāḷ temple. He 
was disgusted to realize that, after embarking 
from Vēlaṉai and sailing through the night, 
he had only reached the island just next to 
Vēlaṉai, Naiṉātīvu.
Naiṉātīvu was a fortified base of the Sri 
Lankan navy. A vessel could leave or arrive 
at Naiṉātīvu only with the express permission 
of the navy. At that time some four thousand 
people lived in Naiṉātīvu. Not even a speck 
of dust could stir in that island without 
the navy’s knowledge. Poṉrāsā’s boat had 
shattered and breached such an iron fortress.
Poṉrāsā was stark naked, tied to a flagpole in 
front of a sub-commander’s office. He was 
halfway up the pole. Surely the sailors would 
have felt a tinge of envy when they regarded 
Poṉrāsā’s burly arms and legs, his broad 
shoulders, and strong chest. Droplets of blood 
kept blossoming like tiny little ruby gems 
throughout his coal black body. The two blue-
gem ear studs from his underwear were now 
inside the drawer of the sub-commander’s 
desk. The navy was busy trying to piece 
together what kind of Tiger they had netted. 
What confused them was that this Tiger was 
over fifty years old. Even Pirapākaraṉ, the 
supreme leader of Tigers, was just 36 then.
As the sun scorched, Poṉrāsā was crying 
out loud. He pleaded in all three languages: 
Tamil, Sinhala, and English. His heart said, “I 
will survive this calamity.” But if he relaxed, 
he was afraid that the navy might shoot him 
and throw his body into the sea. So, he kept 
up his theater of screaming and begging for 
water without any let up. When he shuddered, 
pleading for water, he was fed seawater. 
Poṉrāsā had indeed made a mistake. As soon 
as he was caught, he could have admitted to 
the truth – that he was on a clueless drunken 
pursuit of his sons who had fled to India. But 
he thought that admitting he was sailing to 
India might lead to bigger difficulties. So, he 
had claimed that he was out fishing but was 
blown off course. But the sailors only needed 
a couple of questions to conclude that he 
knew nothing about the sea, and that he was 
on a stolen boat.
For two days, he languished on the flagpole 
without food or water. On the third day, 
he was locked up in a room. There was 
plenty of creepy crawly traffic in the room. 
When the sun set, it was hell for Poṉrāsā. 
Drunken sailors would drag him out of the 
room and, in the name of an inquiry, would 
ask outrageously silly questions. Poṉrāsā 
would respond with even more outrageous 
answers. He would draw a map to explain to 
them where Tiger camps lay, where the Tiger 
leader probably was, and where Soosai, the 
leader of Sea Tigers, might have been at that 
moment. The next day, the sailors would ask 
him to draw the same map. He would draw 
a map that was in complete contrast to the 
previous day’s map. Pirapākaraṉ’s camp that 
was in Point Pedro the previous day would 
have now magically transported itself to</p>

Chāvakachchēri. The sailors beat Poṉrāsā 
with coconut tree petioles, rope, and thick 
poles. Within a week, Poṉrāsā’s skin had 
peeled off from half of his body.
After a week, the beatings subsided. The 
sailors now understood very clearly that 
they had caught a petty thief and not a 
Tiger. Poṉrāsā had also become adept at 
giving the navy what it wanted. He was an 
excellent cook. He cooked tasty meals for 
the commanders and gained their sympathy. 
Eventually he had morphed into a sort of pet 
for the navy. They let him go out into the 
village. He roamed around the village all day 
and returned to the navy camp to sleep in 
his room. He had cleaned out his room and 
fashioned a bed for him out of wooden planks.
The villagers called him ‘navy aiyā.’ They 
were afraid of him because of his navy 
connection. Palmyra toddy and fish were 
plentiful in Naiṉātīvu, Since there was no 
prospect of escaping the island without the 
navy’s consent, Poṉrāsā thought no more 
about escape. He stopped blaming his sons 
who had fled to India. Perhaps he realized 
what would have been in store for them had 
the youngsters been caught by the same 
people who had caught him, an old man, 
and had treated him like a goat waiting to be 
skinned. Occasionally he went to the navy 
camp. But otherwise, he stayed in the temple 
hall. After all, this was the island that gave 
Maṇimēkalai, the heroine of the eponymous 
Tamil epic, the magical bottomless vessel</p>

amudhasurabi, from which one could keep 
drawing rice without end. Poṉrāsā would 
never run out of rice either! With the temple 
rice, the almsgiving hall of the temple, and the 
butter and jam from the navy camp, he put on 
some weight.
In the mornings, after a thorough and intense 
checking by the navy, a motorboat left 
Naiṉātīvu to Puṅgudutīvu Kuṟikaṭṭuvāṉ port. 
The navy permitted people to board that boat 
only if they had some absolutely essential 
business that required travel. Poṉrāsā sent a 
letter to his wife through one such passenger.
For three months Gñaṉammā was mourning 
her husband, not knowing whether he was 
alive or dead. When the letter arrived in her 
hands, she was totally confused. The letter 
had said that ‘the civil administration in 
Naiṉātīvu is excellent. As soon as you receive 
this letter, come to Naiṉātīvu. The navy is 
very supportive of me.’ When Gñaṉammā 
showed the letter to to a neighbor, he had 
advised her to take it to Tigers because he 
suspected that the letter contained a trap. This 
is how the letter ended up in the Tiger office.</p>

The New Year celebration in the navy camp 
was raucous. That day Poṉrāsā had made a 
special seafood feast with cuttlefish, prawns, 
and crabs, making the commanders very 
happy. The commanders gifted him a full 
bottle of Mendis arrack. He sat on the beach, 
enjoying it little by little. The cold December 
wind made him shiver. From the south, he 
saw a skyrocket from Puṅgudutīvu shoot 
up and burst into a colorful bouquet. When 
half of the arrack bottle was empty, he felt a 
certain virility in his body, He grabbed the 
bottle and started walking towards the camp. 
Sinhala bailā songs blared forth from the 
camp. He thought to himself that if the Tigers 
attacked at that moment, the camp would fall 
very easily. His feet dragged him towards 
the village. All the houses were submerged 
in darkness. On festive days like these, it 
was common for drunken sailors to enter the 
houses in the village to harass women. He 
knew that therefore the village folk were extra 
careful on such days. His mind wandered into 
erotic thoughts. He emptied the bottle into 
his mouth. The bottle was still a quarter full. 
He returned to the beach, put the bottle on the 
ground, stripped down and walked into the 
water until it was waist high. Then he closed 
his eyes and started to masturbate. After a 
few minutes, with weariness and disgust, he 
walked back to the shore and dressed himself. 
When he lifted the arrack bottle and opened it, 
he felt a heavy blow on his neck. He swirled 
around like an angry wounded animal. Before 
his brain had had time to judge the situation 
and act accordingly, he heard the bottle in his 
hand crash into the head of his assailant and 
break into pieces.
The next morning some sailors tied a stone 
to his neck and took him out to sea on a boat. 
The bandaged sailor who was attacked by him 
the previous night could not take his eyes off 
of Poṉrāsā. He remained quiet. They then tied 
him to a long rope and lowered him and the 
stone into the sea. He fell into the womb of 
Mother Sea. He flapped his arms and legs like 
a baby. He felt gravel stones pressing into his 
belly. He could feel that his head was about to 
explode. A fog of darkness began to pervade 
his brain. Then the sailors pulled him up with 
the rope. He was three quarters dead when he 
surfaced. After this game was repeated a few 
times, they hauled him back into the boat. 
The passenger boat from Naiṉātīvu port to 
Kuṟikaṭṭuvāṉ was coming towards them at 
a distance. The navy maneuvered their boat 
abreast the passenger boat to transfer Poṉrāsā 
to the passenger boat. The sub commander 
thrust a small package into his hands. It 
had the two ear studs with blue gems. The 
commander said to Poṉrāsā in Sinhala: “Now 
Poṉrāsā knows what death is.”
Poṉrāsā put the ear studs into his pocket. 
As soon as they reached Kuṟikaṭṭuvāṉ, he 
hurried over to the waiting minibus. Within a 
couple of minutes, a voice was heard to call 
out “aiyā, please climb down from the bus.” 
Tigers were waiting outside the bus. When he 
got off, he was blindfolded using a piece of 
black cloth.
There were about two hundred prisoners in 
the Tiger prison. None of them knew where 
exactly the prison was. No one interrogated 
Poṉrāsā. The blue-gem ear studs were taken 
from him as soon as he was arrested. He was 
given a prison uniform. The uniform was just 
half a sarong. There were no other clothes. 
Undergarments were prohibited. His feet 
were bound to a chain with three iron balls. 
Tigers already had all the information about 
Poṉrāsā. The owner of the boat he stole had 
filed a complaint with Tigers. They also had 
the letter he sent to his wife from Naiṉātīvu. 
Because he had left on a boat all alone, Tigers 
in the prison camp called him ‘captain.’ All 
they asked for was just one thing: “Captain, 
tell us the truth.”</p>

Poṉrāsā told them everything: truths and 
fabrications. They listened patiently and 
recorded his statement on a large register. 
Then they asked again, “Captain, tell us the 
truth.” Poṉrāsā was never angry when the 
navy beat him. But when Tigers beat him, he 
couldn’t control his anger. When they beat 
him, he closed his eyes tightly shut. His blood 
boiled, thinking ‘look at these weaklings, 
they look like number three sewing machine 
spindles, but dare lay their hands on a well-
built body like mine.’ When he drew a map 
of the Naiṉātīvu navy base, Tigers were truly 
astounded.
Staring at the map that Poṉrāsā had drawn, 
the man-in-charge barked an order to the 
man standing next to him, “bring that civil 
engineer here.” A while later a young man 
whose hands and legs were in chains was 
dragged there on his knees, like a dog. The 
man-in-charge showed Poṉrāsā’s map to him 
and said, “You call yourself a civil engineer? 
Look at this map Captain had drawn. Even 
after six months, you couldn’t draw a map 
of the Park Camp properly.” He then turned 
to Poṉrāsā and gave him a spade handle. 
“Captain, beat him with this. Let us see if 
that makes him recall what he had studied.” 
Poṉrāsā took the spade handle without any 
hesitation. The first blow landed on the young 
man’s back. Poṉrāsā growled in a loud voice 
as he beat the young man, “dēy, traitor. It is 
because of people like you that we haven’t 
yet gotten Tamil Eelam. These children are 
giving everything, including their lives, to 
the battle. But you betray them. Have you 
ever bothered to think about the hardships of 
the Tamil people?” The young man’s body 
just trembled, but he didn’t even moan in 
response. When Poṉrāsā tried to leap over 
to beat the young man again, he tripped over 
his own foot chain and fell face first over 
the young man’s body. He knew absolutely 
nothing about the young man.
In the Tiger prison, food was served only 
twice a day. They added a little sugar into 
white rice porridge. It was barely enough to 
fill a quarter of one’s stomach. When they 
apprehended him, Poṉrāsā had thought that 
they would beat him a couple of times while 
interrogating him and would then let him go.<br />
He had never expected to endure months of 
imprisonment, starvation, and torture. One 
day, when he was again asked, “Captain, 
tell us the truth,” his patience ran out and he 
told them the truth with a little harshness: 
“thambimār, I am like a father to you, it is 
wrong for you to tie me up half-naked like an 
animal. I gave you the map of the Naiṉātīvu 
camp. Instead of attacking that camp, it is 
completely unfair that you continue to torture 
this old man. I have received enough beatings 
from the navy. Tamils should not do this to 
other Tamils.” The man-in-charge listened 
silently. Then, after deep thought, he ordered 
Poṉrāsā to be confined in a ‘karappu’.
You have doubtless seen a karappu before – 
the portable chicken coop made from canes.</p>

This karappu was a triangular-shaped barbed 
wire cage as tall as a grown man. They 
put Poṉrāsā in such a cage for three days. 
Apparently, the man-in-charge had grumbled, 
“Captain is talking politics.” One could not 
turn this way or the other inside that cage. If 
one did, the barbed wire would tear their skin.
For three days, Poṉrāsā sat inside that cage 
without food or sleep. If he dozed off, the 
barbs tore into his skin and drew blood. He 
suffered as though he was wearing a shirt 
made of thorns. In three days, his entire body 
had deep gashes with skin and flesh hanging. 
Only his head was spared. Even amidst that 
unbearable torture, Poṉrāsā could not help 
thinking that a crown of thorns would have 
remedied that shortcoming.
When the 1958 anti-Tamil riots happened, 
Poṉrāsā was exactly twenty years old. He was 
then working as a cook in a textile store called 
‘Mariāmpiḷḷai &amp; sons’ in a small town called 
Nittambuwa in Sinhala country. 
He went there when he was 
thirteen as kitchen help but had 
advanced to the position of cook. 
The owner of the store was from 
Karambaṉ. He loved Poṉrāsā’s 
cooking. Because Poṉrāsā 
had the reputation of being a 
troublemaker, he was never paid 
any salary directly. Whenever the 
owner went home to his village, 
he called Poṉrāsā’s father home 
and handed over the entire salary 
arrears to him.
During those riots, ‘Mariāmpiḷḷai 
&amp; sons’ was looted and burned. 
The owner, Mariāmpiḷḷai, was 
thrown alive into the bonfire. 
When the thugs came to grab 
Poṉrāsā, he lifted them as if 
they were rag dolls and flung 
them away. He then ran away to hide in the 
rambutān fields. The next morning when he 
saw military vehicles drive by, he ran to them. 
The army took him to a refugee camp.
When the violence subsided, he went back to 
his village with just the clothes on his back 
and the towel he was given in the refugee 
camp. A new bunch of youngsters from his 
village were getting ready to go to the south 
to find employment. It was when Poṉrāsā, 
too, was getting ready to go back to Colombo 
to search for a new job, that his village priest 
arranged for him to get a job as the cook 
for Father Varapragāsam at the Jaffna Big 
Church.
People called the Jaffna Big Church the pew 
church. That was the only church then that 
had any pews for the congregation to sit on. 
Hence the name. Father Varapragāsam loved 
Poṉrāsā’s cooking. Poṉrāsā was given a place 
to stay in the Father’s quarters. The priest</p>

was born in Malaysia and had studied in Italy. 
His knowledge of Tamil was scant. At the 
Big Church, he was responsible for the Latin 
mass. He always spoke to Poṉrāsā in English. 
Poṉrāsā responded with his talent for cooking. 
Two years after he started working there, 
Poṉrāsā fell in love with Gñaṉammā who was 
a member of the Big Church’s Legion of Mary 
singing troupe. When a great opposition arose 
in Gñaṉammā’s family, Poṉrāsā absconded 
overnight with her to Suruvil by boat. 
On the third day after they had eloped, Father 
Varapragāsam and Gñaṉammā’s father 
came to Suruvil in search of them. Father 
Varapragāsam stood in front of  Poṉrāsā’s 
house and yelled “Cook… Cook.” During 
the next morning service at the Big Church, 
crowns of thorns were placed on their heads. 
After that punishment, Father Varapragāsam 
himself performed their wedding. As a 
wedding gift to Gñaṉammā, the Father gave 
her ear studs with blue gems.
The three-day barbed wire cage punishment 
had completely worn Poṉrāsā down. His 
body kept shivering ceaselessly. It started 
to deteriorate rapidly. Like a dead palmyra 
palm tree, he was rotting on the inside. He 
was lying down all the time. Every time he 
was called for interrogation, he dragged his 
chain unsteadily as he walked. Nowadays, 
whenever he was beaten up, he cried out 
aloud. He desperately wanted to see his wife 
at least once. But he did not tell that to Tigers. 
He could bear the barbed wire cage. If they 
threw him into the bunker prison, he thought 
he would go completely crazy within twenty-
four hours.
One evening, the leg chains of Poṉrāsā and 
six other prisoners were removed. They were 
all over fifty years old. Each was given a new 
sarong and shirt. Poṉrāsā thought they were 
about to be freed. They were blindfolded in 
black cloth. Overnight, the seven prisoners 
were moved to a prison camp in Jaffna city.
After the rescue force evacuated the army 
forces trapped within Jaffna fort, the fort 
fell into the hands of Tigers who decided to 
demolish the four-hundred-year-old strong 
fort. A work gang from the prison camp where 
Poṉrāsā was being held, was taken to the fort 
already at six in the morning. They were given 
work incessantly until six in the evening. As 
the prisoners worked, a Tiger stood ten feet 
away with a cotton-wool beating rod in its 
hands. Prisoners were strictly forbidden to 
talk to one another. If a prisoner hesitated or 
faltered at work, he got a savage blow with 
the rod that singed the skin on his back. Like 
a mute, Poṉrāsā performed hard labor there 
in silence for three months, breaking stones 
from the fort wall, or carrying away sand and 
debris.
On the evening when the task of demolishing 
the fort was completed, Poṉrāsā was released 
by Tigers. “Captain, at least from now on, 
be loyal to Tamil Eelam,” he was advised. 
Poṉrāsā was expecting that they would return 
his ear studs with blue gems. But there was 
no sign of their return. On hearing the word 
“release” Poṉrāsā had returned to his old self. 
He raised his voice slightly to respond to the 
Tiger who had offered him the advice about 
loyalty, “My two ear studs with blue gems are 
with you. Keep them as my contribution to the 
struggle,” and left.
When she saw Poṉrāsā unexpectedly at night, 
Gñaṉammā was startled. The first question 
Poṉrāsā asked her was “did the army going 
to rescue the fort come to Suruvil?” When 
Gñaṉammā shook her head to say no, Poṉrāsā 
said, “That was exactly what I said back then, 
bitch. Your sons didn’t listen to me and fled 
to India,” and gave her a resounding slap on 
the cheek. The strength of the slap sent the 
blue-gem ear stud flying. It lay twinkling on 
the ground where it fell. Poṉrāsā bent down to</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

pick it up, asking “how did this come here?” 
Gñaṉammā said, “four months ago, the boys 
from the movement came to return them.” 
When Poṉrāsā went to lie down, Gñaṉammā 
lay next to him. She caressed his chest, put 
her head on it, and said “Christy and Bosco 
have gone to France from India. Hilda didn’t 
want her brothers to suffer. So she convinced 
her husband to call them to France within a 
month.”
On the eighth of May, at Muḷḷivāykkāl, 
just prior to the last stages of the civil war, 
Poṉrāsā kept nagging Gñaṉammā, “we can 
no longer stay here, the army will reach here 
at any moment; let us walk over to the other 
side through the sea.” “No, the boys will not 
let the army reach here, it would be wiser to 
stay put,” said Gñaṉammā. “The army will do 
nothing to you because you are a woman, it is 
me they will kill,” said Poṉrāsā in a frustrated 
voice. He sat down on the beach sand, took 
Gñaṉammā’s hand, and with a shaking finger, 
drew a map on the sand. “There are sand 
fortifications here, landmines here, and Tigers 
are here, this is the way the army is going to 
break through,” he explained to Gñaṉammā. 
That night, when Gñaṉammā woke up 
startled by the sound of explosions, Poṉrāsā 
was not lying next to her. Gñaṉammā sat 
up, shaken. At around three in the morning, 
Poṉrāsā came back stealthily, like a cat, and 
sat next to Gñaṉammā. In a hushed voice, he 
pleaded, “there are a few boats on the beach; 
we can abscond to the other side in one, will 
you come?” “If we stayed put, we will be 
shot at by only one side, if you start some 
mischief, we may draw fire from both,” said 
Gñaṉammā. “If I die, you take responsibility, 
you whore, dāsi aparañji,” said Poṉrāsā 
through gritted teeth.
Hilda, Christy, and Bosco were distraught, 
not having heard any news about their 
parents. One day there was a phone call from 
Vavuṉiyā. The message was that Poṉrāsā and 
Gñaṉammā were being held at a detention 
camp in Vavuṉiyā. The very next week, Hilda 
left Paris for Vavuṉiyā, She threw money 
around all over Vavuṉiyā, secured her parents’ 
release, and took them to Colombo with her. 
Within a month, she managed to get their 
sponsorship for immigration to France sorted 
out. Hilda boarded the plane to France with 
them.
Hilda’s family was in Paris. Christy and 
Bosco had a small shop each in the town of 
Saint-Thibault in southern France. Christy 
went over to Paris to bring Poṉrāsā and 
Gñaṉammā back to Saint-Thibault.
Saint-Thibault is a town of rivers. Christy had 
a house in the middle of the quiet woods by 
the banks of the river Thibault. The younger 
son Bosco’s beautiful house was a five-minute 
walk away. Their shops were close to each 
other by the highway.
Poṉrāsā fell in love with that milieu. By 
the following summer, he had transformed 
completely. He was once again the Poṉrāsā 
who lifted the Sinhala thugs and flung them 
away. At ten in the morning, he would drink 
a peg of whisky and walk from Christy’s 
house to Bosco’s house to boss his daughter-
in-law around. There, after downing another 
peg, he would return to Christy’s house for 
lunch and to boss around the other daughter-
in-law. The grandchildren went absolutely 
quiet when they saw grandpa’s reddened eyes. 
Christy and Bosco were still a little afraid 
of their father. “Aiyā, you drink as much as 
you want, but refrain from making noise,” 
they pleaded. Gñaṉammā spent her time with 
the grandchildren. The children competed 
with one another to buy jewelry and clothing 
for their mother. The blue-gem ear studs 
from Father Varapragāsam lay abandoned in 
Gñaṉammā’s box.</p>

Around midday one day, when Poṉrāsā was 
alone on the bank of the river Thibault, he 
saw that white boat. A french woman in 
her fifties was rowing the boat hugging the 
shoreline. Poṉrāsā lifted his hand in greeting. 
The woman, too, raised her hands to return 
the greeting with a smile.
The next day, at the same time, when the 
woman once again rowed along the riverbank, 
Poṉrāsā stood up and signaled her to stop 
the boat. When the woman stopped the boat, 
Poṉrāsā jumped into the river. The woman, 
alarmed, signaled him not to get into the 
water. Poṉrāsā waded through the water to 
the boat with a smile. When she held out a 
hand to help him get into the boat, Poṉrāsā 
nonchalantly brushed her hands away and 
lifted his long legs to climb over the side of 
the boat and topple into it. When the boat 
rocked violently, the woman crossed her 
heart and screamed. Poṉrāsā signaled her to 
be quiet. He touched his chest twice with his 
index finger and said, “captain.” The woman’s 
eyes widened as she broke into a smile. Her 
name was Agnès.
Agnès knew a hundred English words and 
Poṉrāsā fifty. That entire summer, they 
roamed around the river Thibault in that little 
boat. Sometimes they landed in the woods 
and lay down in the grass next to each other to 
bask in the sunlight.
Poṉrāsā called Agnès, ‘lady’ and Agnès 
called Poṉrāsā, ‘captain.’ Once they went 
to Christy’s and Bosco’s shops in Agnès’ 
car, He introduced her to them as his friend. 
One evening the following winter, on the 
white sheet draped over the beautiful, large 
Louis XV era bed in the bedroom of Agnès’ 
house, as Poṉrāsā lay asleep with his left arm 
embracing Agnès, his arm went limp, and 
Poṉrāsā died.
When Christy and Bosco arrived, Agnès 
was standing next to the bed crying. When 
Poṉrāsā’s body was lifted into the ambulance, 
Agnès ran over to hug Bosco, weeping. When 
Bosco patted her back to console her, Christy 
signaled to him with reddening eyes. Bosco 
did not understand that signal.
The room in the hospital where Poṉrāsā was 
kept was opened every day at nine in the 
morning and closed at eleven. Every day, 
Gñaṉammā and the children went there to sit 
by the room. Hilda fainted often. Christy and 
Bosco never told their sister or mother where 
Poṉrāsā was found dead. They just told them 
that he had a heart attack while lying down 
by the river. The brothers were relieved that 
Agnès did not show up at the hospital.
At midday on the day before the burial, 
everyone had gathered at Christy’s house 
chatting. Their relatives and friends from 
Paris would arrive for the funeral that evening 
and the next morning. They were discussing 
arrangements for housing and feeding the 
visitors. They expected no less than a hundred 
people for the burial. The front doorbell rang. 
When the door was opened, Agnès stood there 
with a small parcel. She had covered her head 
with a veil and stood there shivering. Bosco 
invited her in. She did not say much. She 
gave the parcel to Bosco and said, “if you can 
install this on Mr. Poṉrāsā’s grave, I would 
be fortunate,” and left. When Bosco looked 
through the window, she was walking through 
the frozen snow towards the banks of the river 
Thibault. 
Bosco carefully opened the parcel Agnès had 
given him. It was a small square slab of black 
marble intended to be installed on a grave. On 
it a picture of a boat’s helm was embossed in 
gold, with an anchor in the middle. Installing 
such a marble insignia in the graves of ship 
captains is a French tradition.</p>

Christy got up slowly, walked towards Bosco, 
took the marble slab from his hand, and 
slammed it on the floor. “If we install this on the 
grave, then people looking at this will think that 
we belong to the fisher folk caste,” he yelled. 
He kicked the marble slab which had broken 
into two. Hilda ran to her brother in anguish and 
held his hands. “Just leave it if you don’t like 
it, why are you getting so angry?” she asked in 
consternation. He pushed Hilda away violently 
and leapt towards the door. The force with 
which he slammed the door made the windows 
reverberate.
Little shrubs and grass grow on that 
grave that stands between the grave of 
a firefighter and the grave of a Chinese 
shopkeeper. There is no sign of who the 
grave belongs to.
The next summer, a woman was rowing 
alone in a small white boat along river 
Thibault. When sunlight fell on her face, 
the blue-gem ear studs in her ears glittered.
