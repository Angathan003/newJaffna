R
ecently, the renowned singer Hariharan's 
music show at the famous Muttraveli 
open arena in Jaffna ignited both excitement 
and controversy. The event was graced by the 
presence of celebrated actress Tamannaah, 
who performed her 'Kaavala' dance from the 
movie 'Jailer'. As expected, the performance 
electrified the youth in attendance. However, 
there was a degree of mismanagement on the 
part of the organizers, which led to the event 
being prematurely abandoned. The inability to 
control the overwhelming enthusiasm of the 
crowd ultimately resulted in the disruption of 
the show.

The show became a point of contention, with 
opinions sharply divided: some attendees 
celebrated the enthusiasm of the youth, while 
others expressed their disapproval. 
Adding a whimsical twist, photographs of 
several youths perched on a Palmyra tree 
and an electricity pole for a better view of the 
performance amused people across various 
Tamil-speaking districts in Sri Lanka and 
even in parts of Tamil Nadu. However, the 
event also drew fierce criticism from Tamil 
nationalist supporters and LTTE sympathizers, 
some of whom went as far as to denounce it as 
a ploy by the Sri Lankan government and its 
intelligence agencies to sway the mindset of 
Jaffna's youth.
We will not delve into the debate over the 
appropriateness of such musical shows. 
Instead, we offer a glimpse into history. On 
July 20, 1985, the Student Organization of 
Liberation Tigers (SOLT), the student wing 
of the LTTE, organized a large music show 
at the Chennai Nehru Indoor Stadium. The 
chief organizer of the program was Pulavar 
Pulamaipithan, the "Arasavai Kavignar" (poet 
laureate) of M. G. Ramachandran's (MGR) 
government.
The musical performance featured legendary 
composer Ilaiyaraaja and his younger brother 
Gangai Amaran. Legendary singers such as S. 
P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, Vani Jairam, 
Malaysia Vasudevan, Deepan Chakravarthy, S. 
N. Surendar, Kovai Soundarajan, S. P. Sailaja, 
and A. E. Manoharan, also known as Ceylon 
Manoharan, graced the event.
A vast audience gathered for the concert, with 
the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister taking on 
the role of an informal organizer. He issued 
directives to his officials, the police, and the 
media to ensure the event's grand success. 
Additionally, he arranged for notable actors 
such as Vijayakanth and Sathyaraj, along with 
a few actresses, to attend the event, further 
adding to its allure.
Remarkably, the Student Organization of 
Liberation Tigers (SOLT) managed to raise 
funds from this event, achieving a level of 
financial success that was unprecedented for 
the organization at the time. To facilitate a 
smooth experience for attendees, the Tamil 
Nadu government went the extra mile. Special 
buses were deployed to ensure participants 
could return home safely. Moreover, regular 
government bus services were extended until 
1 AM, specifically to accommodate those 
attending the event. Hundreds of Sri Lankan 
Tamils residing in Tamil Nadu flocked to the 
event, having been invited by the LTTE. 
So, everyone can relax - even the LTTE once-
organized musical shows featuring cinema 
stars.

Power, Paranoia, and Politics in the LTTE

Part 04
The curious case of Kirupan and the increasing 
paranoia about RAW 
In 1987, Kirupan, initially serving as a bodyguard to 
Prabhakaran, gradually garnered his trust and confidence. 
His ascent within the organization became particularly 
pronounced following Prabhakaran's definitive move from 
India to Sri Lanka in the same year. Recognizing Kirupan's 
loyalty and capabilities, Prabhakaran 1989 entrusted him 
with the significant responsibility of managing the LTTE's 
operations in India. 
Allegations point to Kirupan's involvement in the massacre of 
13 members of the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation 
Series</p>

Front (EPRLF), including 
Secretary-General 
Padmanabha, on June 
19, 1990. However, 
reliable sources relayed 
to the Jaffna Monitor that 
Kirupan was actually not 
informed about the attack 
on Padmanabha. This 
operation was orchestrated 
by the LTTE's intelligence 
wing under the leadership 
of Pottu Amman, with 
One-Eyed Sivarasan 
executing the plan. The 
assault team included 
David (Christopher Antony 
Mariythass- Polikandy-
Jaffna) and Ravi, a 1st batch trainee of tigers. 
(now residing in London), and Daniel is also 
alive, living somewhere in an overseas country, 
all under Sivarasan's command. 
Shanthan- one of the accused in the Rajiv 
murder case, worked as an informant. 
Credible sources within the LTTE intelligence 
wing, who were aware of the execution of 
Padmanabha's attack, 
have suggested to Jaffna 
Monitor that one of the 
leaders of the EPRLF, who 
is now a prominent Tamil 
Nationalist politician, also 
acted as an informant for 
Pottu Amman's team. This 
followed an agreement 
between Pottu Amman and 
the so-called politician, 
mainly encompassing the 
sparing of his life from the 
Tigers' attacks.
Pottu Amman, who became 
the head of the intelligence 
wing in December 1989 
and was fully operational by January 1990, 
deployed Sivarasan to India for specific 
missions and assigned Charles to Colombo 
for intelligence tasks. The assassination of 
Padmanabha, ordered by Pottu Amman, was 
the first major attack planned and executed 
under his direction. This incident was 
extensively documented by the LTTE. Credible 
sources told Jaffna Monitor that one assassin

took photos of the dead bodies of Padmanabha 
and his team with a film camera. This attack, 
along with the photographic evidence, served 
to consolidate Pottu Amman's position within 
the organization and strengthen his ties with 
Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran was particularly 
impressed with the way Pottu Amman's team 
executed the ruthless plan and photographed 
the dead bodies in detail.
In India, Kirupan's primary responsibilities 
involved acquiring essential resources for 
the LTTE, such as fuel, explosive materials, 
boat fiber, and medical supplies. A colleague 
from the LTTE, who worked with Kirupan in 
India, described him as a dedicated individual 
with an innocent appearance. However, the 
behavior of his subordinates often bordered 
on brutality. These individuals were known 
for their aggressive tactics, which included 
brandishing firearms at Tamil Nadu police, 
assaulting local residents, and even firing at 
vehicles on highways.
An enduring associate of the LTTE has shed 
light on the evolving relationship with the 
Indian Tamil community. Initially, the LTTE 
garnered support through shared cultural 
and linguistic connections, characterized by 
expressions of love and kinship. However, this 
approach underwent a transformation during 
the tenure of Raghu, Kiruban's predecessor in 
India. Kiruban, following in his predecessor's 
footsteps, shifted focus towards financial 
incentives for the Indian Tamils and, at times, 
resorted to violence with them to achieve his 
objectives.
In the early part of 1991, following these 
events, Kirupan was arrested near Neelangarai 
in Chennai and subsequently detained in 
Vellore jail. Kiruban reportedly escaped

while being transported under police escort 
from Vellore to the Pudukkoattai courts near 
Maraimalai Nagar. Upon returning to Jaffna, 
he captivated the LTTE leadership, including 
the LTTE supremo, with his dramatic escape 
story, reminiscent of a James Bond film. His 
return was celebrated by the LTTE supremo 
with a special lunch feast, and Kiruban was 
subsequently granted a leave of absence for a 
few months, during which he returned to his 
hometown of Point Pedro.
However, Pottu Amman harbored suspicions 
about Kiruban's escape. He had his informants 
engage with Kiruban and noticed discrepancies 
in the escape story told to Prabhakaran and 
himself compared to what was shared with 
his informants. Additionally, Kiruban's escape 
occurred after the assassination of Rajiv 
Gandhi, a time when security measures in 
Tamil Nadu were significantly heightened, and 
many LTTE associates were either arrested, 
went into hiding, or severed ties with the 
LTTE due to fear of repercussions from 
Indian authorities. Therefore, the feasibility of 
Kiruban's daring escape as he described it was 
questioned by Pottu Amman, casting doubt on 
the authenticity of his account.
Credible sources within the LTTE's intelligence 
wing revealed to Jaffna Monitor that Pottu 
Amman, armed with a file on Kiruban, 
approached Prabhakaran to request custody 
of Kiruban. Prabhakaran, already influenced 
by paranoia, readily agreed. Kiruban was 
subsequently subjected to severe torture and 
coerced into confessing that he was a Research 
and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW or RAW) agent 
and had attempted to eliminate Prabhakaran.
This confession was forced in a meeting 
attended by most of the leading members of 
the LTTE, sending a clear message about the 
consequences awaiting those who strayed from 
the organisation's line. Following this, Kiruban 
was eliminated. Pottu Amman harbored a 
conspiracy theory that RAW, India's foreign 
intelligence agency, had turned Kiruban into 
a double agent. He believed that Kiruban's 
supposed escape was staged by RAW and 
that Kiruban was assigned to assassinate 
Prabhakaran.
Many influential LTTE members still believe 
that Kiruban was indeed a mole planted 
by RAW. A former member of the LTTE's 
intelligence wing, who had extensively 
discussed Kiruban's case with the leaders of 
the intelligence wing, told Jaffna Monitor 
that Kapil Amman, Deputy Leader of the 
Intelligence Wing, Mathavan Master, Head of 
the LTTE Intelligence Training Centre, and 
Sangeethan, head of the intelligence wing's 
education wing (who was secretly referred 
to as 'Saguni' by intelligence wing members 
due to his cunning nature and tendency to 
speak ill of others to his boss, Pottu Amman), 
confirmed that Kiruban was indeed a mole 
planted by RAW. However, there is also a 
perspective within the LTTE that Kiruban 
was innocent and not an agent of RAW. A 
few prominent LTTE members who spoke 
with Jaffna Monitor believe that he indeed 
made a successful and daring escape, only 
to ultimately fall victim to Pottu Amman's 
paranoia. 
Regardless of the truth, this incident 
significantly heightened the paranoia of 
Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman towards India 
and RAW, leading to what was described as a 
'RAW Phobia' within the organization. This 
deep-seated fear prompted the LTTE to carry 
out numerous ruthless executions that would 
typically be unthinkable for any rational 
individual.
