Confronting Ethical Dilemmas in 
LTTE's Strategies
In 1978, I was in Ponnamman's house, 
in his room, along with Prabhakaran. 
Prominent LTTE members Raghavan 
and Sellakili were also present, though 
Ponnamman himself was not there. 
During our political discussion, Sellakili 
made a disturbing statement. He said, 
"Even young Sinhalese children should 
not be spared. They must be killed. 
They will grow up to kill Tamils. It's 
better to kill them while they are still 
children." This statement deeply troubled 
me. Sellakili, known for his technical 
knowledge and high regard within the 
LTTE, advocating such an extreme stance 
was bewildering. I argued that such 
actions were unethical and immoral; 
one should not entertain such thoughts. 
However, to my shock, Prabhakaran 
supported Sellakili's view, stating, "Those 
children will grow up to kill Tamils, 
so there is nothing wrong in killing 
Lt. Col. 
Ponnamman and 
Prabhakaran at a 
Training Camp in 
Tamil Nadu<br />

them now." This stance left me profoundly 
disheartened. As the argument intensified, 
Prabhakaran and Sellakili eventually left. 
Raghavan was also present, and contrary to my 
expectation that he would support my view, he 
agreed with Sellakili, asserting the necessity of 
killing Sinhalese children. Ragavan's mindset 
in this regard was deeply shocking to me.
After joining the movement in 1978, My 
school friend Ponnamman was appointed to 
oversee the LTTE's training camps in India 
starting in 1983. I recall a particular incident 
when I was at the sixth batch training camp 
in Mettur, Tamil Nadu. I came from the 
Military Office (MO) to test my prototype 
improvised devices: a Claymore Mine and 
an Anti-Tank Mine, which I named 'Piglet,' 
designed based on the shaped charge concept. 
During this time, Ponnamman was not present 
at the camp. In the camp, from a corner, I 
kept hearing pitiful cries. When I inquired, 
I found a young man tied with a rope being 
brutally beaten by the members who ran the 
camp. When I asked about his inhumane 
punishment, I was told that he was being 
punished for trying to escape 
from the camp. I stopped 
their beating and made them 
remove the rope. After several 
months, I learned the young 
man had been promised a 
boat to Sri Lanka. Then he 
was shot dead in the middle 
of the sea. This revelation 
filled me with rage. This 
would not have happened 
without the knowledge 
of Ponnamman and 
Prabhakaran. Ponnamman 
was my dear friend; there is 
no room for disagreement. 
However, I couldn't bear the 
thought of how he could allow 
this heinous crime. I felt sad 
and angry with him and thought karma would 
take its toll. Eventually, Ponnamman died in an 
explosion while refueling an explosive-laden 
LTTE bowser in Navatkuli  Jaffna. 
Anuradhapura massacre and its 
Underlying Politics
When I learned of the massacre of 146 
innocent Sinhalese civilians in Anuradhapura 
on May 14, 1985, I was absolutely devastated 
and sickened. While some argue that the 
killings were in retaliation for the Sri Lankan 
military's massacres in Valvettiturai, two 
wrongs do not make a right. This act is a war 
crime and a crime against humanity. But 
behind this killing, there is a story to tell.
Engagement with RAW and Ethical 
Confrontations
I was in Puducherry (Pondicherry) during 
the July 1983 riots when the Research and 
Analysis Wing (RAW) chief contacted me.

Later, when Prabhakaran came to India, 
he established a connection with RAW in 
Chennai. Subsequently, I decided to break 
off my contact, but Prabhakaran asked me 
to maintain it. I stayed connected until I left 
the LTTE. I would often ride to Pondicherry 
to discuss various issues. At one point, the 
RAW officer suggested that the LTTE should 
massacre Sinhala civilians. I was angered and 
refuted this idea, stating that our struggle was 
against the Sinhala regime, not the civilians. 
When I met Prabhakaran and discussed this 
issue in Chennai, he informed me that RAW 
had also made similar requests to him. 
A couple of months after our conversation, 
the Anuradhapura massacre occurred. 
Balasingam, the official spokesperson, issued 
a statement denying the LTTE's involvement 
in the killings. In my subsequent meeting 
with the RAW officer, he congratulated me 
on the brutal act. This left me in a dilemma: 
either RAW genuinely wanted the massacre 
to occur, or they were evaluating the LTTE 
to understand its motives. Following the 
incident, they might have been reassessing 
the LTTE, or they might have genuinely been 
offering congratulations. I cannot conclusively 
determine their true intentions.
However, I didn't delve further into the matter. 
At that time, I was deeply engaged in military 
development and research at the Military 
Office (MO). Shortly after the Anuradhapura 
killings, the first Thimbu Talks commenced. 
Prabhakaran tasked me with representing the 
LTTE in these talks alongside Tilakar, who 
worked in my MO. Years later, two or three 
of the LTTE who participated in the killings 
admitted to me that they had conducted 
the attack and how they had escaped. I have 
always been vehemently against the killing of 
innocent Sinhalese civilians.
I came across accusations in the Sri Lankan 
media that Pulendran, the then LTTE leader 
in Trincomalee, had been killing Sinhalese 
civilians. During a meeting with him in 
Jaffna, I confronted Pulendran about this and 
sternly warned him that I would shoot him 
on the spot if he continued attacking civilians. 
Notably, in the late 1970s, I interviewed both 
Pulendran and Seelan for recruitment into the 
LTTE while in Trincomalee. I chose Seelan 
as a new member but had reservations about 
Pulendran due to his immaturity. Despite my 
decision, someone else later recruited him into 
the LTTE.
INDIAN ARMY'S ARRIVAL, 
THILEEPAN'S HUNGER STRIKE...
When the Indian Army arrived in Sri Lanka, 
Tamil people welcomed them with garlands, 
drums, and music. The relationship between 
the Indian Army and the Jaffna people was 
initially cordial to the extent that if the 
LTTE attacked the Indian Army, the people 
themselves would retaliate against the LTTE. 
Prabhakaran wanted to disrupt this friendly 
relationship.
You need to understand that we did not 
initiate an armed struggle by placing our 
trust in India. India bears no responsibility 
for resolving the Tamil issue in Sri Lanka. 
Whether the goal is Tamil Eelam or a federal 
state, the reality is that a complete military 
victory is unattainable. Ultimately, all parties 
must come to the negotiating table. Western 
powers and the Soviet Bloc allowed India a 
free hand in dealing with Sri Lanka, a fact 
made clear to the Tigers by both blocs. India 
achieved its objective by bringing Sri Lanka 
under its foreign policy influence through the 
India-Sri Lanka Agreement (an agreement 
between India and Sri Lanka, not with the 
LTTE).</p>

Part of the Indo-Sri Lanka Treaty recognized 
the traditional land of the Northern and 
Eastern Tamils of Sri Lanka and annexed it 
as a province for the Northern and Eastern 
Provincial Governments. Many unresolved 
issues are left for future negotiations 
regarding the devolution of power for the 
Tamil province. Prabhakaran was wrong if 
he expected India to hand Tamil Eelam on a 
silver platter. It was Prabhakaran's fault if he 
misguidedly believed Tamil Eelam could only 
be achieved through 100% military victory 
without foresight.
During the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord period, 
it's a fact that the LTTE secretly brought in 
an arms shipment without the knowledge of 
both the Indian and Sri Lankan governments, 
despite LTTE's denials. On one side, the 
LTTE feigned the surrendering of weapons 
to the Indian Peace-keeping Force while 
simultaneously smuggling in arms. The Sri 
Lankan Navy's interception of this shipment 
led to the arrest of 17 LTTE members, 
including Kumarpappa and Pulendran. Many, 
like Pulendran, had merely gone to view the 
ship. Prabhakaran exacerbated the situation 
by providing cyanide capsules to these 17 
members on October 5, 1987. Tragically, 13 of 
them died. I view this cyanide incident as an 
unnecessary loss of life. 
Prabhakaran created all the violations and 
dramas to destroy the entire process. Thileepan 
might have genuinely desired to sacrifice his 
life, hoping to achieve something beneficial 
for the Tamil people. However, Prabhakaran 
manipulated Thileepan's intentions for his 
own political ends. I was with Prabhakaran 
on the day Thileepan began his hunger strike. 
Prabhakaran asked Kasi Anandan and me to 
escort Thileepan to the hunger strike site in 
Nallur. After Thileepan's death, Prabhakaran

directed Kasi Anandan and me to hand 
over his body to the Faculty of Medicine 
in Tirunelveli. I conveyed his body there, 
where Rajini Thiranagama, head of the 
Department of Anatomy, along with the 
other Doctors, received it.
The five demands made by Thileepan 
during his hunger strike were not major 
or complicated. The solution was on 
the card of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord. 
Forming an interim government and 
confining the Sri Lanka army back 
into barracks, etc., needed some time 
to settle. Both Thileepan's hunger 
strike and the cyanide incident were 
orchestrated by Prabhakaran to incite 
the Tamil population against the Indian 
army. This strategy ultimately proved to 
be successful.

Evaluating the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord 
and LTTE's Strategy
India is not the adversary; Prabakaran 
deliberately orchestrated the prevailing 
situation. As a result, the Tamil community now 
endures losses far more significant than what 
they initially encountered, with effects that are 
expected to linger for two to three generations. 
Unfortunately, post-1980, the central committee 
of the LTTE lost its effectiveness, paving the 
way for Prabakaran to consolidate his position 
as the sole leader. It's common for individuals 
to develop an inflated sense of self-importance 
upon gaining a modicum of fame and power, 
a tendency comparable to a 'messiah complex.' 
This complex is characterized by an individual 
believing they are, or are destined to become, a 
savior with a grand mission, often leading to a 
disconnect from reality and rational decision-
making.
