No culture can live if it attempts to 
be exclusive. Mahatma Gandhi
Background: The post-
independence history of many 
countries that faced colonial rule 
has many commonalities. In the 
Indian sub-continent, having faced 
the dehumanising consequences of 
colonial rule together, the ‘Brown-
sahibs’ - of all sides, created 
divisive narratives that enabled 
them to consolidate their positions 
within the power hierarchies of 
their communities. ‘WE had a 
unique and pure culture which was 
polluted, diluted or bastardised 
by THEM’ was the message given 
to the electorates, and this ‘US 
Vs THEM’ narrative pervaded 
all aspects of political discourse, 
periodically spilling over as large 
scale violence. Even though the 
minority communities bore the 
brunt of these violent outbursts, 
all segments of society suffered 
its multi-faceted consequences. 
It was easy to create a culture 
of nepotism, corruption, and 
economic mismanagement as 
all criticisms against this trend 
could be deflected and the blame 
shifted to ‘THEM’. This divisive 
narrative included falsification 
of history creating an illusion of 
multiple ‘pure cultures’ that were 
contaminated and degraded by the 
arrival of the others. All aspects 
of social life – religion, language, 
food habits, art, music and dance 
included, were seen through 
the prism of ‘US Vs THEM’. For 
example, the identical mixture of

Co-evolution of 
musical traditions

mung beans, brown sugar and spices when 
fried in oil in the shape of spherical balls came 
to represent the Tamil culture (‘Payaththam 
paniyaram’ or gaj;jk; gzpahuk;) but 
when shaped into a flat squares, triangles or 
rhomboids (Mung Kavung or uqx lejqka) came 
to represent a strong Sinhala culture and the 
differences were deemed irreconcilable. To 
any neutral outsider, the conflict between the 
groups was no different to the wars between 
the “little endians” and “big endians” in 
Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels! 
The fallacy of this approach needs to be 
confronted if we are to truly appreciate the 
multi-dimensional, inclusive and inter-
dependent manner in which history and 
cultures evolved. The musical history of Sri-
Lanka provides a window of opportunity to 
do so, for the music of the land – practiced 
in all nooks and corners of the country, is 
truly a product of inter dependence and co-
evolution. Traces of every form of music can 
be seen in every other form of music, if only 
we take the time and effort to look for these 
commonalities.
Jim Sykes, a musicologist from the University 
of Pennsylvania refers to the aesthetic system 
that emerged across the island, among all 
its people as a system of ‘Musical Gift’ (The 
Musical Gift: Sonic Generosity in Post-War 
Sri Lanka, Oxford University Press 2018). In 
this way of thinking, “some sounds are meant 
to be given, in that they can be shipped and 
tracked as they move, given or bought and re-
gifted by one person to another, and enjoyed 
through this transition but not construed as 
inherently expressive of the soul of the person 
or community or geographical location that 
offers it”. In other words, what Sykes implies 
is an open and seamless system where sounds 
and expressions have moved freely across all 
boundaries, accepted, adapted and adopted 
by individual practitioners. Given this general 
background, the rich tapestry that resulted in 
the island can only be described as something 
that co-evolved amongst all the island’s 
inhabitants. The Musical gifts came from far 
and wide – North and South India, Africa, 
Europe and the Far East, and these gifts were 
accepted and indigenised. 
The music of the Vedda: The Vedda (Ntlu; or 
jkaksh,e;af;da) community is considered to 
be the indigenous people of the island nation. 
Their history predates 6th century BCE and 
are the hunter-gatherers who lived in the 
forests and caves. Genetic studies have found 
that the Vedda are genetically closer to some 
Indian tribes than to Sinhala or Sri Lankan 
The identical mixture of boiled Mung beans, brown sugar and a variety of spices when fried in the shape 
of flat squares, triangles or rhomboids came to be known as ‘Mung Kavung’ and when fried in the shape of 
spherical balls came to be known as ‘Payaththam Paniyaram’ with strong cultural connotations amongst 
the Sinhala and Tamil groups respectively. (Adapted from Google Images with Thanks)</p>

Tamils and as such they could be considered to 
be part of an ancient group(s) of people who 
lived in the subcontinent and surrounding 
islands. The Vedda communities, displaced 
from around the entire country, currently live 
in small villages scattered around the Eastern 
and North-Eastern slopes of the central 
hills and in the North Central province. 
Dambana, Rathugala, Pollebedda, Dalukana, 
Henanigala, Vakarai, Muttur, Anuradhapura 
and Panama are some of the areas where the 
Vedda communities currently live in relatively 
small numbers.  The early musical practices in 
the Vedda community is hard to determine, 
even though it is safe to speculate that simple 
wind instruments, percussion instruments 
and string instruments may have been in use. 
Ramayana refers to the use of Yarl (or the 
harp) and the Veena in ancient Lanka in the 
royal courts and, there is no reason to believe 
that similar instruments may not have been 
used by the ordinary citizenry too. 
Drumming certainly has been practiced 
extensively within the Vedda communities for 
purposes of communication, entertainment 
and in religious ceremonies. The shapes of 
these drums amongst the different Vedda 
subgroups sheds an interesting insight into the 
importance of external influences in shaping 
these drums. Whereas the communities 
that lived in close proximity to the Tamil 
populations in the East – such as Vakarai, 
use drums that are similar in shape to the 
‘Tamilised’ drum – the ‘Mattalam’ (kj;jsk;), 
others who lived in close proximity to 
established Sinhala communities in the 
more central regions tend to use drums that 
resemble the ‘Davula’ (ojq,) or the ‘Gata 
Beraya’ (.eg fnrh) – commonly used 
by Sinhala musicians (Sykes 2018). This 
illustrates, how the musical practices of a 
neutral community such as the Vedda, who 
were uninfluenced by the political rhetoric 
of the urban middle classes, was shaped by 
the surrounding environment through the 
seamless flow of musical traditions between 
people who live in close proximity. Saying 
that the Vedda music has been shaped and 
influenced by the musical practices of other 
communities does not deny the existence 
of musical traditions within the Vedda 
community or undervalue the quality of those 
native musical traditions. But rather, it means 
that these traditions and practices have been 
in a state of continuous flux through sonic 
donations and Musical giving.      </p>
<p>The Parai and the Bera: Parai (giw), is the 
traditional drums of the Tamil people living in 
South India and in Sri Lanka. Until the arrival 
of the Thavil to Sri Lanka in the latter half of 
the 18th century, the Parai music was at the 
heart of communal events – socio cultural 
as well as religious. The communities that 
played the Parai once held a more respected 
status within the Tamil society which was 
progressively eroded by the pernicious effects 
of the caste system inherent within Hinduism. 
As a result, the status of Parai, and other 
stigmatised drums such as ‘Urumi’ (cWkp) 
was significantly downgraded along with 
that of the community who performed the 
drumming. This down grading was more 
pronounced in the Northern Province than 
in either the Eastern Province or amongst the 
Tamils living in the Hill country – referred to 
as the ‘Malaiyaga Thamilar’ (kiyaf jkpou;). 
Despite such distortions, Parai music was in 
widespread use in Hindu temples all over Sri 
Lanka – including those dedicated to Shiva. Its 
current use in temples is however limited to 
the non-Agamic temples dedicated to Shakti, 
Amman or the mother goddess. In the Eastern 
province however the Parai music forms 
an integral part of a form of street drama, 
commonly known as ‘Parai Mela Koothu’ (or 
giw Nks $j;J) – a tradition of dancing 
with the Parai and a short double reed wind 
instrument called the Sornali. The versions 
of drums used in this context would include 
the traditional Parai, Udukkai (or cLf;if),</p>

Urumi (a drum similar but slightly longer 
than the Udukkai), maththalam (kj;jsk;) 
and Tappattam (or jg;gl;lk;). Koothu, 
incidentally is a form of story-telling using 
music and dance as the medium of expression. 
This genre of street performances is known 
as ‘Theru Koothu’ (njU$j;J) whose origins 
can be traced to the Sangam period (300BCE-
300AD). Many such Koothus, usually named 
after the lead character in the story – Kaman 
Koothu, (fhkd;$j;J), Kathavarayan Koothu 
(fhj;jtuhad; $j;J) etc., are integral to the 
Tamil culture in Sri Lanka, whose influences 
have been far reaching, extending beyond the 
Tamil community.
Similar percussion instruments – known 
as the Bera, have also formed an important 
component of social life amongst the Sinhala 
speaking communities in Sri Lanka. Broadly 
speaking, three distinct forms of Bera 
traditions can be identified in Sri Lanka 
(though a musical purist may be able to name 
many more different traditions). These are the 
Low Country (or Pahata Rata, approximately 
between Horana to Matara), the Up 
Country (Uda Rata, or the central hill region 
surrounding Kandy) and the Sabaragamuwa 
– an intermediate zone around Ratnapura. 
Whereas the Yak Bera (a straight drum with 
lower tone) is integral to the Low Country 
drumming, the Gata Bera (with tapered ends 
and a higher tone) is mostly integral to the 
Up Country drumming. Both the Yak Bera 
and the Gata Bera are played with the two 
hands. The drum that is indigenous to the 
Sabaragamuwa region is the ‘Davula’, which 
is played with one hand and a stick. Locally 
available wood (Jack, Kohomba and Ehela etc.) 
and animal hide (buffalo, cow, goat, monkey or 
monitor lizard etc.) are used in drum-making. 
According to Sykes, “All three major Berava 
drums are performed in highly hallowed 
Buddhist contexts in their respective regions, 
such as chant ceremonies (pirit), peraheras 
and rituals for deities (deva tovils) held at 
shrines (devales) ”. In this context, the term 
‘Bera’ refers to the drum and the ‘Berava’ refers 
to the caste of the drummers. The Berava 
usually perform the role of ritual specialists, 
and sounding the drums is an integral part of 
these rituals. The rituals are usually aimed at 
seeking the blessings of deities (Deva tovils) 
or wading off evil spirits (Yak tovils) who can 
cause harm – including disease, pestilence, 
drought and famine. Traditionally, the Berava 
caste was assigned a subservient position 
within the social hierarchy, despite the

rejection of the caste system within Buddhism. 
The Up Country Berava are considered 
superior to their Low Country counterparts 
as the Kandyan rituals focus on gods, whereas 
the Low Country rituals focus on appeasing 
demons and evil spirits. In addition to 
drumming, the Berava people also function 
as astrologers and folk healers well versed in 
Ayurvedic and other traditional medicines. 
Despite the multitude of roles played by the 
Berava people, the main societal role assigned 
to them was to honour the king and other 
divine sovereign powers through musical 
offerings. 
 
According to Sykes, the Berava drumming 
prevailed within a wider context of musical 
giving. As a result of the close proximity 
between Buddhism practiced in Sri Lanka 
and the four deities (‘Hatara varam deviyo’ – 
Vishnu, Natha, Pattini and Kataragama) who 
held delegated authority (varams), the Berava 
music had multiple intersections with Hindu

the times of the kings (with Hindu roots) 
who ruled the Kandyan and Kotte Kingdoms. 
The structural similarities between the Parai 
and the Davula; the use of other similar 
instruments such as the ‘Thammattama’ 
and ‘Tappattam’; the structural similarities 
between the Gata Bera and the Mrdangam 
drum played in carnatic ensembles; the 
common use of Udukkai and Mattalam 
within both communities and the subservient 
position assigned to the Berava and Parayar 
communities strongly imply that these musical 
and social traditions have co-evolved and 
form part of a common heritage. Arguing for 
a common heritage merely acknowledges the 
fact that the development of these traditions 
are multi-faceted and does not imply the 
absence of rituals or musical traditions that are 
indigenous to each group. </p>
<p>The Koothu and the Nadagam Traditions:<br />
It is fair to say that the art of story-telling 
using music is common to the Sinhala and 
Tamil speaking communities. In fact, one 
may reasonably argue that the traditions 
that underpin Tamil ‘Koothu’ and Sinhala 
‘Nadagams’ are two sides of the same coin and 
the observations made by Sykes in this context 
are reproduced below.
“Koothu embodies a geographically broad 
history of musical giving from Tamil 
Christians to Tamil Hindus, from Tamil 
speaking Christians to Sinhala speaking 
Christians and from Sinhala speaking 
Christians to Buddhists and secularists. The 
genre emerged from South Indian “street 
theatre” (terukoothu or njU$j;J) that was 
adopted by Jesuit priests for their Portuguese-
derived Passion plays and by Tamil Hindus 
for performances of Hindu epics……From 
there the genre travelled down the west coast 
to Mannar and Chilaw where the Sinhala 
speaking Christians turned it into a genre 
called Nadagam…... The Nadagam was then 
popularised as a secular genre by Phillippo 
Singho, whose well-known play Ehelapola 
Nadagama was produced in 1824…..Dr 
Edmund Peiris (former Bishop of Chilaw) 
argued that the Sinhala Nadagam dates back 
at least to M S Gabriel Fernando’s staging of 
Raja Tun-kattuwa (rdc ;=kalÜgqj) in Chilaw 
in 1761, a Nadagam modelled on the Tamil 
Natakam (i.e Koothu) ‘Muvirasakkal natakam’ 
or %-,uhrhf;fs; ehlfk;, about the birth 
of Christ. Nadagam’s popularity declined in 
the late 19th century in the wake of visiting 
Parsi theatre troupes from Bombay, who 
bequeathed a local genre called ‘Nurthi’ that 
would become an important site for a renewed 
Sinhala identity…… The music in Sinhala 
Nadagams was heavily Tamil in flavour, 
drawing on South Indian carnatic music and 
the Koothu, and it used the same drum as the 
Koothu, which the Tamils call maththalam (or 
kj;jsk;) and the Sinhalese call maddalaya or 
Demala Bera (Tamil drum)”. 
Interests in Sinhala Nadagam resurfaced in 
the 1950s with the staging of ‘Maname’ in 
1956 and ‘Sinhabahu in 1961 by Professor 
Ediriweera Sarathchandra. Whereas ‘Maname’ 
is based on the Buddhist Jataka story about 
the former life of the Buddha, ‘Sinhabahu’ 
is based on the legendary forefather of the 
Sinhala people. Sarathchandra was an artistic 
innovator who drew from global theatre 
including Indian and Japanese theatre and 
true to his academic integrity acknowledged 
that his Nadagams were rooted in the Tamil 
Koothu. He is reported to have travelled 
to areas in the country where Koothu was 
practiced and “to learn about Koothu for his

The Carnatic and Hindustani Traditions: 
Ariyapala in his thesis to the University of

the state of society in the island nation in the 
13th century as depicted in the Saddharma 
Ratnavaliya and other literature from the 13th 
century. Parakramabahu II, was the leading 
figure from this period, and Ariyapala has 
the following to say about his reign. “The 
Chulavamsa gives a glowing account of his 
life and activities. It refers to his crushing of 
the alien foe, after which he set himself to 
bring about prosperity of Lanka. He built a 
temple for the Tooth relic near the palace, and 
having deposited the relic there, held a great

festival in its honour. He cleansed the ‘church’ 
of corrupt practices, expelled evil doers and 
brought erudite monks from India to restore 
order. The Chulavamsa, describing his work 
in this respect says: ‘All the corrupt groups of 
bhikkhus …….were dismissed from the order, 
and thus purified the order of the perfectly 
enlightened one. Then the king sent many gifts 
to the Cola country and caused to be brought 
over to Tambapanni many respected Cola 
bhikkhus who had moral discipline and were 
versed in the three Pitakas”. 
In discussing the religious environment 
at the time, Ariyapala is very clear that 
Buddhism was the dominant force amongst 
the royal households as well as laity and that 
erudite monks played a prominent role in 
society. He however also makes the following 
observation. “Buddhism was so much of a 
sophisticated philosophy…” and as a result 
“the common man, grasped various non-
Buddhist beliefs and practices from Hinduism 
and Brahmanism” (M B Ariyapala, Society 
in Mediaeval Ceylon 1956) in dealing with 
their day to day mundane challenges.  These 
accounts clearly illustrate an environment 
of harmony and co-existence where free 
exchange of ideas and practices were possible. 
In discussing music and dance in the 13th 
century Ceylon, Ariyapala states “there is not 
the slightest of doubt that Kalas appertaining 
to music – vocal (gita or .S; or rhfpj;a 
,ir), instrumental (jdÈ;  or thj;jpa 
,ir) and dancing was widely cultivated”. The 
Vina was played very frequently and other 
instruments mentioned include the several 
types of Bera (or giw), Mattalam (or maddala 
or the Tamil drum), mrdangam, Udukkai, 
Kulal (or flute), horanava and tambour (or 
the Tampura) etc. The Thupa-vamsa even 
mentions – amongst a list of many other 
musical instruments, the nāgasara (ehfRuk;), 
kombu (nfhk;G), kaitalam (ifj;jhsk;), 
ottu (Cj;JFoy;) as instruments that were 
in use at the time. It is clear that many 
of the instruments listed above are now 
identified with traditional Tamil music and 
its widespread use in 13th century Ceylon is 
relevant. Given this integrated environment 
where the ‘Sri Lankan’ music flourished in the 
13th century through the interactions between 
‘Sinhala’ and ‘Tamil’ forms of music, it is 
surprising that attempts were made in post-
independence Sri Lanka to identify Hindustani 
music as the basis of Traditional Classical 
Music of Sri Lanka. All existing evidence 
suggests that the connection with Hindustani 
music commenced only after the period 
1930-1950, when a number of musicians 
from Sri Lanka visited the music academy 
Shanthinikethan founded by Rabindranath 
Tagore to be trained in Hindustani Music. The 
elevation of this genre of music, which arrived 
in the country only in the 20th century, as 
the traditional music of the Sinhala people 
must therefore be seen as an imperative that 
existed amongst some middle class pseudo-
intellectuals to establish a “considerable 
ancestral and geographical distance between 
Sinhalese and Tamil cultural traditions” (Jim 
Sykes 2018).      </p>
<p>Conclusion: The intention of this article is not 
to provide a complete overview of all musical 
traditions that form part of the cultural 
tapestry of Sri Lanka. The stark gaps in the 
narrative presented - including the omission of 
popular musical traditions such as the ‘Baila’ 
and cinema-music, is acknowledged. However 
for the purpose of presenting a narrative of co-
evolution and joint heritage, it was necessary 
to stick to classical art forms and it is hoped 
that the case presented is adequate to initiate 
greater discussion and debate. Such a debate 
is essential if we are to appreciate the historic 
role music has played in Sri Lanka in binding 
communities together. Acknowledging this 
historic reality and creating such an inclusive 
narrative is a pre-requisite if the country is to 
move forwards and realise its true potential.</p>

the beatific silence of the night, it lay there 
listlessly, like the life of a widow.
The passionate, youthful feelings that had 
lain dormant all this time broke through 
the sentiments of pity and snowballed into 
something greater.
‘At least for today, let this lamp be lit in the 
hut,’ her heart resolved.
As her footsteps drew closer, a voice stirred to 
life from within the hut.
“Is that you, Rāyilā?”
“Yes! Yes!”
“Why so late today?”
“What can I do? How can I always come 
home early? Do I have a husband who's 
gathered and bundled the firewood for me?”
Rāhilā snapped at him. The man who was 
curled up in the plain straw mat regretted 
asking.
He struggled to bury his hurt deep within his 
chest, only for it to erupt as a red-hot sigh.
Rāhilā took the edge of her saree to dab away 
the beads of sweat on her face. The nagging 
feeling that her response had been tainted with 
unnecessary cruelty played hide-and-seek 
within her.
With a sense of duty, she lit the lamp, and a 
dull light spread within the hut. In that light, 
Rāhilā’s eyes searched for the curled-up 
figure. It was not an unfamiliar figure. It was 
the figure that occupied the place of ‘Rāhilā’s 
husband’ for the past five years.
The wellspring was breached.
Compassion trickled forth!
‘The poor soul,’ her heart was anguished.
“Are you ok?”
The conversation they just had completely 
slipped from her mind. His heart became light 
as a feather; he was like a toddler scrambling 
into his mother’s lap after being punished.
“Rāyilā! I think I have a fever today. My chest 
feels tight, too, and I feel weak. Make me a 
little porridge with some broken rice.”
It took a Herculean effort for him to finish 
uttering these words.
Immediately, he was stricken by the thought of 
being on the receiving end of her sharp tongue 
with a retort like, ‘The Lord and Master 
demands porridge now, does he?’
For the past six or seven months, snapping 
at him no matter what he said had become 
second nature to Rāhilā. But today was 
different. Without a word, she complied with 
his request and began making porridge.
The clay stove caught the spark from her 
matchstick and began belching smoke. Rāhilā 
puffed up her cheeks and blew into the stove, 
wiping the smoke from her eyes. Her efforts 
were rewarded when a flame abruptly leapt up 
and spread.
Rāhilā’s husband thought her body shimmered 
like gold in the light of that little flame.
He was sitting up with his back against the hut 
wall, his solitary leg stretched before him.
The pain weighed heavily on his chest, making 
him pant.
The pillow that supported his neck and 
head brought him comfort, but gazing at the 
exquisite beauty of his wife from this new 
angle sprouted a thorn bush in his heart.</p>

As the fire took hold in the stove, Rāhilā 
walked back into the living space of the 
hut. The flowery silk saree and the velvet 
blouse they had bought for her wedding lay 
abandoned in the storage box. She picked 
them up with newfound fondness and laid 
them out to air on the coir clothesline.</p>
<p>A soft light began to spread, heralding the 
rise of the crescent moon. In her heart, too, an 
unfamiliar dull light began to spread. Rāhilā 
returned to the clay stove and crouched before 
it. They did not exchange a single word, but 
these two hearts often communicated more in 
silence than in words.
Rāhilā rinsed the rice in the arikkimilā, the 
metal pot for cleaning rice, to remove gravel, 
then poured it into the pot on the stove, and 
began mixing it.
He could not take his eyes off Rāhilā.
One cannot just introduce Rāhilā merely as a 
woman. She possessed the allure of a mango 
that had ripened on the tree amidst a cluster 
of others. When she smiles, it is impossible to 
take one's eyes off the beautiful dimple that 
forms on her left cheek. He always thought 
she was the desert flower upon which God 
chose to imprint His unique stamp of beauty.</p>

She was his cross-cousin, which meant she 
was an eligible match for him in a society 
that permitted such marriages. Beguiled by 
her beauty, he courted her persistently. When 
he finally won her hand, he felt the pride of 
having all the world's riches heaped at his feet.
He felt a few inches taller, his chest fuller. As 
a lumberjack, when he walked to and from 
the jungle carrying small woven baskets full 
of snacks—the hallmark of a new groom—he 
exuded a unique majesty, like an emperor 
surveying the domain of his heart.
It was like the captivating light show of 
a rainbow, or the exquisite beauty of a 
water droplet shimmering like a pearl on 
the edge of a blade of grass… yet he was a 
simple, uneducated man, lacking the poetic 
imagination or the eloquence to describe the 
incredible life he had been gifted.
One day, he returned from the jungle, hobbling 
on his right foot. He laughed it off, saying 
a branch had struck his knee while he was 
chopping down a tree. Perhaps he believed 
that Rāhilā’s charming smile would be the 
soothing balm to heal his injury. But reality 
grabbed that belief by the horns and shook 
it mercilessly. The wound festered, dragging 
him to and from the Puḷiyantivu hospital for 
months, until his right leg was amputated, 
leaving him confined to the straw mat at home 
as a permanent patient. In the process, their 
meager possessions and the few pieces of gold 
that once glittered on her body all vanished.
Rāhilā built a hut on a plot of sandy, barren, 
government land and began her life, hoping to 
find fulfillment by being there for her husband 
and caring for him.
The satisfaction she once found in realizing 
the dreams of her youth vanished into thin air, 
like a dream itself. Her youthful yearning left 
her feeling exposed, with a bitter taste at the 
back of her tongue. She wore her status as a 
wife like armor and joined the ranks of women 
who earned a living on their own by collecting 
and selling firewood.
This arduous life continued for a few years, 
withering the flower of her life, petal by petal. 
But today, the fangs of the problem have risen 
up like a giant apparition.
The porridge boiled on the stove. The events 
that transpired earlier that day also smoldered 
and spread their tentacles.
Rāhilā had gone to the water’s edge to wash 
up. When she returned, carrying a bundle 
of firewood, the horizon was decorated in 
crimson to bid farewell to the sun.
Her first thought was, ‘Today is the day to 
deliver firewood to the village headman Ali’s 
house.’ The thought of that house made her 
shiver involuntarily from embarrassment and 
shyness.
She threw the bundle of firewood by the 
kitchen and drew water from the well to 
quench her thirst. Just then that village 
headman’s driver, Karim, appeared from the 
direction of the garage. Over the past eight 
months, it had become customary for him 
to await her arrival, and for her to await his. 
They both knew this, but neither expressed it 
in words.
The light that shone through the gap in the 
open garage door painted Rāhilā in a golden 
hue. She squinted and asked, “Have they gone 
somewhere?”
“Today is their nārisā at the mosque, offering 
free meals to the faithful. That is why the boss 
and his wife are out.”
As his mouth answered mechanically, his eyes 
lingered on her blouse, taking in the sight 
of her youthful, buxom figure that the fabric 
struggled to contain.</p>

The complete self-realization struck her 
like lightning. She regarded her own body 
with newfound fondness. For four years, her 
husband had not been able to worship this 
body—the body that resembled a freshly 
bloomed flower, made firmer and stronger by 
the hard daily labor…
Shyness and modesty; Fury followed 
instantly!
She felt that the way he was undressing her 
with his eyes was obscene. Yet at the same 
time, a certain titillation tantalizingly tickled 
her.
In that moment, their eyes exchanged the 
timeless emotions surging within them.
The ecstasy born of forgetfulness was 
shattered by the birth of a sudden realization.
The faint memory of her husband lying in the 
cottage.
“Tell the headman that I have brought the 
firewood. Please give me some money if you 
have,” she mumbled each word hesitantly.
“OK, come inside!” Karim closed the door 
further as he went back into the garage.
Rāhilā’s suppressed emotions, long resigned to 
regarding the corporeal pleasures of youth as 
a mere mirage, began to bubble up whenever 
she saw him. In the beginning, her husband’s 
kind face and his disability joined forces to 
steady her wavering resolve.
But as time went by…
Whenever she lay down with her husband, 
Karim’s handsome face and his constant smile 
began to weave through her imagination as 
cross threads.
Eventually, the fortress was completely 
breached. The silent pleasure of offering her 
body to Karim in her imagination had begun 
to pervade her entire being.
She realized that Karim was inviting her in 
to take advantage of this rare opportunity for 
them to be together alone. She followed in the 
footsteps of his desire and entered the garage.
Inside, a beatific silence connected them. They 
were so close that they could feel each other's 
breath. He looked at her as if overwhelmed by 
the urge to drink in her beauty with his eyes 
alone.
“Are you going to swallow me?” she teased 
him with a smile.
“Rāyilā! I know your situation. I tried to talk 
to you so many times. But today I finally got 
the opportunity. Tell me if you agree.”
Until now, it had been Karim’s gaze that gave 
her the impetus to want to escape the prison of 
her anguished life. Now the third person has 
become the second person, speaking to her 
directly. A desperate hope budded in her heart 
and slowly began to grow.
“If you promise in the name of Allah that you 
won't forsake me, I will follow you.”
The words burst through her lips, surprising 
her.
“Rāyilā!” he exclaimed as he embraced her 
tightly fulfilling his long-held desire. She lost 
herself in his embrace, powerless to resist his 
hands that were moving downwards from her 
waist. Muffled voices from the street outside 
reminded them that the garage they were in 
was not isolated from human habitation.
“What if the headman returns abruptly?” she 
hesitated.
“I, too, forgot. It is indeed time for them</p>

to return. Take the money for the firewood 
directly from him. We don’t want to arouse 
any suspicion. But keep this!” He thrust a 
five-rupee note into her hands. She hesitated 
again.”
“From now on, everything I earn is for you,” 
he forced the rupee note into her palms. She 
relented and took it.
“Rāyilā! Don’t forget. I’ll wait for you by the 
banyan tree just as the early morning train 
blares its siren.”
Until now, throughout this interaction, she had 
remained like a motionless statue. Now she 
hung her head to indicate agreement. Her legs 
started walking away.
Rāhilā took the porridge off the fire, poured 
it into a bowl and began cooling it down. The 
siren from the paper mill blared, filling the 
entire area with its shrillness. Rāhilā looked 
at her sleepy husband and said, “Here, it is 
almost ten o’clock. Get up and have some 
porridge before you sleep…”
He slurped the porridge while leaning against 
the thatched coconut-leaf fence – “Rāhilā you 
suffer because of me. But God will not make 
you suffer forever. One day you will see your 
dawn.”
He washed his hands and curled up on his mat 
once again.
The oil lamp belched thick smoke. A cluster of 
dark clouds slowly consumed the moon, which 
had reached its zenith.
The mist covered everything, as if a white silk 
awning had been draped over the world.
Rāhilā could clearly hear the first notes of 
birdsong welcoming the auspicious dawn.
She went to the well to do her morning chores.
The image of Karim waiting for her by the 
banyan tree filled her mind, spreading like a 
wall-to-wall carpet. 
She retrieved the flowery silk saree and velvet 
blouse from beneath her mat and put them on, 
admiring the completeness of her own beauty.
Finally, out of habit, she glanced through the 
gap in the door – her husband’s hands, anemic 
from the disease that was consuming him, lay 
facing upwards in desperate appeal to God. 
Teardrops welled in his eyes and slithered 
down his cheeks like a necklace of pearls. His 
dry lips parted…
“My creator! Forgive the sins I committed 
knowingly or unknowingly and save me 
from damnation, Rahumān! Have mercy 
on my wife, relieve her from the trials and 
tribulations she suffers because of me. Grant a 
good life at least to her, Rahmān!”
Rāhilā felt unable to move, as if her feet had 
sunk roots into the ground.
She thought of her husband who, despite being 
reduced to the state of a worm squirming in 
the mud, still showered her with love and 
compassion…
A newfound courage and resolve enveloped 
her.
She secured the five-rupee note in a knot at 
the edge of her saree. If she went to the village 
headman Ali’s house, she needed to return it to 
Karim.
An old pot climbed on to the new fire she 
made on the stove.</p>
