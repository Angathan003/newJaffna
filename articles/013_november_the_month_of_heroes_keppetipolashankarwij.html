November: The Month of Heroes
Keppetipola–Shankar–Wijeyweera
I
n the month of November, we might not have observed 
that three individuals are commemorated in Sri Lanka on 
remembrance days. The remembrance days of Keppetipola, 
Sankar, and Wijewira all happen to fall within this month. 
These three individuals share the commonality of having been 
killed in the struggle for liberation.
Keppetipola can be seen as a martyr for Sinhala 
nationalism, Sankar for Tamil nationalism, and Wijewira for 
“internationalism.” On November 26 each year, Keppetipola’s 
remembrance day is observed, and in 2015, President 
Maithripala unveiled a statue in his honor on this day.
Liberation Tigers fighter known as Lieutenant Sankar, or 
Selvachandran Sathiyanathan, sustained a fatal stomach injury 
in battle, passing away on November 27, 1982.

JVP leader Rohana Wijewira, who was in 
hiding, was captured at Ulapane and secretly 
shot and burned near the Borella Cemetery on 
November 13, 1989.
In Sri Lanka’s history, heroes who fought 
against British rule and sacrificed their lives 
are often celebrated not as national heroes 
but primarily as Sinhala heroes. Key figures 
include those from the Uva Rebellion, such 
as Keppetipola (1818), Veera Puran Appu 
from the Matale Rebellion (1848), and 
Utuwankande Sura Saradiel (1864). These 
are among the most prominently celebrated 
figures. Sura Saradiel, famously known by the 
British as Sri Lanka’s Robin Hood, stole from 
the rich to aid the poor and was ultimately 
captured and executed for resisting British 
rule. Films and even television series in 
Sinhala have portrayed these three figures. 
Songs about Saradiel, sung by renowned 
artists like Jothipala and the recently deceased 
maestro Visharada Amaradeva, are also well 
known.
Though more than two centuries have passed 
since Keppetipola’s execution, his annual 
remembrance day continues to be observed 
at his memorial, located in the courtyard of 
the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Dalada 
Maligawa) in Kandy, where he was beheaded.
A few years ago, when Karuna Amman was 
arrested, Udaya Gammanpila held a press 
conference in protest, drawing a comparison 
to Keppetipola. He stated:
“Karuna Amman is like our Keppetipola—a 
man who came from darkness into light, from 
the wrong side to the right side. He is one of 
the champions of the freedom we enjoy today.”
This article is intended to explore the story of 
that very Keppetipola.
In recent times, Sinhala nationalists have 
promoted “Veera Keppetipola” on a mass scale, 
often with underlying political motives. He is 
not merely remembered as a Sinhala freedom 
fighter against British colonialism; there is a 
narrative claiming that it was the Muslims who 
betrayed this heroic figure. This adds a layer</p>

of significance that limits Keppetipola’s legacy, 
narrowing him to a hero celebrated solely 
by Sinhala Buddhists, rather than by all Sri 
Lankans. His remembrance day has thus been 
turned into a commemorative event tinged 
with ethnic sentiment.
The rebellion he led is known in Sinhala as 
the “Uva-Wellassa Freedom Struggle” or 
the “Great Uprising of the Hill Country.” 
At the end of this struggle, the British 
captured, executed, imprisoned, or exiled 778 
individuals as punishment.
The last Sinhala king to rule Kandy was Sri 
Vira Parakrama Narendra Singha (1707-1739). 
Without an heir, he arranged for the crown 
to pass to the Nayakar dynasty through the 
brother of his queen, Sri Vijaya Rajasinha, who 
was brought from Madurai and ruled from 
1739 to 1747. Following him, the Nayakar 
dynasty saw the reigns of Kirti Sri Rajasinha 
(1747-1781) and Rajadhi Rajasinha (1781-
1798). (These Tamil kings of the Nayakar 
lineage, who spoke Telugu, were referred to by 
the Sinhalese as Vaduga kings.)
After the death of Rajadhi Rajasinha in 1798, 
the king expressed a wish for his queen's 
brother, Muthusamy, to succeed him. However, 
the Chief Minister (known as the Maha 
Adigar in Sinhala), Pilimatalawa, had his own 
ambitions for the throne. Pilimatalawa, who 
belonged to the Nayakkar Vamsa (nNayakkar 
Dynasty), anticipated that the other ministers, 
many of whom opposed him, would insist that 
a member of his lineage assume the throne.
In his bid to place a compliant ruler on the 
throne, Pilimatalawa identified Kannusamy 
as the ideal candidate. Kannusamy was the 
brother of one of Rajadhi Rajasinha’s wives 
and was born in Rameswaram. Upon his 
father’s death, Kannusamy came to Sri Lanka 
with his uncle, Kondasamy, and resided in the 
area allocated to the Nayak dynasty within the 
Kingdom of Kandy.
Before publicly announcing the king's death, 
Pilimatalawa visited Kannusamy, securing 
his cooperation. Only then did he inform the 
ministers of the king’s demise and the selection 
of the new ruler. Though initially shocked, the 
ministers eventually agreed to the plan. Thus, 
at the age of 18, Kannusamy ascended the 
throne under the name Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.
Dreaming of reclaiming power from the 
Tamil rulers of Madurai and establishing a 
Sinhala monarchy, Pilimatalawa sought to 
control the young king. However, as time 
passed, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha grew aware of 
Pilimatalawa’s schemes and began disregarding 
many of his counsel. Tensions among the 
ministers increased, and conspiracies against 
the king persisted, fueled by various internal 
conflicts.
Amid increasing pressure from the British to 
capture Kandy, Pilimatalawa secretly began 
corresponding with the British Governor, 
Frederick North, plotting to overthrow the 
king. Pilimatalawa’s aim was to seize power for 
himself through a pact with the British.
The British, meanwhile, proclaimed 
Muthusamy, who was under their protection, 
as the rightful king of Kandy. Believing Kandy 
to be captured, they advanced, but the king 
regrouped, launching a fierce counterattack. 
Unable to withstand this assault, the British 
retreated. Many were captured, including 
Muthusamy, who had acted as a guide for the 
British forces. The king sentenced Muthusamy 
and those who fought alongside him to death, 
executing them as traitors.
A web of plots followed one after another. 
Though enraged at the British for declaring 
Muthusamy king without his consent, 
Pilimatalawa found himself helpless. At one 
point, he even requested the king’s approval</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

to marry the daughter of one of Kirti Sri 
Rajasinha's wives to his own son, a proposal 
the king saw through and promptly rejected.
After twice forgiving Pilimatalawa’s 
assassination plots, the king finally acted 
when a third conspiracy was uncovered with 
witnesses. Pilimatalawa was arrested, and his 
trial took place in 1811. Key officials, including 
Molligoda and Keppetipola, sat in on the 
tribunal, presided over by the king himself. 
Ultimately, Pilimatalawa was sentenced to 
death. Ironically, he was executed by the very 
king he had once placed on the throne.
Pilimatalawa’s son-in-law, Ehelepola, was 
appointed to the position of Chief Minister. He 
had married Kumarihami, Keppetipola’s sister. 
Like Pilimatalawa, Ehelepola also continued 
conspiracies against the king, aligning himself 
with British officials. Legend has it that as 
punishment, Ehelepola’s wife Kumarihami 
and their children were executed, with tales of 
them being crushed and beheaded in a mortar. 
(However, many Sinhalese scholars argue that 
no evidence supports such a brutal execution, 
which is another part of the story.)
With Ehelepola’s collaboration, the British 
captured Kandy in 1815. Sri Vikrama 
Rajasinha, along with his queens and mother-
in-law, attempted to escape to the remote 
area of Medamahanuwara but was betrayed 
and arrested on February 18, 1815. Following 
his transfer to Colombo, the British and the 
Kandyan chieftains, led by Ehelepola, signed 
the Kandyan Convention on March 2, 1815.
The first three clauses of the Kandyan 
Convention are noteworthy. They stipulated 
that the “Malabar” (referring to Tamil kings 
originating from Malabar) king, Sri Vikrama 
Rajasinha, was deposed, that no member of his 
Tamil lineage would henceforth be allowed to 
ascend to the throne, and that all male relatives 
of his lineage were to be expelled from the 
country.
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was detained in 
Colombo until he was exiled to Madras 
aboard the Cornwallis on January 25, 1816. 
The ship reached Madras on February 21, 
from where he was taken to Vellore and held 
in confinement until his death on January 30, 
1832.
The Kandyan chieftains who had trusted the 
British and signed the agreement soon realized 
they had been deceived. After the Kandyan 
Convention, Molligoda was appointed Chief 
Minister, Ehelepola became the Governor of 
the Hill Country, and Keppetipola was made 
the Governor of Uva. However, as rebellions 
against the British began to stir across villages, 
the British sent a force led by Keppetipola to 
Uva on November 17, 1817, to suppress the 
uprisings.
Upon encountering the fervent Sinhala rebels, 
Keppetipola had a change of heart. He handed 
over his weapons and the British flag to his 
soldiers, dismissed them, and joined the 
rebellion himself, taking up leadership in the 
fight against the British. Other chieftains soon 
joined him, including Ehelepola. In response, 
the British stripped Keppetipola and 16 other 
leaders of their titles, seized their properties, 
and issued a bounty for their capture, offering 
rewards to anyone who would hand them over.
During this period, Keppetipola made two 
announcements to rally the people to his 
side. First, he claimed to possess the “Sacred 
Tooth Relic of the Buddha,” which he said he 
had received through Sumangala Thera and 
was keeping safely. This, he asserted, gave 
him legitimate authority to rule. Second, 
he announced that the rightful heir of the 
Nayakar dynasty, Duraisamy—known as 
“Wilbawe”—was with him. This confused the 
British, who launched an investigation and 
discovered that this was a fabricated story and</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
65
that the real Duraisamy was in Madras. The 
British publicized this, revealing that the local 
Wilbawe was merely a Buddhist monk and not 
a true Nayakar heir.
The British eventually obtained the Sacred 
Tooth Relic, which led to a loss of faith among 
the people, as they believed that whoever 
held the relic had rightful authority. (Even 
today, it is customary for election winners to 
visit the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic to 
receive blessings.) With this blow to morale, 
the rebellion began to falter. The British then 
deployed forces from Madras to crush the 
insurgent forces, gradually suppressing the 
rebellion.
One day, a Muslim merchant visiting the 
village where Keppetipola was staying noticed 
unusually tight security and patrols, unlike 
what he’d typically seen in the local areas. 
After spending the night observing, he passed 
this information on to the British, leading to 
Keppetipola’s capture on October 23, 1818, 
after a surrounding operation.
On November 26, 1818, Keppetipola was 
beheaded near the Bogambara Lake in Kandy. 
Before his execution, he visited the Temple of 
the Sacred Tooth Relic for his final prayers. He 
reportedly instructed the executioner to sever 
his head with a single stroke. The British took 
Keppetipola’s skull to England for study, and in 
1954, following requests from his family, it was 
returned to Sri Lanka.
Ehelepola was exiled to Mauritius, where he 
eventually passed away.
In Sinhala historical narratives, Keppetipola 
is portrayed as a freedom fighter who 
opposed British imperialism and sought to 
establish a Sinhala Buddhist state. However, 
renowned historian Ralph Pieris, in his work 
Sinhalese Social Organization, establishes that 
Keppetipola’s lineage traces back to a family 
that arrived from Malabar with a Tamil king. 
Pieris also affirmed in a Sunday Leader article 
(October 18, 1998, p.11) that Keppetipola was 
indeed Tamil.
 The political motivations behind elevating 
Keppetipola in commemorations during 
November, a month of remembering heroes, 
must be understood in the context of this 
background.</p>

Story
How terrible!
“Sundaram was hit by a car near 
the post office. It ran over him, 
leaving him severely injured 
and unrecognizable…”
Murthy stopped listening and 
took off like a bolt of lightning 
toward the scene of the 
accident. By the time he arrived, 
a large crowd had gathered. He 
pushed through to the center but

could hardly bear what he saw.
“Aiyō aṇṇā!” his wail shook the entire 
neighborhood.
His beloved brother—his only brother—lay in 
a pool of blood. Just five minutes earlier, he 
had left home saying, 'I’m going to the post 
office, I have an important letter to mail.' Now, 
he lay there, motionless, speechless, lifeless…
Yes, he was dead. Nothing more than a corpse 
in the middle of the street.
He who was here yesterday was gone today. 
He who is here today may be gone tomorrow. 
Life is merely an illusion, nothing but a web 
of lies.
Murthy was shocked into philosophizing.
Friends and family sobbed uncontrollably, 
unable to hold back their grief. Sundaram’s 
sudden demise had shocked and saddened 
everyone. It was no surprise that the loss of a 
good man caused so much pain and grief.
Murthy could not hold his grief back either. 
Tears, tears, everywhere.
‘My dearest brother is no more. My brother, 
who sacrificed his comforts to ensure a 
comfortable life for me, whose only wish was 
that I should live a happy life, has left me, our 
family, and this world itself.’
Murthy could not bear his grief.
‘How he struggled to give me an education! 
What obstacles he faced to help me find a job. 
He paid the price of sacrificing his comforts 
only because he wanted to see me succeed.’
Choking back his sobs, he glanced at what was 
laid out on the desk. He had been handed the 
items that were in Sundaram’s pocket at the 
time of the accident. 
A wallet, a pen, and a letter.
Sundarams had been using that pen and the 
wallet for a long time. 
What was this?
— Murthy was surprised to notice that the</p>

letter was addressed to a woman.
Was he corresponding with a woman? Did 
he, too, have a romantic liaison like everyone 
else? Cheche! It can’t be anything of that sort.
Something in Murthy’s heart urged him to 
read the letter.
He opened it and started to read.
“My Darling Sarasvathi…,” Murthy was 
taken aback by the opening.
‘Aṇṇā had a lover?’
Overcome with disbelief and shock, he read 
the entire letter:
My Darling Sarasvathi
I bring you good news. The goal that 
made me postpone our wedding—my life’s 
goal—is finally on the verge of fruition. 
You may recall that I vowed to marry 
only after completing my responsibility of 
educating my brother Murthy and helping 
him find a job. That has come to pass. He 
is about to start his new job on the first of 
next month.
I'll visit your home next week to meet 
your mother and ask for your hand. We’ll 
arrange the wedding right after that. You 
can wait, can’t you?
I understand the risk in delaying our 
wedding, and I feel your pain every 
moment. It’s true we made a mistake in 
a moment of weakness, but I share that 
responsibility. You trusted me, and I will 
never abandon you.
Saras, don’t worry about anything. We’ll 
be married before the truth comes out, 
and no one will judge us after that.
Yours
Sundaram.
Murthy reread the letter countless times. His 
surprise at discovering that his brother had a 
lover instantly gave way to grief as he learned 
of Sundaram’s resolve not to marry until 
Murthy had graduated and secured a job.
Che! Sundaram never had the good fortune to 
enjoy the satisfaction of achieving his dream. 
His life was taken before he could see his 
brother start a job.
Murthy felt there was something hidden in 
the letter that he did not quite grasp. But no 
matter how many times he read it, he could 
not figure out what it was.
He wondered how Saraswathi would grieve 
when she heard of Sundaram’s passing. How 
could he summon the courage to deliver such 
shocking news? Yet, he knew he must.
He recognized the village name in the 
letter’s address as the location of the school 
where Sundaram had been teaching until the 
previous month, when he transferred to a 
school in his own village.
Who was that woman?
Perhaps their liaison began at school?
The riddle seems to be slowly unraveling.
Murthy had heard that Sundaram was a 
lodger at someone’s house while he worked 
at that village school. He had eaten and slept 
in that house. He had heard that the house 
belonged to an elderly widow whose husband 
had recently passed away. The widow had a 
daughter.
Could it be her?
Murthy guessed that it might be her. Whoever 
it was, they needed to be informed of 
Sundaram’s death. Murthy thought it only 
proper that he himself went there to deliver 
the bad news.</p>

one who was to enrich your life had his life taken away from 
him’ or ‘The hands that you hoped would hold you have been 
incinerated’?
What could he say? How could he say it?
She must have noticed Murthy’s discomort. She started the 
conversation herself, “Sundaram master has told me a lot about 
you. Even though he was staying with us for such a long time, it 
is only today that you found your way here,” she laughed.
‘It is not as if I am making a pleasant social call today. I bear 
horrible news. You are laughing now, but in a minute, you are 
going to wail,” Murthy lamented silently.
He had no option but to say something. In a shaky voice, he 
asked, “Are you Sarasvathi?”
“Yes, at least you know my name! Did your brother tell you 
that?”
Murthy’s heart howled again. He steadied himself. He must tell 
her the news.
He located the house i and 
stepped in through the 
front entrance. There was 
no one about.
When he called out for a 
second time, he heard a 
feminine voice respond, 
“Who is there?” Presently 
a young woman appeared, 
dazzling Murthy.
What a beauty!
Beauty had taken refuge 
within that woman. She 
was very attractive, despite 
not wearing any makeup. A 
certain indescribable charm 
radiated from her calm, 
understated presence.
Murthy recovered 
somewhat to say, “I 
am Sundaram master’s 
brother,” and stuttered, 
unable to continue.
Her eyes lit up, “Is that so? 
Come in, come in,” she 
invited him in and showed 
him to a chair.
Murthy sat down, still 
unsure how to break the 
news. All the preparation 
he had done for this 
moment evaporated 
instantly. He was 
sweltering.
How could he begin this 
conversation? He was at a 
loss.
Should he say, ‘The one to 
whom you gave your heart 
has forsaken you’ or ‘The</p>

“I came to tell you something, but I don’t 
know how to begin,” he hesitated.
“Don’t worry, just say it out loud,” she 
encouraged him.
‘Would she say this if she realized the horror 
of the news I bring? Aiyō, your grief is going 
to overwhelm you!’
“My brother… Sundaram.. He …last Saturday 
… he passed away,” Murthy spat out the 
words in fits and starts.
She reacted exactly as he had feared. Before 
he could even finish speaking, she let out a 
scream unlike any he had ever heard.
Somehow Murthy managed to tell her 
everything that had happened.
She sobbed, sniffed, screamed, and wailed.
Murthy sobbed along with her. He stopped 
grieving for his brother and began grieving for 
her.
They drowned in tears.
After what seemed like an eternity, Murthy 
handed her Sundaram’s last letter. When she 
heard that Sundaram met with the accident 
on his way to post this letter, her grief only 
became deeper.
She read the letter and sighed. Staring into 
nothingness, she moaned, “He has left me, but, 
but…”
Murthy felt that she was holding something 
back.
“But what?” he asked.
“But I can never forget him. It will be a 
symbol of our eternal love, that symbol…”
“What do you mean?” Murthy stuttered.
“That symbol is being formed…”
“Tell me in a way I can understand…”
“In… my.. belly…”
Murthy felt as if the sky collapsed in on him. 
He regarded her in shock.
Now he could read between Sundaram's lines 
in a way he hadn’t been able to before.
His brother’s flesh and blood is growing 
within her womb.</p>

What now?
“Does anyone else know about this?” asked 
Murthy.
“No one. Not even my mother knows about 
our relationship. Your brother lived here 
like a member of the family. Therefore 
neither my mother nor anyone else suspected 
anything…”
Her words were caught up in her throat.
She was silent for a few moments, but 
continued, “But sooner or later everyone will 
find out…”
In his mind's eye, Murthy could visualize that, 
sooner or later, her life would be destroyed, 
and the world would spit on her and call her a 
whore.
‘Must the world label her a fallen woman? 
Does she not deserve a promise of a future 
like everyone else? Can she not live like every 
other woman? Is there no salvation for her?
Murthy closed his eyes and immersed 
himself into a deep trance, oblivious to his 
surroundings.
Silence reigned for a long time.
A profound silence.
‘There is a way. There is only one way in 
which she can find salvation.’
From some corner of his heart, a voice said, 
‘Murthy, your brother Sundaram lived for 
you. Your happiness was his happiness. He 
dedicated his life for you. He even postponed 
the chance to wed his beloved for your sake, 
and lost that happiness forever. For him to rest 
in peace, for the sake of your dear brother, 
wouldn’t you do this?’
He opened his eyes as though he had reached 
a firm resolution, and his face shone with an 
extraordinary light.
He looked at her with unshakable resolve 
and, in a quavering voice, said, 'I’ve come to 
a decision after careful thought. If you don’t 
object…'
“If I don’t object…?”
“I want to marry you myself.”
She was stunned and could not speak.
Silence. A long silence.
She struggled to turn her tumultuous emotions 
into words. Deep within her chest, words 
tripped over one another and festered.
Murthy looked at her face.
He could not tell if what he saw on her face 
was joy or surprise or shock or wonder.
After a long lapse, she started speaking again.
“Have you really thought this through?”
“Yes, I have. As far as I am concerned, it is a 
decision cast in stone now.”
Again, silence.
She said, “You are selfless.”
He looked into the distance, smiling to 
himself, and muttered, “More than my 
brother?”</p>
<hr />
<p>Everyone was aghast at Murthy’s behavior. 
Not even a whole month had passed since 
Sundaram died. Murthy started his new job 
only a week ago. Yet, he had started planning</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

his wedding. Who would not be surprised at 
such behavior?
People could not make sense of how Murthy 
could go from uncontrollable grief at 
Sundaram’s funeral to seeking the earthly 
pleasure of a wedding so soon.
No one could understand why he wanted 
to take on responsibility for another human 
being, even before he had drawn his first 
salary, even before he had set his finances on a 
firm footing.
But it did not matter what the world thought 
of it. Everything happened the way Murthy 
had wanted. Without any traditional wedding 
rituals, without the bustles and banquets of 
wedding ceremonies, Murthy wed Sarasvathi 
in the company of a handful of relatives.
He felt relieved to have shut the world’s mouth 
preemptively.</p>
<hr />
<p>The baby was born.
Everyone—except Murthy and Sarasvathi—
worried about the potential for a premature 
baby to run into health complications.
Everyone thought the baby looked just like 
Murthy.
That was no surprise, was it?
The baby sat on Sarasvathi’s lap, waving its 
tiny arms at Murthy and smiling beatifically.
It seemed to want to tell them, ‘I, too, know 
the secret of my birth, not just you two!’ 
Sarasvathi lifted her head to look at Murthy.
Her glance was filled with wordless gratitude 
saying, ‘You are selfless.’</p>
