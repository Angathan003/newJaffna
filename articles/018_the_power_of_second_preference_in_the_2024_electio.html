F
or the first time in Sri Lanka's history of 
presidential elections, there is a strong 
possibility of the need to count second and 
third preferences of the votes cast in favour of 
the candidates, barring the top two who get 
the first count at the 9th presidential election 
slated for September 21, 2024.
Although there are 38 candidates in the fray, 
most independent observers are of the view 
that the election will be a 4-cornered contest 
among the leading candidates, President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, who stands as an 
independent candidate, Sajith Premadasa of 
Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake of Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) 
and Namal Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka Podujana 
Peramuna (SLPP).
Wickremesinghe got a massive boost when 
92 MPs, the vast majority of them SLPPers, 
extended support to the United National 
Party (UNP) leader, who is contesting as an 
independent candidate. This came immediately 
after the decision taken by Rajapaksas to field 
young Namal. Even Wimal Weerawansa, most 
vociferous opponent of Wickremesinghe, 
grudgingly acknowledged, "Ranil, who was 
at the bottom has suddenly rose in the list of 
candidates". Wickremesinghe's advantage is 
that he brought the economy back on the rails 
and ended the shortage of essential items.
According to exit polls, none of the candidates 
will get a clear 50% + one want, which is

required to score an outright victory in the 
first count. This did not happen in the first 
eight presidential elections from 1982 to 2019, 
as there were only two leading candidates at 
each election and one of them crossed the bar. 
Hence, there was no requirement to count the 
second and third preferential votes to decide a 
winner.
However, this time, the scenario is different. 
Most exit polls and opinion polls predict 
less than 40% of the votes for the leading 
candidate, with 15% to 30% for each of the 
other main contenders. Most analysts agree 
that there is no clear-cut winner, and the race 
for the presidency is turning into a multiple-
horse race.
In a scenario where none of the candidates 
secure more than 50% of the votes, the 
significance of the second preference becomes 
paramount. While Sri Lankan voters eagerly

anticipate the opportunity to exercise their 
democratic rights this year—after two other 
elections, for provincial councils and local 
government, were postponed due to legal, 
economic, or other unspecified reasons—the 
average voter is not accustomed to recording 
second or third preferences in a presidential 
election.
The candidate who polls more than 50% of the 
votes is declared the winner. If no candidate 
secures more than 50%, the second-choice 
votes of voters will be counted. In this case, 
the votes cast for the losing candidates, except 
for the top two, will be reallocated based 
on the second and third preferences. These 
preferences will be added to the vote totals of 
the first two candidates to determine the final 
winner.
In a recent media interview, former Election 
Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya 
explained the process in simple terms. If there 
are five candidates—A, B, C, D, and E—with a 
total of 100 valid votes, let's assume A receives 
40, B gets 35, C has 15, D polls six, and E gets 
four. After the first count is completed, the 
contest is between A and B, as they are the top 
two candidates. These two are considered the 
remaining candidates. The second or third 
preferences marked on their ballot papers are 
no longer considered in the second round 
because they are now the only candidates 
left, while the others are eliminated from the 
contest.
Then, the counting of the ballot papers marked 
for C will take place first. In case, a voter has 
marked his first preference to C and second 
to A or B, it will be considered as a vote for A 
or B. Then, this ballot paper is inserted into 
the ballot box meant for A or B. The third 
preference marked in this ballot paper is not 
considered. Also, a ballot paper marked for</p>

C as the first choice bears second or third 
preferences to D or E; it will not be considered 
because these two are not in the contest or 
are eliminated candidates. Similarly, in the 
event of a voter marking first preference to C, 
second to D or E and third to A or B, it will be 
considered a vote to A or B as third preference.
The ballot papers cast for C, D, and E are 
checked for second and third preferences and 
validly marked for A and B.
If we assume that A gets three additional votes 
with his total moving up to 43 and if B gets ten 
more additional second preference votes will 
have a total of 45. The grand total is now 88. 
Out of it, B gets more than 50 percent and is 
declared President. If any of the two does not 
get additional votes after counting second and 
third preferences, the candidate 'A', who has 
the highest number in the first round itself will 
be declared winner.
In the unlikely event of a tie, where both A and 
B get an equal number of votes, the Election 
Commission can finally resort to a raffle draw 
to select the winner.
Voters can indicate their preferences by 
marking 1, 2, or 3 in front of the symbols of 
their chosen candidates. However, if they use 
an 'X' to mark their first choice, they cannot 
use their second and third preferences (2 and 
3). To use all preferential votes, they must 
avoid marking an 'X.' For example, if someone 
marks their first choice with an 'X' and then 
marks their second and third choices as 2 and 
3, their vote will be invalid.
The second preference will help a candidate 
who polled at last 40 per cent in the first round 
because even if the second preference vote is 
distributed evenly among the first two, the 
candidate already ahead could forge ahead 
to be the winner. However, if someone's first 
preference vote hovers around 30 per cent or 
less, he would require bulk voting in his favour 
as the second preference. 
The voters, whether Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim, 
will be able to safeguard their interests by 
casting second preference, in addition to 
casting their first vote for the most favourable 
candidate, as it will doubly ensure that the 
vote will not be wasted. For example, if you 
have a favourite candidate in mind and, while 
voting for him, if you have doubts about his 
victory, you can cast a second preference for 
another candidate who has better chance than 
your first choice. Furthermore, if you feel that 
one of the first two leading candidates would 
not serve the interests of your community, 
you could cast your second preference to the 
other leading candidate in order to prevent the 
former candidate from being elected.
If a voter wants to cast their first preference 
for a candidate from their community, but is 
aware that this candidate is unlikely to win due 
to a lack of nationwide support, they can cast 
their second preference for a leading candidate 
to ensure their vote is not wasted. By doing 
so, the voter can safeguard the interests of 
their community or religious group while still 
expressing their first preference among the 
candidates.

A Dying Child, A Silent Crowd: 
Can We Really Expect 
System Change?

O
n September 10, 2024, around 3 
PM, the heat of the sun was at its 
peak. A friend, on his way to the Medical 
Faculty, noticed an unusual traffic jam on 
Aadiyapatham Road in Kokkuvil. Since 
the area is home to several wedding halls, 
he initially thought the congestion might 
be due to a wedding. At that moment, 
someone passing by remarked, 'It's lying 
ahead on the road,' and the shift in the 
expressions of those standing around 
suggested that an accident might have 
occurred.
Struggling through the crowd on his 
motorcycle, my friend pushed forward to 
see what had happened. A young girl who 
had been riding a bicycle was struck by 
a tipper and lay on the road, clinging to 
life. Not a single person had rushed her 
to the hospital; instead, they just stood 
there—watching. Without hesitation, my 
friend dropped his bag and helmet, lifted 
the girl into his arms, and desperately 
pleaded with the onlookers and passersby 
for help. But no one moved, no one 
offered a hand. They simply watched as 
her life slipped away.
Yet, no one stepped forward to help. 
Finally, with the assistance of a passing 
motorcyclist, my friend rushed the girl 
to the hospital. Even as they transported 
her, her condition was rapidly 
deteriorating. Despite the best efforts of 
the doctors and nurses in the emergency 
department at Jaffna Teaching Hospital, 
it was too late—the girl had passed 
away. Her mother, unaware of the tragic 
news, frantically searched every bed in 
the hospital, desperately hoping to find 
her daughter alive. Witnessing this, my 
friend's heart shattered.
Had the girl been taken to the hospital 
immediately after the accident, her 
chances of survival would have been 
significantly higher. But the fact that not 
a single onlooker stepped forward to help 
is deeply disturbing. It's heartbreaking to 
think that this young girl could have been 
the same age as their own daughters. Yet, 
with chilling indifference, they turned 
their vehicles away, treating her like 
a lifeless object—some even casually 
saying, 'It's lying there,' as if her life 
meant nothing.
If it had been their own family member, 
would they have stood by so coldly? 
Those who constantly demand 'system 
change' fail to see that real change must 
begin within themselves. How can people 
who express outrage over the loss of life 
in distant places turn a blind eye to the 
death unfolding right in front of them? 
This wasn’t just a death caused by an 
accident—this was a murder committed 
by the apathy of those who stood there 
and watched, doing nothing.
