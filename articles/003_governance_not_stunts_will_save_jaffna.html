Governance, Not Stunts, Will 
Save Jaffna
J
affna MP Ilangumaran of the ruling National People's 
Power (NPP) recently orchestrated an ill-conceived stunt 
that seemed straight out of an amateur Tamil action movie. 
Late one night, with an air of self-styled heroism, the MP 
chased down a lorry, overtook it with dramatic flair, and 
forced it to the nearest police station, accusing it of illegally 
transporting limestone. Yet, in an ironic twist worthy of a 
comedy, the vehicle was found to be lawfully transporting 
gravel for a reputable business in Jaffna.
Had the NPP still been in opposition, such antics might 
have been perceived as a bold attempt to raise awareness or 
draw attention to an issue—noisy but ultimately harmless 
political theatrics. However, Ilangumaran is now part of the 
ruling government, and his actions carry a different weight, 
raising uncomfortable questions. Does he lack confidence 
in his government's ability to address illegal mining 
through proper legislation? Or is he implying that the police 
force under his party's rule is so ineffective that MPs must 
resort to dramatic stunts to enforce the law themselves?
Adding to the confusion, the Cabinet Minister of 
Fisheries and the NPP's lead figure in Jaffna, Ramalingam 
Chandrasekar, commented on the incident. Initially 
claiming to have warned Ilangumaran not to act in such 
a manner, Chandrasekar later stated, "Now I feel what 
he did was right" (loosely translated). This shift in stance 
from a senior Cabinet minister raises an even more 
troubling question: Does Chandrasekar also lack faith in his 
government's ability to take tangible action against illegal 
resource exploitation? If so, is he suggesting that every MP 
should take matters into their own hands and stage their 
own stunts?

Instead of grandstanding, Ilangumaran and his party should focus on 
drafting and implementing laws to stop illegal sand mining, mineral 
exploitation, and limestone quarrying—issues that are eroding Jaffna's 
environmental and social fabric. Their failure to act decisively suggests a 
troubling lack of political will or administrative capability.
Studies consistently demonstrate that Jaffna and the Tamil-majority 
regions of Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka face a growing environmental 
crisis. This crisis stems from the uncontrolled exploitation of natural 
resources, including sand smuggling, mineral extraction, and limestone 
quarrying. These practices pose a significant threat to the region's 
environmental integrity and long-term sustainability.
While the Mines and Minerals Act of 1992 provides a regulatory 
framework, its enforcement is crippled by political interference and 
a "sand mafia" empowered by relaxed licensing and environmental 
compliance. This has led to the depletion of Jaffna's crucial limestone 
aquifer, jeopardizing the region's long-term water security. A study by 
the University of Jaffna's agricultural department confirms this depletion, 
with data showing a concerning negative water balance.
Beyond depletion, the quality of both surface and groundwater is 
compromised. Saltwater intrusion contaminates drinking water and 
agricultural sources, while increased turbidity and sedimentation 
harm aquatic life and disrupt delicate ecosystems. The lack of proper 
Environmental Impact Mitigation (EIM) measures further compounds the 
damage.
Jaffna's future cannot be entrusted to theatrical politicians who prioritize 
stunts over substance. The region needs leaders who grasp the seriousness 
of the situation and are committed to addressing it through sound 
governance, not amateur dramatics. The exploitation of natural resources 
highlights a governance crisis that lays bare the failures of those in power.
It is time for the NPP to demonstrate that it is more than just a protest 
movement. As the ruling party, it carries the historic distinction of being 
the first Sinhala-led political party to gain significant support in the North 
and East, and technically, it has become the ruling party in every district 
in the region except Batticaloa. This unprecedented trust from a region 
that has traditionally aligned with Tamil nationalist politics highlights the 
hope and expectations placed upon the NPP to deliver meaningful change.</p>

The party now holds both the responsibility and the power to address the 
deep-rooted issues plaguing the region. The people of Jaffna deserve more 
than empty promises and performative politics. They deserve tangible, long-
term solutions that prioritize their welfare over short-term political gains and 
media spectacles.
If the NPP fails to rise to the occasion, it risks squandering the historic 
mandate it has received. Anything less than decisive, impactful action would 
not only be a missed opportunity but also a betrayal of the trust that the people 
of Jaffna have placed in their elected representatives. The time for rhetoric has 
passed; the time for effective governance is now.
