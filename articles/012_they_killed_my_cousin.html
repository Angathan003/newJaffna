y name is Selvanayagam Yoganathan, 
previously known as Pandiyan during 
my time with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE). I am closely related to Robert, 
a distinguished commander within the LTTE's 
Eastern Province, renowned for his strategic 
role in the Elephant Pass army camp assault. 
Robert, my cousin, is the son of my father's 
younger sister.
In his role with the LTTE, Robert served as the 
deputy military leader of the Eastern Province, 
acting as the second-in-command to Karuna 
Amman. When Karuna chose to part ways 
with the LTTE, citing the need to address the 
neglected issues of the Eastern regions, Robert 
aligned with him, prioritizing the welfare 
of the Eastern Province. However, seeking 
to avoid a fraternal conflict, he relocated to 
Colombo to escape the conflict triggered by 
the Vanni Tigers' aggressive incursion into the 
Eastern territories. 
While in Colombo, Robert was approached by 
military personnel. As a dedicated member of 
the LTTE, he sought to avoid any interactions 
with the army and decided to return to 
Batticaloa. Upon his return, he reached out to 
Ramanan and Keerthi, leaders of the LTTE's 
intelligence wing in Batticaloa, to secure 
assurances of safety. They promised him 
protection on the condition that he remain 
uninvolved in ongoing conflicts. Accompanied 
by Thurai, a relative and the then-head of the 
LTTE's political wing in the Batticaloa district 
during Karuna Amman’s leadership, Robert 
moved to Kollunulai, a small fishing village in 
the Eastern district, where he led a peaceful, 
ordinary life.
However, their peaceful existence was abruptly 
disrupted when they were summoned to meet 
Keerthi, the head of the LTTE's Batticaloa 
district intelligence wing, and they never 
returned.
Subsequently, I learned of the tragic fate that 
befell Robert and other prominent Eastern 
LTTE commanders such as Jimkely Thatha, 
Vasu, and 15 others. They were ruthlessly

burned to death by the Vanni Tigers at 
Panchimarathadi. This barbaric act was 
ordered by Ramesh, who, served as the LTTE's 
military head of Batticaloa and Ampara 
districts at the time. The irony lies in the fact 
that Ramesh was Robert's cousin.
Later, I discovered that they were burned to 
death by an LTTE guard named Raguvaran, 
who still resides and owns a bakery in 
Kottiyavalai. Initially, the LTTE leadership 
pinned the blame on Ramesh. However, as 
a member of the LTTE, I understood that 
Ramesh couldn't have acted alone. The 
command must have originated from higher 
echelons, likely stemming from Prabhakaran 
and transmitted through the LTTE's 
intelligence wing head, Pottu Amman.
Later, as the Eastern LTTE fighters rallied 
and struck back against the Vanni Tigers, 
they captured a Vanni combatant who had 
been a witness to the horrific events at 
Panchimarathadi. He revealed that Robert 
confronted his impending death with 
remarkable bravery, boldly asking Ramesh to 
shoot him in the chest so he could meet his 
end like a warrior. Robert even prophesized 
Ramesh's own destiny in a chilling 
forewarning, telling him, \,Jf;nfy;yhk; eP 
gjpy; nrhy;Ytha;" ("you will have to answer 
for this"). True to Robert's words, Ramesh met 
his demise at the hands of the Sri Lankan army, 
surrendering without resorting to cyanide like 
a coward. 
Witnessing this, I began to believe in karma.
name is Kanthasamy Ranjithamalar. 
My brothers, Prabha (also known by 
his nom de guerre, Lavamohan in the 
LTTE) and Thavarasa (known within 
the LTTE as Pikki), were drawn into the 
ranks of the LTTE at a tender age, fueled 
by a fervent yearning for liberation.
Following the schism orchestrated by 
Karuna Amman, my brothers tragically 
fell to the Vanni Tigers. One was cruelly 
snatched from our lives in Vellikantai, 
and the other suffered a similar fate in 
Pentukalcenai. Once part of a vibrant 
family of five siblings, I now mourn the 
loss of both my brothers. Their violent 
deaths have etched a permanent scar 
on my soul. At times, the wish that fate 
might have spared just one of them 
haunts me, longing for a chance to 
preserve some semblance of our family’s 
legacy. The agony of their absence is a 
relentless burden that shadows our daily 
lives.
In the wake of their demise, our family 
was thrust into overwhelming adversity. 
With our parents already passed, the 
mantle of responsibility descended upon 
me. To this day, haunting questions of 
justice and fairness gnaw at me—why 
were my brothers, barely more than 
children at 17 and 19, brutally ripped 
from our lives? The gaping void left by 
their untimely departure is a wound in 
my heart that time refuses to heal.
