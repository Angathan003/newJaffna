Black 
Cuckoo
R
avishaṅkar could not comprehend why 
white women tourists were falling over 
one another to kiss the outer wall around his 
house. It got a fresh coat of paint just three 
months ago. Now, he could count at least 
a hundred lipstick marks. Perhaps it could 
have had a certain kind of beauty had they 
been all of the same color. But the lipstick 
marks came in all colors, red, purple, green, 
black, and so on, making the wall look like an 
ugly pockmarked face of someone who was 
afflicted with the monkeypox. As if this were 
not enough, some even left little notes on cards 
or scraps of paper on top of the wall. When 
Ravishaṅkar quizzed his eighty-year-old father, 
he responded somewhat indifferently, “What 
can I do son? I have tried my best to chase the 
white people away. But when I doze off for a 
bit, they manage to do their dirty deed. Some 
even tried to enter the house. Your mother and 
I close the door and stay indoors. We were 
waiting for you to return. Cursed Colombo.” 
There was a tinge of irritation in his voice that 
their son was using him and the old woman as 
unpaid guards for the house.
Ravishaṅkar was the owner of seven or eight 
gas stations in London. As soon as he saw</p>

an advertisement on some website that in 
the Wellawatte area of the city of Colombo, 
house number 56 on the 42nd Lane was for 
sale, he snapped it up cheaply. Back then, it 
was a dilapidated house in ruins. He poured 
his London pounds to renovate the house to 
make it into a crystal palace. He had repaired 
the outer wall, whitewashed it, and installed 
a piece of marble in it with the word “Ravi 
Villa” embossed in gold lettering. Before he 
returned to London, he forced his parents, 
who were living a relaxed life in the village 
of Puḷiyaṅgūdal, to move to the new house 
in Wellawatte. But when he returned three 
months later, he was confronted with this 
situation.
Had he realized that all these kisses and notes 
were intended for the name that was printed 
in yellow on a small piece of wood shaped 
like a black cuckoo hanging on the same wall 
ninety odd years ago, the wall that bore the 
name Ravi Villa now, things could have been 
different. His fantastic business brain would 
have sold the house at ten times the purchase 
price. This was the house that a great poet had 
rented for two years in 1929. The poet, who at 
twenty had dazzled the world with a collection 
of poetry titled ‘Twenty Love Poems and a 
Song of Despair,’ was twenty-five when he 
moved into this house. He was an official 
at the Chilean consulate. He wrote much of 
his celebrated book of poetry, ‘Residencia 
en la tierra,’ in the west room of this house, 
sitting in front of the windows that looked out 
towards the Laccadive Sea.
It was the black cuckoo hanging at the 
entrance that helped Sampaṅki identify 
the house at first. Her father Muththān had 
repeated everything about this house many 
times over. She should go there at the first 
light of dawn. How should she enter the yard? 
If she would noiselessly open the iron grill 
gate next to the hanging black cuckoo to enter 
the yard, she would see a footpath to the left 
of the house in the midst of croton bushes. If 
she walked along that path, she would come 
to the wooden toilet which was set apart some 
distance from the house. There, she should 
remove the iron bucket fitted under the hole 
in the toilet floor and empty it into the sea a 
short distance away. She should then rinse 
the bucket in the sea and put the bucket back 
into its slot in the toilet. She should do all this 
with lightning speed. There was a tin can next 
to the toilet door. Sometimes, there would 
be some coins left inside the can as the fee. 
Sampaṅki should carefully secure the coins 
within a knot in her sāri without losing them.
After all, when Sampaṅki was a little girl, she 
did accompany her mother Kandhammā when 
she went out to work. Yet, Muththān kept 
repeating his instructions.
“You must not forget any of these instructions. 
Most importantly, if you happen to see the 
white master of that house, you must greet him 
by saying, ‘Good morning;’ Sampaṅki, let’s 
hear you say it out loud: “Good morning.”</p>

Sampaṅki just nodded her head. She hardly 
opened her mouth to speak.
In course of time, Sampaṅki’s parents had 
come to realize that she was born with a 
mental handicap. They had hoped that it was 
because of a divine curse and that it would 
be lifted someday. Kandhammā kept on 
lamenting to the gods. Cholera took away the 
three children that followed Sampaṅki even 
before they were weaned. Kandhammā had 
vowed that if her only remaining child got her 
intellect straightened out, she would throw 
salt and pepper as offering to the Poṉṉiammaṉ 
temple. She bought a small silver tongue from 
Kochikadē St. Anthony’s shrine and left it as 
an offering by the shrine’s doorstep. She went 
into the Dutch canal by herself to pluck white 
lotus flowers and left them in front of the 
Mahābōdhi vihāra as her offering.
Sampaṅki’s handicap remained through all 
of these seventeen years. Even worse, as she 
grew older, she became increasingly forgetful. 
She even forgot important matters quickly. 
Her neighbors teasingly called her a ‘skink’ 
because of the seemingly forgetful nature 
of that lizard-like animal. The deficiencies 
meant that finding a husband for her was being 
delayed, too. Muththān’s buddy Kēsavayyā 
had been dropping hints to Muththān that he 
would be interested in marrying Sampaṅki. 
But Muththān did not want to give away his 
daughter to that widower and drunkard. Her 
mother, who was beseeching and lamenting to 
gods asking them to cure Sampaṅki had now 
graduated to questioning and cursing the gods. 
If there was a human sound emanating from 
their hut, it was surely Kandhammā cursing 
the gods out.
Sampaṅki did not like to talk to anyone. She 
preferred solitude. She did not care at all 
that a husband had not been found for her. 
Of all the things in this world, she loved the 
sea. When she was small, she had heard her 
grandmother say, “I saw the sea for the first 
time when I boarded the ship to Ceylon.” She 
had worried about how it was possible for a 
place without the sea to exist. Most of her time 
was spent alone on the seashore. There was 
a large ship that had beached. They say that 
it was a Dutch warship from a hundred years 
prior. Birds descend on that ship in a myriad 
of configurations: helixes, towers, and flowers 
in blossom. When they fly off again, they form 
yet another magical arrangement. Once she 
even saw a group of black birds rising off the 
ship in the shape of an elephant. She never 
tired of watching those avian illusions, eyes 
wide with wonder.
Sampaṅki always walked slowly. When she 
sat down to eat, it would take her an hour to 
consume a coconut shell worth of porridge, 
constantly blowing on it to cool it down. She 
did everything in slow motion. She had only 
one sāri. Someone had given that tattered 
red sāri with a golden border as wages to 
Kandhammā. She spent an hour every day 
washing that sāri with neem seed powder. 
She would spread it out on the sand to dry 
and walk around it to make sure that she 
had washed it properly. Even when she was 
washing a pot, she would rub it with wood 
ash until it shone. She would hold it up at eye 
level to admire her handiwork. Even though 
she was slow, she was thorough and correct in 
everything she did.
Their seaside hut was part of a government 
colony at Bambalawatte for sanitary workers. 
There were around twenty huts on the bank of 
the Dutch canal where it merged with the sea. 
When the tin roof became unbearably hot in 
the sun, the ground beneath it was soggy and 
muddy. During the rainy season, the Dutch 
canal would overflow and flood the huts. The 
workers in this little colony were responsible 
for removing the toilet waste from all the 
houses within a five-mile radius. They swept 
the streets. They removed pets when they</p>

died. Men and married women went to work. 
Unmarried women were never sent out to 
work. But Sampaṅki was compelled to go to 
the black cuckoo house.
On Kēsavayyā’s insistence, Muththān had a 
little too much to drink in Company Roads, 
formerly known as Slave Island. By midday, 
he had fallen ill. The drink called kaṭṭukkampi 
or tie wire was just pure distilled alcohol. 
Kēsavayyā’s habit was to squeeze lemon juice 
into it. Something must have gone wrong 
with the distilled alcohol. Muththān collapsed 
onto the sand. His blood was escaping his 
body through his mouth and stomach like rice 
water. He could not even stand up straight. 
In the mornings, he needed to empty the 
toilet-bucket waste from six houses, collect 
the waste from them into a tin bucket, carry 
it on his head, and empty it into the sea. His 
customers would not tolerate even a day’s 
absence. They would immediately find a 
replacement worker. It was in this backdrop 
that they planned for Kandhammā to go to the 
five houses in Colpetty. She must finish work 
in these five houses and then rush off to the 
houses in Cinnamon Gardens that were her 
regular customers. Sampaṅki would therefore 
need to go to the only remaining customer in 
the opposite direction, in Wellawatte. It was a 
fact that this family could not afford to forgo 
the income of even half a cent.
The family decided to keep it a secret that 
Sampaṅki had to go out to work. There would 
be talk and ridicule from the neighbors if they 
learned that an unmarried woman was sent 
out to work. Finding her a husband would 
become even more difficult. That night, 
Sampaṅki could barely sleep, worrying about</p>

not forgetting any of the instructions that her 
father kept repeating.
Early next morning, before it was light, 
Sampaṅki covertly left the colony and 
walked slowly along the seashore towards the 
specified landmarks. She usually walked on 
the wet sand, planting each step firmly and 
fiddling with the sand with each step. She 
was tall and slim. There was not an ounce of 
excess fat in her body. She had worn her long 
hair into a bun on the top of her head, making 
her look even taller. She had copper bangles in 
each arm. Above the thick lips that concealed 
her beautiful buck teeth on either side of 
her mouth, her red glass nose studs on each 
nostril shone like tiny flames. Kandhammā 
never tired of asserting that Sampaṅki was the 
prettiest woman in the whole colony and the 
one with the fairest skin. She said, “When she 
eats black plums, your eyes can see the black 
juice going down her throat.”
The black cuckoo house was not far from 
Sampaṅki’s colony. If one headed southward 
along the seashore from Bambalawatte, 
they could arrive within fifteen minutes. But 
Sampaṅki’s slow gait required thirty minutes. 
She walked with hesitation. Muththān had 
said, “There is a lazy dog in that house 
Sampaṅki. You are scared of even cats, 
Sampaṅki. That dog will not even sniff you. 
It will be dozing off by the entrance.” But 
anxiety still lurked in a corner of Sampaṅki’s 
mind.
She walked slowly, murmuring the directions 
that Muththān had drummed into her head. 
As she passed the Darmashānthi vihāra, there 
was the coco de mer tree. As Sampaṅki took 
the sand road opposite that tree, heading 
eastwards, dawn was complete. Amidst the 
wild growth of shrubbery and bushes, stood 
the new, tall, white house. The black cuckoo 
was hanging to the right of the iron grill gate 
on the outer wall. Sampaṅki hesitated for a 
few minutes, staring at the black cuckoo. The 
house lay still. She peeked through the iron 
grill gate. Just as Muththān had said, the lazy 
dog was curled up by the front entrance.
Sampaṅki pushed the iron grill gate gently and 
it opened noiselessly. She had now forgotten 
whether Muththān had told her to turn left 
or right. As she crossed the gate and stepped 
into the yard, the dog raised its head, and she 
turned hers. On the left, between the newly 
planted croton plants, the footpath was visible. 
She walked along the footpath. She circled the 
house and walked towards the outdoor toilet 
without making a sound. The toilet door was 
open. A pretty white woman was squatting on 
the toilet, stark naked.
Sampaṅki froze. She had no idea what she 
should do next. She could do nothing but 
lower her eyes. Her legs froze. The white 
woman squatted there staring at Sampaṅki 
with her blue eyes. Her hand was moving 
behind her. Suddenly, she jumped up, 
screamed, and ran towards the house, still 
naked.
Sampaṅki felt that she was really going to 
faint. The white woman’s urine bubbled up 
around the toilet bowl. The bucket was full 
of excrement and rags. Just as Muththān had 
said, the lid for the bucket was hanging from 
the outer wall of the toilet. She closed the 
bucket lid tightly, lifted the bucket onto her 
head and started walking towards the seashore. 
As she walked, she picked up a tiny acorn-like 
withered baby coconut from the ground with 
her toes, lifted her foot up to her left hand so 
that she could grasp the baby coconut with it. 
She squatted at the water’s edge and emptied 
the bucket into the sea. Then she waded into 
the water up to her knee and scrubbed the 
bucket clean with the dried baby coconut and 
rinsed it. She was afraid to go back to the 
house. She imagined the naked white woman 
to be a mōhiṉi ghost. With her eyes lowered,</p>

she walked back to the house and inserted the 
bucket into its slot. Only then did she notice 
the small tin can by the toilet door. She had 
forgotten all about it. She lifted it up. It was 
empty.
Sampaṅki returned to Bambalawatte. She 
took a long relaxing bath in the sea and was 
walking back to the hut in a wet sāri when 
she noticed Kandhammā returning after work, 
carrying a cassava tuber in her hand. In that 
hut, they did not have the habit of making 
breakfast. That day, the cassava would be the 
lunch for the mother and daughter, and a bit 
of salted porridge for the unwell Muththān. 
“Was there money in the tin can?” asked 
Kandhammā. Sampaṅki shook her head. When 
Kandhammā repeated, “Remember well! Was 
there money in the can?” Sampaṅki shook her 
head again.
When Sampaṅki went to the black cuckoo 
house on the third day, a young woman with 
East Asian features sat on the steps smoking 
a cigar. She stared intently at Sampaṅki. 
She was wearing a white full-sleeved shirt 
and a sarong that looked like a rainbow. 
When Sampaṅki went around to the back 
of the house with her eyes cast downwards, 
she could hear the rustling of leaves. When 
Sampaṅki proceeded to the toilet without 
turning her head, the rustling stopped. When 
she closed the toilet bucket, that woman took a 
copper coin and tossed on the ground in front 
of Sampaṅki who picked it up and tied into a 
knot on her sāri, lifted the bucket to her head 
and started walking. When Sampaṅki went 
to the black cuckoo house the next day, that 
woman was no longer there.
In the following days, Sampaṅki saw several 
different types of women at the black cuckoo 
house. One day, as Sampaṅki entered, a white 
woman, a Malay woman, and a Ceylonese 
woman emerged from the house giggling, with 
drunkenness in their eyes, and started walking 
towards the beach. When Sampaṅki went to 
empty the toilet bucket they were standing on 
one leg, facing eastwards, with their hands 
brought together above their heads in worship.
On the ninth day, when Sampaṅki went to 
the black cuckoo house, the front window 
was open. Inside, a young white man kept</p>

staring at her with wide eyes. Sampaṅki 
lowered her eyes and walked towards the 
toilet. When she returned with the toilet bucket 
on her head, he was sitting at the doorstep 
with a book in his hand. He was handsome 
and well-built, wearing only short pants. 
When Sampaṅki returned with the empty 
bucket, he stood holding the iron grill gate, 
looking at Sampaṅki with a smile. When 
Sampaṅki approached, he touched the piece 
of wood in the shape of a black cuckoo and 
said something. Sampaṅki was stunned. Not 
knowing what she should do, she stood rooted 
to the spot. She had completely forgotten 
that Muththān repeatedly said, “If you see 
the master of the house, you must say ‘Good 
morning.’” The white man started walking 
towards the sea, singing aloud.
The next day, when Sampaṅki went to 
the black cuckoo house, the white man 
was standing by the back entrance in semi 
darkness. He was wearing a gown that reached 
down to his knees, and a mischievous smile. 
There was a strange sound coming from 
within his gown. She had never heard such a 
sound before. When she approached the toilet, 
she noticed that the tin can was full of coins. 
She secured all the coins into a knot on her 
sāri. He stood there watching her until she left 
with the toilet bucket. When Sampaṅki laid all 
the coins on the mat before Muththān, he said, 
“White people are like this. If they like our 
work, they reward us well.”
The next day, he was waiting at the same 
place when Sampaṅki showed up. When she 
approached the toilet door, she saw that there 
were some glass bangles in the tin can. She 
kneeled on the ground and put the bangles on 
both hands. Then, she lifted the toilet bucket 
and left without looking up.
The next day again, he was waiting by the 
back entrance. As she walked towards the 
toilet, he said, softly, “Hey, hey.” When 
Sampaṅki raised her eyes to look at him, he 
put his right hand forward. He had a new 
green sāri in his hand. He smiled and signaled 
with the sāri for her to come near him. Her 
feet refused to move. He left the sāri at the 
doorstep and went into the house. Sampaṅki 
walked slowly with her eyes cast downwards 
and took the sāri. When she showed it to 
Kandhammā, she said, “Keep it safely. You 
can wear it for your wedding.”
The next day when she went to the black 
cuckoo house, her heart was overflowing with 
gratitude. As she walked towards the toilet, 
she heard leaves rustle behind her. When she 
turned, the young man was standing very close 
to her. He looked into her eyes, and gently 
grabbed her right wrist. Sampaṅki felt that her 
blood dried and turned into water. She tried 
to extricate herself from his grasp. Now, as 
his grip tightened, droplets of tears formed in 
her eyes and fell on her cheeks. He dragged 
her into the house through the open back 
entrance. Her legs felt like wooden blocks. He 
carried her like a doll. She curled her mouth 
and sobbed silently. He now lifted her with his 
strong arms and laid her down in the middle 
of the rope bed. Sampaṅki was sure that he 
was going to kill her. Afraid to face death, she 
shut her eyes tightly. She then felt her golden-
bordered sāri being whipped away from her 
body. Her hands instinctively tried to cover her 
nakedness.
He knocked her hands away roughly. When 
he collapsed on top of her, Sampaṅki felt as 
if death itself was descending on her. She 
remembered the mōhiṉi ghost she met on her 
first day at this house. The thought of whether 
the ghost had now taken male form now 
pervaded her entire being and terrorized her. 
The weight of his body suffocated her. The hot 
breath that hissed out of his nostrils burned her 
skin. She shook, imagining that the ghost had</p>

opened its fiery eyes.
His one hand grabbed her hair that was 
plaited into a bun on the top of her head, 
while the other tried to force her eyelids 
open. She resolved not to look into the eyes 
of death under any circumstances and shut 
her eyes tightly. He stood up from her and 
whistled softly. A return whistle came from 
somewhere. Something moved from the 
base of her stomach towards her eyes, while 
making a noise. As Sampaṅki thought that her 
life force was leaving her body via her eyes, 
they opened by themselves. A small animal 
was sniffing her face. He commanded it by 
shouting, “Kiria, Kiria,” and the mongoose 
jumped to the part of her body he pointed to. 
Terrified, Sampaṅki lay still like a corpse. 
Thereafter, she could not close her eyes.
When Kandhammā returned from work, 
Muththān was sitting outside the hut. He 
looked at Kandhammā and turned his head 
towards the wood-fired stove inside. There, 
Sampaṅki lay curled up, with her head among 
the ashes. Shocked, Kandhammā ran inside 
and kneeled beside her daughter and turned 
her face. Sampaṅki’s eyes were wide open. 
“It hurts, āyi,” Sampaṅki moaned. When 
Kandhammā asked, “Where does it hurt?” 
she pointed to her lower belly. With shaking 
hands, Kandhammā lifted Sampaṅki’s sāri and 
saw that her vagina was bleeding.
At midday the next day, Muththān came out 
of the hut when he heard someone call him 
aloud, “Muththān,... Muththān.” Bhrampy, 
who was also known as ‘kaḷu mahaththayā,’ 
because of his dark complexion and long 
limbs, was standing outside. He did the 
cooking and chores at the black cuckoo house 
from midday till evening. He was the one who 
had come earlier to Bambalawatte to talk to 
Muththān and employ him at the black cuckoo 
house.
“Muththān, why didn’t anyone come to 
empty the toilet bucket in the morning? Am I 
supposed to empty it myself?”
“I am not well, kaḷu mahaththayā… it was just 
yesterday that I was finally able to stand up 
from the mat and walk about…”
“The master said a girl had been coming to 
work during the past few days…”
“Her wedding has been fixed for tomorrow 
kaḷu mahaththayā. Our Kēsavayyā has taken 
pity on our mentally handicapped daughter 
and is going to marry her.”
After Bhrampy went back, Kandhammā 
came out of the hut and sat down on the 
sand. Muththān sat down in front of her. 
Kandhammā brought her face close to his and 
said in a low voice:
“Kēsavayyā will buy new clothes for the 
wedding, won’t he? Even if he doesn’t, 
Sampaṅki has a new sāri.”
“The sāri that the paṟaṅgi gave her? Burn it! 
How much would she suffer each time she 
sees that sāri!”
Kandhammā was quiet for a while. She turned 
her head to the left to look at the hut. Then she 
turned her head to the right to look at the sea, 
and said, “The merciful God has blessed my 
daughter with forgetfulness. She will forget 
everything soon. In course of time, everyone 
will have forgotten everything.”
But the white poet in the black cuckoo house 
did not forget it. In the four-hundred-page 
autobiography titled ‘Memoirs, by Pablo 
Neruda,” published exactly forty-three years 
after he left Sri Lanka with his pet mongoose 
Kiria, he had allocated one page for Sampaṅki.</p>
