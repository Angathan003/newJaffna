W
hat turns a young man, 
who leaves home to fight 
legitimate grievances in his 
community and nurtures big 
dreams on behalf of his people, 
into a dedicated killer who sees 
violence as the answer to every 
problem?
The Indian journalist, M.R. 
Narayan Swamy, who has 
followed the story of The 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE), sets out to answer this 
question in his timely and well-
researched book The Rout of Prabhakaran.
As the chief negotiator in the Sri Lankan peace 
process, I asked myself the same question 
numerous times: How, as Swamy puts it, did 
“guns become the answer to overcome each 
and every obstacle in the chessboard of Tamil 
Eelam” in Velupillai Prabhakaran’s mind?
Prabhakaran was the main strength, as well 
as the principle weakness, of the LTTE. He 
created one of the most effective guerrilla 
forces in the world and turned 
the somewhat sleepy and 
unsexy Tamil struggle into 
one of the epic wars at the 
turn of the 20th century. No 
movement in human history 
has mobilised the suicide 
weapon in such a deadly 
fashion — killing a former 
prime minister of India, and 
numerous Sri Lankan leaders.
It all ended in an orgy of 
violence orchestrated by the 
Sri Lankan army in May 2009, 
with the death of every LTTE leader who 
had not defected to the army years earlier. 
Prabhakaran and his entire family were 
killed. His 12-year-old son Balachandran was 
murdered in a blatant war crime even after 
being taken into custody by the army.
A paradox
Though he was fighting for Tamils, 
paradoxically, Prabhakaran also became 
the big killer of Tamils. He annihilated

leader Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja 
(Mahattaya), LTTE chief 
Prabhakaran, his trusted 
bodyguard Thiyagu, 
and an Indian Army 
officer during the Indian 
Peacekeeping Force 
(IPKF) era. Ironically, 
Mahattaya was later 
executed by the LTTE 
on Prabhakaran’s orders 
as an alleged RAW spy, 
while Thiyagu and a 
female LTTE fighter 
were executed by the 
LTTE after she became 
pregnant with his child.</p>

all competing Tamil militant groups. He 
hunted down Sri Sabaratnam of the Tamil 
Eelam Liberation Organisation in Jaffna. His 
comrade-in-arms Mahattaya was shot as an 
Indian spy in the Vanni. The historic Tamil 
leader Amirthalingam was murdered in 
Colombo. My friend Neelan Thiruchelvam 
was blown up by a suicide cadre in Colombo, 
even as he was headed for Harvard. The LTTE 
later told me it was because he had refused to 
abandon the process of proposed changes to 
the constitution. Foreign Minister Lakshman 
Kadirgamar was shot in 2005 in what today 
can best be seen as the beginning of the end 
for Prabhakaran.
How does one explain this turn in 
Prabhakaran? Two explanations stand out 
in Swamy’s telling. Prabhakaran had a very 
narrow horizon; he did not understand 
geopolitics or the workings of the big 
neighbour, India. He hardly ventured to 
the south of Sri Lanka and had interacted 
very little with Sinhalese or Muslims. His 
perspective was that of the village. How 
else can you explain the stupidity of killing 
Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, who was India’s prime 
minister from 1984 to 1989, at a time when 
India was the main source of support for his 
struggle? Would a successful rebel movement 
in Mexico attempt to murder President 
Trump?
The LTTE was also primarily a military 
movement. It did not mainly involve itself 
in mass work, political mobilisation, or 
humanitarian efforts. Did the early spectacular 
military success against the Indian army, 
later over-running the Elephant Pass, nearly 
wiping off the Palaly air base and attacking 
Colombo airport in an extraordinary raid with 
devastating effects on the Sri Lankan economy 
create a certain arrogance?
There is a history of guerrilla fighters turning 
themselves into successful political leaders, 
particularly when they understood the need 
for a broad front, and, even more importantly, 
that the gun was only a supplementary vehicle 
to the political struggle. Yoweri Museveni in 
Uganda and Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia, the 
Chinese and Vietnamese Communists won 
military triumphs against all odds, but at the 
end their victories were political.
Michael Collins, the founding father of 
Ireland, was an extraordinary assassin of the 
British, but he knew that the British empire 
could not be brought down with guns alone.
An end foretold
Was the end preordained then for 
Prabhakaran? Swamy thinks so. But he doesn’t 
try to explain why the LTTE entered into the</p>

peace process, not out of weakness, but at the 
peak of its power in 2002. Why negotiate when 
you are strong?
I met Prabhakaran many times and saw softer 
aspects to the man. He was a film enthusiast 
and a dedicated cook. He adored his children 
and sent me to Ireland to secure a place at 
Dublin University for his beloved daughter 
Duwaraka. She was accepted, only to be caught 
up in her father’s renewed war and perish with 
her family in 2009.
Prabhakaran’s friend and partner Anton 
Balasingham was the good influence on him, 
always offering sound and critical advice. It 
was after Bala died in 2006, that Thambi or 
younger brother as Bala called him, started 
making many mistakes.
He strongly advised against the Tamil 
boycott of the 2005 election which brought 
Mahinda Rajapaksa to power. The Sri 
Lankan government also made a mistake by 
restricting access of foreigners to Prabhakaran. 
International diplomats like me had tried to 
guide him towards peace.
At the end, it all led to his last apocalyptic 
decision to fight to the last day — and the last 
Tamil. Through Kumaran Pathmanathan, KP, 
the LTTE ‘foreign minister’, we offered to bring 
out all the combatants and civilians from the 
war zone. When KP went to finalise the deal, 
Prabhakaran refused. The rest is history.
Swamy does not explain all aspects of the Sri 
Lankan crisis. The Sinhala war crimes are not 
centre stage; nor the catastrophic decisions 
of so many Colombo leaders who created a 
divided rather than united land. But Swamy 
masterly sums up the extraordinary life and 
legacy of Prabhakaran.
The reviewer was chief peace 
negotiator between the LTTE and the 
Sri Lankan government.
