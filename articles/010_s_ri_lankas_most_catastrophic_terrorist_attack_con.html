S
ri Lanka’s most catastrophic terrorist 
attack continues to be exploited for 
personal and political gains. Sri Lanka will 
mark the sixth anniversary of the Easter 
Sunday massacre on April 21, 2025. Sri 
Lanka’s most powerful religious leader 
Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has issued an 
ultimatum to the incumbent government to 
deliver justice for the victims of the Easter 
Sunday attack. If not, the Cardinal threatens 
to stage mass protests that will compromise 
social, political and economic stability.
Four successive Sri Lankan leaders and 
their governments could not convince 
the Cardinal of the truth. Relentless in 
his campaign, his influence contributed 
appreciably to ousting presidents Maithripala 
Sirisena, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, and Ranil 
Wickramasinghe. Will manipulation of 
the facts of the Easter Sunday massacre 
destabilise the current government too?
Today, the Cardinal is on a collision course 
with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. 
If President Dissanayake too fails to convince 
the leader of the Catholic community of the 
truth, he will be the fourth Sri Lankan leader 
to face the wrath of the Cardinal. Both the 
domestic and foreign investigations have 
concluded that the attack was staged by 
Muslim religious extremists. Their findings 
are consistent with the global trend where 
over 90% of the acts of terrorism are staged 
by Muslim religious extremists. There is 
nothing wrong with Islam but with Muslims 
who misinterpret their faith for political and 
personal gain. In Sri Lanka, it is time for the 
people to understand the party politics and 
the politicians that have gravely damaged 
Sri Lanka’s unity and harmony. It is time to 
stop playing dirty politics and disclose to the 
nation,  the key findings of the Easter Sunday 
massacre.
Easter Attack Investigations
In a democracy, if justice for the Easter 
Sunday victims is to be delivered, it should be 
based on evidence and not conspiracy. After 
extensive investigations and research, I wrote, 
“Sri Lanka’s Easter Sunday Massacre - Lessons 
to be Learnt” to set the record straight. Having 
interviewed the leadership of the Islamic 
State Sri Lanka Branch, I also interviewed 
Abdul Kader Fatima Hadiya, the widow of 
Mohammed Hashim Mohammed Zahran. 
I also interviewed Zahran’s deputy and his 
successor Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed 
Naufer and its military wing leader Hayatu 
Mohamed Ahmed Milhan. Both remain 
in custody. They have all admitted to the 
attack and I have documented in detail what 
they have said to me and to both the Sri 
Lankan and foreign investigators. There is no 
inconsistency in the findings by the Sri Lankan 
and foreign investigators. The disparity lies in 
how certain politicians have misinterpreted 
and misrepresented the facts surrounding 
the Easter attack. Additionally, a group of 
YouTubers, clergymen, and NGO activists 
have propagated distorted narratives and 
unfounded theories. The following excerpts 
from my book respond to these false claims 
and aim to challenge the narratives put forth 
by conspiracy theorists.
The Easter attack is one of the most 
thoroughly investigated terrorist attacks in 
the world. After the 9/11 attack by Al Qaeda 
and the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas 
and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Sri Lanka’s 
Easter Sunday attack by the Islamic State is the 
world’s third worst terrorist attack. The world 
witnessed savagery because the perpetrators 
deliberately butchered civilians. The attackers 
distorted Islam, invoked Allah, and killed, 
maimed and injured innocent civilians.</p>

Successive Sri Lankan governments have 
established fact-finding bodies to better 
understand the attack. Accordingly, special 
committees and boards have been appointed 
by the government to investigate and report 
on matters relevant to the Easter attack. Both 
local and foreign government authorities 
investigated and  reported their findings.
Local mechanisms
1. Report of the Special Three-Member 
Inquiry Panel on the Easter Sunday Attacks 
(June 10, 2019)
2. Report of the Parliamentary Select 
Committee on the Easter Sunday Attacks 
(October 23, 2019)
3. Report of the Parliamentary Sectoral 
Oversight Committee on National Security 
(February 19, 2020)
4. Report of the Presidential Special Commiss-
ion of Inquiry into the Easter Sunday 
Bombings, Volume 1 (January 31, 2021)
5. Report of the Cabinet Ministerial 
Sub-Committee appointed on the 
implementation of the recommendations 
of the Presidential Commission on the 
Easter Sunday Attacks and the Oversight 
Committee on National Security (April 05, 
2021)
6. Report of the Committee to investigate the 
facts of the program broadcast on Channel 
4 regarding the Easter Sunday bombings 
(June 25, 2024)
7. Report of the Committee of Inquiry 
appointed under the chairmanship of 
retired Judge A.N.J. Alwis on Intelligence 
Coordination and Investigations into the 
Easter Sunday Bombings (September 14, 
2024)
In addition, law enforcement authorities 
notably the Police conducted investigations. 
The Counter-Terrorism and Investigation 
Division and the Criminal Investigation 
Department arrested about a hundred 
individuals and initiated legal proceedings.
Furthermore, on January 12, 2023, a seven-
judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered 
a landmark judgment concerning the Easter 
Sunday attacks. These fundamental rights 
cases were filed to examine how various 
public officials fulfilled their duties before 
and during the bombings on April 21, 2019. 
Those found responsible included Maithripala 
Sirisena (then President), Hemasiri Fernando 
(Secretary to the Ministry of Defence), Pujith 
Jayasundara (Inspector General of Police), 
Sisira Mendis (Chief of National Intelligence), 
and Nilantha Jayawardena (Director, State 
Intelligence Service), all of whom were ordered 
to pay compensation.
However, Muslim politicians who ignored 
the growing threat of radicalisation, and 
religious leaders who failed to safeguard the 
sanctity of religious spaces, have yet to be held 
accountable.
Foreign investigations
The Sri Lanka Police launched a 
comprehensive investigation into the 
Easter Sunday bombings. The Criminal 
Investigation Department expanded this into 
an international investigation to identify all 
perpetrators involved. Accordingly, foreign 
authorities including Scotland Yard, Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian 
Federal Police (AFP), India’s National 
Investigation Agency (NIA), Maldives Police 
Service, and Interpol have cooperated and 
assisted the Sri Lanka Police.</p>

Additionally, individual foreign countries 
have conducted independent investigations, 
published certain reports, filed charges, and 
pursued legal action.
1. United States of America
At the invitation of and with the permission 
from the Sri Lankan government, a team of 
FBI officials visited Sri Lanka in April 2019. 
The team included technical and forensic 
analysts with specialized equipment. Following 
investigations conducted jointly by the United 
States FBI and Sri Lanka, with assistance from 
the Attorney General's Department of Sri 
Lanka, the United States Federal Court in Los 
Angeles has indicted the following suspects, 
who are currently in custody in Sri Lanka, for 
nine crimes under United States law (including 
conspiracy, aiding, abetting, training, and 
providing assistance) in the attacks targeting 
tourist hotels that killed five American citizens 
and other foreigners:
i. Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed Naufer
ii. Mohammed Anwar Mohammed Rizkan
iii. Hayatu Mohamed Ahmed Milhan
Additionally, as a result of judicial proceedings 
connected to the Easter Sunday bombings 
investigation, on October 9, 2020, the US 
Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions 
on Lukman Talib, an Australian resident of 
Sri Lanka, and his company, Talib and Sons, 
through Executive Order (EO) 13224, for 
providing support to the terrorist organization 
Al Qaeda. This company, based in Melbourne, 
Australia, has been proven to have provided 
support to terrorist organizations including 
Al Qaeda using wealth earned under the guise 
of conducting gem businesses in Sri Lanka, 
Brazil, Colombia, Tanzania, Turkey, and the 
Gulf region.
2. Australia
The Australian government has taken legal 
action against three Australians of Sri Lankan 
origin who had links to the Easter attackers 
and confiscated their assets. Australian 
investigative services have provided assistance 
to Sri Lankan authorities. Under Operation 
Geldrop, 15 investigators arrived in the 
country in April and May 2019, conducted 
joint investigations with the Sri Lanka Police, 
and submitted their final reports.
M. R. M. Thaslim was 
shot by Milhan, the 
head of the Islamic State 
military wing, after he 
assisted the police and 
preempted an islandwide 
attack in Sri Lanka</p>

3. Maldives
Maldivian nationals with links to the Easter 
attackers have been identified during initial 
investigations. The Jamaat-e-Islami cell 
received from Maldives Islamic State cell to 
buy a lathe machine to manufacture weapons. 
It is the same cell that vandalised Buddhist, 
Christian, and Hindu images, attempted 
to assassinate M.R.M. Thaslim, a patriotic 
Muslim who assisted the police, and leased 
the property in Vanathavillu where Zahran 
established his weapons manufacturing and 
training base. Legal action is likely to be 
taken against these individuals following 
joint investigations by Maldivian intelligence 
officers and investigators.
What is the truth?
All local and international investigations have 
clearly established that the Easter Sunday 
attack was carried out by the Sri Lankan 
branch of the Islamic State. The groups aligned 
with the Islamic State included Jamaat-e-
Islami and Salafi-Wahhabi factions. Notably, 
no local or traditional Muslim groups joined 
Zahran, who lived in a segregated Muslim 
enclave. There was no integration—only 
isolation. The attack could have been both 
prevented and preempted. However, due to 
critical weaknesses in the state's national 
security apparatus, the terrorists succeeded.
Such a horrific attack in an island nation like 
Sri Lanka shocked and angered the general 
public. Despite facts confirmed by numerous 
local and international investigations, various 
conspiracy theories have been promoted. The 
findings have been politicized and the facts 
have been suppressed, either intentionally or 
unintentionally.
It appears that baseless or weakly substantiated 
conspiracy theories have gained popularity. 
Unfortunately, 53% of Sri Lankans believe 
local political forces were involved in the 
Easter Sunday attacks carried out in 2019, 
according to a survey commissioned in 
October by Syndicated Surveys, a survey 
instrument by Verité Research, a credible think 
tank led by Nishan de Mel. Only 8% believed 
that it was carried out without the involvement 
of local political forces. A high percentage, 
39%, said they have no opinion or refused to 
comment. The findings demonstrated that 
Sri Lanka has no capable public information 
plan, approach, and strategy to educate its own 
citizenry. Another aspect was that most of the 
Easter Sunday attack fact-finding reports are 
in English. Today, a majority of Sri Lankans 
cannot read, write, or speak in English.
A far-reaching government should develop 
an effective public communications system to 
debunk misinformation and disinformation. 
Otherwise, if fake news dominates the 
information space, the next generation of 
Sri Lankans will be driven by false narratives 
and conspiracy theories. One narrative that 
gained traction and was debunked pertained 
to Sara Jasmine. Anti-Indian Sri Lankan 
Muslim politicians promoted the conspiracy 
theory that India’s foreign intelligence service 
was behind the Easter Sunday attack and the 
Research and Analysis Wing  recruited as an 
agent Sarah Jasmine, a convert to Islam.
Was Indian intelligence behind the 
attack?
While Sarah Jasmine committed suicide in the 
Saindamarudu explosion, a false narrative was 
promoted that she fled to India. Samples for 
DNA testing were taken on three occasions 
regarding the individuals who died in the 
bomb blast at the Saindamarudu house on 
April 26, 2019.</p>

Forensic specialist Dr. Ruweera Nadira conducted 
tests at the Ampara General Hospital and obtained 
the first 26 DNA samples on April 28-29, 2019. The 
bodies were cremated on May 2, 2019. The DNA 
samples were handed over to the Government 
Analyst's Department on May 8, 2019.
Due to the deterioration of 11 of the 26 samples, 
those bodies were recovered on June 7, 2019, on court 
orders, and 11 new samples were handed over to the 
Government Analyst's Department.
Sarah Jasmine's mother's blood samples were also sent 
to the forensic scientist to test against the body parts.
The Government Analyst's reports regarding the DNA 
Islamic State acknowledged its Sri Lanka branch leader Zahran Hashim 
as being responsible for the Easter Sunday attack
samples were received on September 
9, 2019, November 15, 2019, and 
March 3, 2021. However, there was 
no match with the DNA of Sarah 
Jasmine's mother.
Against this backdrop, various 
opinions created a social debate 
on this issue. The main reason 
was that a personal informant 
of Chief Inspector Arjun Mahin 
Kanda, an investigating officer of 
the Presidential Commission of 
Inquiry, provided information to the 
Commission, and accordingly, two 
eyewitnesses presented evidence that 
Sarah Jasmine had fled to India.
Based on that evidence, Police 
Inspector Nagur Thambi Abubakkar, 
attached to the Transport Division 
of the Ampara Police Division, was 
arrested by the Colombo Crimes 
Division on July 11, 2020, on 
suspicion of having helped Sarah 
Jasmine escape. Subsequently, a case 
was filed against him in the High 
Court.
The CID conducted further 
investigations to determine 
whether Sarah Jasmine was living 
in Sri Lanka or had fled to another 
country. During these investigations, 
contradictions were observed in 
the testimonies of individuals who 
claimed Sarah Jasmine had fled, and 
there was no corroborating evidence.
Accordingly, it was decided to once 
again take samples from all buried 
bodies and remains.
On May 7, 2021, with court 
permission, the Government</p>

Analyst's Department, under the leadership 
of the Criminal Investigation Department, the 
Counter-Terrorism and Investigation Division, 
the Colombo Crimes Division, and other 
judicial officers, conducted an investigation 
with Zahran’s widow, Abdul Kader Fatima 
Hadiya, who was present at the house during 
the bombing.
On February 15, 2023, the Government 
Analytical Department reported that 83 
DNA samples, covering all buried body parts 
recovered on April 27, 2022, matched the DNA 
of Sarah's mother. Therefore, forensic reports 
have confirmed that Sarah Jasmine died in the 
explosion at the Saindamarudu house on April 
26, 2019.
Was Sri Lankan military behind the 
attack?
Another conspiracy theory that harmed Sri 
Lanka’s image and reputation was an Easter 
bombings program aired by Channel 4. Based 
on a Muslim asylum seeker Channel 4 claimed 
that former Director General of the State 
Intelligence Service, Suresh Salley, had been in 
contact with Zahran Hashim.
No commission report or any local or foreign 
investigation conducted to date has mentioned 
any connection between Major General Suresh 
Salley and Zahran. Rejecting the allegations 
against Major General Sallay, a Sri Lankan 
government investigation led by Justice Syed 
Ishrat Imam stated:
'Sallay's alibi is an irreversible fact. There is no 
evidence at all to show any involvement on the 
part of Sallay with Zahran or the members of 
the National Tawheed Jamaat, whose mission 
in life is death during the aforesaid period and 
thereafter.
The report further examines the truthfulness 
of allegations, based on statements made 
by a Criminal Investigation Department 
investigator regarding facts presented by 
A photo published on the Islamic State terror group's propaganda outlet, the Amaq agency, on April 23, 2019, showing what the 
group says is eight bombers who carried out the Easter attacks in Sri Lanka</p>

Hansir Maulana to the Channel 4 program:
"Atugodagedera Vijithakumara Wijayaratne of 
the CID spoke about a coconut estate about 80 
acres in extent situated in Vanathavilluwa in 
the Karadiyanpual Grama Niladhari Division. 
This estate had to be accessed through jungle 
land. The access road was not a straight road 
but a road with several bends. There was a 
house built out of cement blocks. The two 
persons whom the police were looking for 
were Abu Haneefa Mohamed Mufess and Abu 
Hansar Mohamed Hamas. They were wanted 
in connection with the destruction of the 
statues of Lord Buddha.
According to Mufee's statement recorded on 
16.01.2019, the house with the cement blocks 
had been constructed about five months 
prior to 16.01.2019, i.e., in or about August–
September 2018. The police had also found 
another house that had been constructed 
in or about August–September 2018. These 
houses were obviously not there when Pillayan 
allegedly requested that a meeting be arranged 
at the said coconut estate in February 2018. 
Azad Maulana was obviously not speaking the 
truth in regard to the alleged meeting on the 
coconut estate.
The report further states:
"We are disturbed that despite reports and 
information being readily available regarding 
the impending April 2019 Easter Sunday bomb 
attack, no action was taken to prevent the 
occurrence of that tragedy."
Hansir Azad Maulana, who claims to be a 
witness on Channel 4, has revealed that he 
had close contact with Supriyaan Mohammed 
Shafraz, the doctor who treated Zahran’s 
brother Rilwan when he was injured in 
a bicycle bomb test five days before the 
Easter attacks. Reportedly, Dr. Shafraz, who 
admitted Rilwan to the hospital, fled Sri 
Lanka immediately after the Easter attacks 
and sought asylum in a foreign country. The 
main reason for his escape was the CID's 
investigation into Rilwan's hospital admission 
and his arrest.
It has also been stated that both this doctor 
and the Channel 4 whistleblower Hanzeer 
Azad Maulana are neighbors in Ebenezer 
Place, Dehiwala, and are also neighbors in 
Azad's village, Kattankudy.
After this medical doctor fled the country, he 
initially worked for a United Nations-affiliated 
organization in a South Asian country, and 
Azad Maulana attempted to get a job with that 
organization through him.
Although the doctor offered him a job in Mali, 
Maulana declined, stating he preferred to go 
to a European country. Subsequently, Maulana 
took steps to obtain political asylum in Europe 
through another method. This is mentioned 
in police reports, and the recently released S.I. 
Imam report has also provided details about 
this.
Accordingly, the committee has recommended 
that charges be filed against Azath Maulana for 
his links with terrorists including Rilwan and 
his close contacts with those who aided the 
terrorists.
Furthermore, the Criminal Investigation 
Department is currently conducting new 
investigations regarding the Channel 4 
program, including these matters, and Suresh 
Saleh retired from his position as Director 
General of the State Intelligence Service before 
these investigations began.

investigators in the investigation of the 
Easter attacks have been raised. International 
investigative assistance has been obtained for 
the Easter attacks investigation. These agencies 
include Interpol, the AFP (Australia), the FBI 
(US), and Scotland Yard (UK).
The FBI investigated the Easter Sunday 
attacks for nearly two years and submitted 
its final report to the Criminal Investigation 
Department in Sri Lanka. As five American 
citizens were dead, the US Department of 
Justice filed a criminal complaint in the Los 
Angeles District Court based on the FBI's 
investigation.
FBI investigations identified three Sri Lankans 
involved in the Easter Sunday attacks and 
charged Mohammed Naufer, alias Naufer 
Maulavi, who was responsible for spreading 
Islamic State ideology in Sri Lanka. Charges 
have been filed in local courts against him for 
recruiting others to IS and leading the training 
necessary to carry out the Easter Sunday 
attacks.
The U.S. Department of Justice stated in its 
official statement:
'The three defendants named in the criminal 
complaint, all of whom pledged allegiance to 
ISIS, are:
- Mohammed Naufar, the "second emir" for 
the group of ISIS supporters that called itself 
"ISIS in Sri Lanka," who allegedly led the 
group's propaganda efforts, recruited others 
to join ISIS, and led a series of multi-day 
military-type trainings;
- Mohamed Anwar Mohamed Riskan, who 
allegedly helped manufacture the IEDs used in 
the Easter attacks; and
- Ahamed Milhan Hayathu Mohamed, who 
allegedly executed a police officer in order to 
obtain the officer's firearm, shot a suspected 
informant and scouted a location for a 
separate terrorist attack.

submitted an inquiry into the investigation 
of the Easter Sunday attacks and its progress, 
as well as a request for another independent 
investigation, to the US State Department. The 
US State Department responded:
"Ambassador Samarasinghe, We stand 
ready to continue providing support to your 
government. It would not make sense for 
the United States to conduct an additional 
investigation into the attacks."
The Australian Federal Police conducted 
investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks, 
during which more than 700 electronic devices 
were subjected to forensic examination, and 
another 33 electronic devices were taken to 
Australia for forensic examination.
In a letter dated March 29, 2022, the then IGP 
asked the Australian Federal Police whether 
there were any findings relevant to the 
investigations. The Australian Federal Police 
replied on April 21, 2022:
"I can advise that the AFP has completed 
all investigations in conjunction with the 
Sri Lanka Police and provided reports and 
conclusions to these authorities."
AFP officers and three officers who assisted 
in the investigation have been included as 
witnesses in the Colombo Three-Judge High 
Court Case No. TAB 2972/21 relating to the 
Easter attacks.
The way forward
It is six years after the Easter Sunday attacks. 
The pursuit of truth and justice remains a 
pressing concern for victims and society. 
While the suicide perpetrators of the attacks 
are no longer alive, numerous individuals 
and networks that supported them—through 
financial, material, and ideological means—
have been identified, arrested, and are 
facing prosecution both in Sri Lanka and 
internationally.
Despite this progress, questions of 
accountability persist, particularly regarding 
the systemic failures and institutional 
negligence that enabled the attacks. 
Accusations have been leveled against 
members of the intelligence community, 
law enforcement, political leadership, and 
bureaucratic institutions—yet several have 
evaded scrutiny and justice. In addition to 
starting a program to rehabilitate the violent 
and radical extremists in custody, the clerics 
and preachers who promote suspicion, 
prejudice, resentment, anger, and hatred 
should be investigated, arrested, prosecuted, 
and rehabilitated. The radical politicians and 
others who promote false narratives and 
conspiracy theories should be punished.
In this unresolved landscape, conspiracy 
theories have proliferated, distorting public 
discourse and hindering the collective pursuit 
of accountability. For some, the tragedy has 
become a socio-political tool or a vehicle for 
personal agendas, further complicating efforts 
to arrive at the truth.
The critical question now remains: who is 
genuinely committed to uncovering the 
truth and delivering justice, and who seeks 
to obscure or delay this process? The answer 
will shape the nation's path toward genuine 
reconciliation and lasting accountability. To 
restore social harmony, political stability, 
and economic prosperity, Sri Lanka and Sri 
Lankans should seek transparency and hold 
their politicians and officials accountable.

"B
eing deeply loved by someone gives you 
strength while loving someone deeply 
gives you courage," wrote Lao Tzu. While not 
everyone may fully subscribe to the sentiments 
of this timeless thinker, one young doctor 
from Sri Lanka—Dr. Thisara Kavinda, a recent 
graduate of the Jaffna Medical Faculty, and his 
wife most certainly do.
“I would have probably ended up a daily-wage 
labourer had I not met her—my then-girlfriend,</p>

now my wife—Bhagya Senarathne,” he said 
in an emotion-laden interview with Jaffna 
Monitor. Standing proudly by his side is 
Bhagya Senarathne herself, an accomplished 
lawyer and alumna of the Faculty of Law, 
University of Colombo.
"Forget about becoming a lawyer," Bhagya 
confessed, her voice trembling with emotion. 
"I might not have even passed my A/L exams 
if I hadn’t met him. Everything I am today—I 
owe to him." Before the weight of her words 
could settle in the air, Dr. Kavinda gently cut 
in, his eyes filled with quiet reverence. "I owe 
my entire life to her."
As the great poet Pablo Neruda once wrote, 
Kavinda continued, "I want to do with you 
what spring does with the cherry trees." Then, 
with a glance full of memory and meaning, he 
added, "She did exactly that to me, iya."
"She walked into the life of an orphan—one 
hardened by toil, bent by grief, and forgotten 
by the world—and made it bloom. She brought 
colour to my grey skies, breath to my weary 
soul, and turned the withering branches of my 
youth into blossoms of hope."
And in that shared breath—the silent 
symphony of two souls suspended between 
heartbeats, in that tender exchange that 
needed no further articulation—lay a truth 
more profound than any poetry ever penned.
Born of Hardship, Raised in Hope
Kavinda was not born into privilege. He came 
from the small village of Thambuththegama 
in Sri Lanka’s Anuradhapura District—
incidentally, also the hometown of the 
country’s current President, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake. Born into extreme poverty, 
Kavinda’s life took a difficult turn before it 
even began: his father abandoned the family 
when he was less than a year old.
In a desperate bid to secure her son's future, 
his mother left for Lebanon to work as a 
domestic aide, leaving young Thisara in the 
care of his grandmother, Dingiri Manike. 
Though she had only studied up to the 
fourth grade, Dingiri Manike was a woman 
of remarkable wisdom and resilience. She 
became his unwavering pillar of strength.
They lived in a small mud hut, without 
electricity, and endured relentless hardship. 
Together, grandmother and grandson toiled in 
the paddy fields to survive.
His mother eventually returned from abroad, 
and for a brief moment, young Thisara’s world 
lit up with hope. “I was overjoyed when she 
came back,” he recalled. But that happiness was 
tragically short-lived. Just months after her 
return, she was diagnosed with blood cancer—

and passed away while Thisara was preparing 
for his Ordinary Level (O/L) examinations.
“My life shattered completely,” he said. “We 
went bankrupt after my mother’s death. 
Society turned its back on us. I had no one left 
but my grandmother—and she was already 
quite old.”
Left with no other option, Thisara began 
working as a child labourer to help sustain his 
household.
“I did whatever work I could find—assisting 
masons, doing cleaning jobs, working in the 
fields—anything and everything,” he said, 
reflecting on those grueling years of survival.
Yet, despite the crushing hardships, his 
commitment to education never wavered. He 
attended Bellankadawala Maha Vidyalaya, 
a humble village school, where he excelled 
academically—earning six A’s in his O/L 
examinations. It was a life-changing 
achievement that secured him admission 
to Anuradhapura Central College for his 
Advanced Level studies.
Love at First Sight
“I was in the Bio stream at Anuradhapura 
Central College,” Thisara Kavinda recalled. 
“One day, I casually dropped by the classroom 
of a friend who was in the Maths stream. That’s 
when I first saw her—Bhagya, his classmate. 
It felt like just another moment back then, but 
looking back, it was the moment everything 
changed.”
"I instantly fell in love with that innocent-
looking girl," Kavinda confessed, his voice 
softened by the passage of time and the depth 
of his feelings. "What I didn’t realize then," 
he continued, his gaze drifting as if lost in the 
echoes of the past, "was that she would become 
the turning point in my life—the one who 
would fill the aching void left by my mother’s 
death."
She reciprocated his love a few months later. 
That moment, as Kavinda recalled, felt like 
a rebirth. "I had no one, and then, suddenly, 
it felt as though all the angels’ blessings had 
descended upon me."
Bhagya, the daughter of a former Director 
of Sinhala Language at the North Central 
Provincial Education Department, hailed from 
a modest but stable middle-class background. 
Despite their vastly different upbringings, 
she saw in Thisara something exceptional—
authenticity, humility, and a quiet but 
unwavering determination.
"This schoolgirl," he began, "added colour to 
my dark life—like a vibrant bloom against a 
stark canvas." He paused a flicker of the past 
in his eyes. "Back then," he continued, "I had 
nothing in this world to truly call my own. 
My heart felt like an empty room, echoing 
with silence." A poignant truth hung in the 
air. Then, a warmth entered his tone—a light 
breaking through the shadows. "Yet, she fell 
in love with me," he said, "Me—a boy with 
no parents, no wealth to offer, no money to 
his name, and no guaranteed future. Just a 
student, and a menial worker, grappling with 
his A/Levels. While her friends, perhaps 
understandably, looked for boys with the 
markers of a secure future—vehicles, status—
she laughed and walked with me, hand in 
hand, deeply in love."
"When I met him," Bhagya began, "I saw the 
most innocent boy—someone who was in 
desperate need of genuine love. There was a 
purity about him, a vulnerability that touched 
my soul."</p>

She paused, a soft smile likely gracing her lips 
as she recalled those early days. "He was doing 
pottery, taking on rental work. He walked to 
school just to save the bus fare. He was fighting 
for survival in every way possible." Her voice 
then took on a deeper resonance. "And in that 
boy," she continued, I saw not just a lover, not 
someone to share fleeting moments with—I 
saw my best friend. I saw the one person with 
whom I could navigate life’s entire journey, 
hand in hand, through its sunshine and its 
storms."
The Promise
The shadow of the Advanced Level 
examinations loomed large. When the results 
finally arrived, Thisara Kavinda had done 
well—not quite achieving his ultimate dream 
of entering medical school, but securing 
two Bs and a C, more than enough to gain 
admission into a bioscience or any other 
reputable degree program at a Sri Lankan 
university.</p>

73
But then came a decision that surprised 
many—he didn’t even apply.
His explanation, when it came, was 
disarmingly simple. "Bhagya had failed in 
the Maths stream," he told Jaffna Monitor. 
"I couldn’t bring myself to leave her behind. 
The thought of stepping forward into a new 
chapter without her felt like tearing myself in 
two."
Bhagya, reflecting on that time, echoed his 
sentiment with quiet emotion "He refused 
to move forward without me," she affirmed. 
"We made a promise—to study hard and 
enter university together." Bhagya switched to 
the Arts stream, while Thisara continued in 
Biology.
Every morning, the two made their way to 
the Anuradhapura Public Library, where they 
studied side by side—until the doors closed 
each evening. "She brought food for me every 
day," Thisara recalled warmly.
"I’m naturally a lazy person," Bhagya laughed, 
"but he motivated me in every possible way."
Although the library had separate seating 
areas for boys and girls, they always chose 
spots where they could see each other. "If I 
felt sleepy or lost focus, he’d signal to me from 
across the room," she said, smiling at the 
memory. Their shared dream, Bhagya revealed 
to Jaffna Monitor, was to enter the University 
of Peradeniya—home to both the Medical and 
Law faculties. "We hoped to go there so we 
could stay close while pursuing our respective 
ambitions," she said.
To keep himself afloat, Thisara found refuge 
and kindness in the home of a friend’s 
family in Anuradhapura town. There, within 
unfamiliar walls, he channeled the same fierce 
determination he had once poured into back-
breaking labour into the demanding world of 
A/L studies.
He took her along that journey. Together, 
they were laying a new foundation—brick by 
painstaking brick.
Then came the moment they had both worked 
so tirelessly for—the culmination of months of 
sacrifice and unwavering dedication.
Bhagya, fueled by a spirit that refused to 
be defined by a single setback, rose to the 
challenge with breathtaking strength. In just 
six months, she transformed disappointment 
into triumph, securing three A's—a feat that 
earned her a coveted place at the Colombo 
Law College.
And Thisara—the boy once dismissed, whose 
worth had been measured in the sweat of his 
brow, the boy who walked miles to save a few 
rupees—had shattered every expectation. He 
secured admission to the prestigious Jaffna 
Medical Faculty.
Though their dream of studying together at 
Peradeniya was not realised, they had achieved 
something far more meaningful—they had 
risen, together.
A New Beginning
Their love only grew stronger—despite the 
physical distance between Colombo and 
Jaffna, separated by more than 300 kilometers 
and long, tiresome hours of travel. "There 
were times we could meet only once or twice a 
year," Bhagya recalled. "But love doesn’t always 
require physical presence. Sometimes, it just 
needs spiritual presence."
Their bond echoed the tender words of 
American poet E.E. Cummings, who once</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
74
wrote: "I carry your heart with me (I carry it in 
my heart)...
I am never without it (anywhere I go you 
go, my dear)." For Thisara and Bhagya, 
this wasn’t just poetry—it was the absolute 
truth. Even when miles apart, they carried 
each other’s presence within them, quietly 
and constantly—proof that love, when true, 
transcends both time and distance.
Now, recently married and newly graduated, 
they have found a way to stay close despite 
the demands of their professions. Thisara 
is currently serving his internship at the 
Panadura Hospital, while Bhagya is practicing 
law in Colombo.
"Finally, destiny brought us to a place where 
we can be together," Bhagya said, smiling 
as she looked at her husband by her side—a 
moment that felt like the quiet fulfilment 
of a long-promised dream. "She made me 
blossom into who I am today," he said, his 
eyes reflecting a quiet indebtedness—to 
the universe, and to the little girl who once 
believed in a boy with nothing but dreams.
Their love story whispered through the ages, 
finds its echo in the ancient Tamil verses 
of Kurunthokai. Like the poet Sembula 
Peyaneerar sang in Kurunthokai 40:
"ahAk; QhAk; ahu; MfpaNuh?
ve;ijAk; Ee;ijAk; vk; Kiwf; Nfspu;?
ahDk; ePAk; vt; top mwpJk;?
nrk; Gyg; ngay; ePu; Nghy
md;Gil neQ;rk; jhk; fye;jdNt."
(Loosely translated as: “Our mothers are 
strangers. So are our fathers. You and I—we 
were once unknown to each other. Yet here 
we are—our hearts mingled, as inseparably as 
rainwater sinking into red earth.”)
Thisara and Bhagya’s love was just that—
unwritten by lineage, untouched by status, 
and unknown to fate. It was a bond that defied 
every boundary. Like rain finding its way 
home to the parched earth, their hearts found 
in each other something timeless, something 
whole.
As the greatest poet of Tamil, Bharathi, once 
declared:
'Mjypdhw; fhjy; nra;tPu;&gt; cyfj;jPNu!
m/jd;Nwh ,t;Tyfj; jiyikapd;gk;."
(“Therefore, love—O people of the world! For 
is that not the greatest joy in life?”)
Indeed, what is life, if not illuminated by the 
radiant flame of love?</p>
