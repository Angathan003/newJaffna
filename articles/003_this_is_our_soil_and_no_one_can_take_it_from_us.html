This is Our Soil. And No One 
Can Take It From Us.
F
ebruary 4th, Sri Lanka’s Independence Day, is a day 
of both celebration and contention. As the nation 
marked 77 years of sovereignty, some Tamils—whose 
lands remain militarily occupied and whose sons and 
daughters have vanished without a trace—chose to 
observe the day with symbolic defiance. For them, it was 
a solemn reminder of unresolved grievances, systemic 
marginalization, and the continued erosion of their 
fundamental rights.
However, another faction—politically opportunistic 
Tamil nationalists—seized the moment for their own 
agenda. They operate in the spirit of the Tamil proverb 
"Gaining from a house on fire" (vupapw tPl;by; GLq;FwJ 
yhgk;). These elements, heavily bankrolled by segments 
of the diaspora, sought to manipulate the occasion, 
not for genuine advocacy, but to sustain their political 
relevance by perpetuating division. With calculated 
rhetoric, they deliberately sought to reframe Independence 
Day as a ‘Black Day,’ fostering resentment rather than 
reconciliation.
The Hypocrisy of Tamil Political Opportunists
And then there’s Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam—
Colombo-born and bred, a product of Royal College 
and Colombo International School, an elite wrapped in 
privilege and affluence. More fluent in Sinhala than Tamil, 
he has spent much of his life surrounded by Sinhala 
friends, effortlessly navigating the very society he claims 
to oppose. And yet, the irony runs deep—his multimillion-
dollar investments are not in the war-ravaged Tamil 
regions he professes to represent, but in Sinhala-majority 
areas, where his wealth quietly flourishes.

Standing beside him is ITAK President-elect 
Sritharan—once a political adversary, now a 
convenient ally. Their newfound camaraderie 
emerged not from ideological alignment 
but from political survival, triggered by 
the unexpected rise of the NPP, a Sinhala-
majority party that made inroads into the 
North and East in the last parliamentary 
election. Sensing a threat, they set aside their 
differences, united by opportunism rather than 
principle.
On Independence Day, they staged a rally 
in Kilinochchi—an event that bore all the 
hallmarks of a diaspora-funded protest, 
Amidst the protest, Gajendrakumar 
Ponnambalam stood front and center, hoisting 
a placard that read: "We reject all political 
solutions under a unitary state constitution."
A bold declaration, one that might have 
carried weight—if only he truly believed in it. 
But here lies the glaring paradox.
The Oath of Loyalty: Words vs. Actions
Every Member of Parliament in Sri Lanka 
is bound by an oath—a solemn declaration 
that affirms their commitment to upholding 
and defending the Constitution of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. 
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam himself has 
taken this very oath:
"I, Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, do 
solemnly declare and affirm/swear that I will 
uphold and defend the Constitution of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."
This Constitution, without ambiguity, defines 
Sri Lanka as a unitary state.
Given his staunch opposition to this 
framework, one must ask: Why does 
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam continue to 
hold a parliamentary seat within a system 
he so vehemently denounces? Why does 
his party actively contest elections under a 
Constitution he publicly repudiates? If his 
ideological convictions were sincere, would 
not integrity demand that he reject the very 
oath that binds him to this state?
The contradiction is glaring. On one hand, 
he benefits from the privileges and platform 
provided by the Sri Lankan Parliament. 
On the other, he relentlessly fuels Tamil 
discontent, leveraging the same system he 
claims to oppose.
If he truly rejects the unitary state, logic and 
integrity would dictate that he renounce his 
parliamentary position, reject the privileges 
it affords him, and stand by his purported 
beliefs in their entirety. Instead, his continued 
participation suggests a strategic exploitation 
of the system—one that sustains his political 
relevance while perpetuating division.
Such duplicity does not advance the cause of 
Tamil rights; rather, it undermines genuine 
discourse by reducing it to a tool for political 
survival.
Tamil Identity and the Struggle for Dignity
As a Tamil, as a minority in this land, I 
carry the weight of history—the wounds of 
injustice, the scars of systemic discrimination 
that began long before my time. I have not 
forgotten the disenfranchisement of Indian 
Tamils in 1948, a cruel betrayal that stripped 
an entire people of their voice—ironically, 
with the backing of G.G. Ponnambalam, the 
grandfather of Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. 
I cannot erase the memory of the Sinhala 
Only Act in 1956, which deepened our 
alienation and told us, in no uncertain terms,</p>

that we did not belong. And I cannot ignore 
the decades of suffering that followed, the 
violence, the loss, the unfulfilled dreams of 
a people who only ever wanted dignity and 
equality.
But tell me—does that mean we must 
abandon our motherland? Must we turn away 
from the soil that cradled us, the rivers that 
whispered our ancestors’ names, the air that 
carries the scent of our history? No. The sins 
of politicians do not define this land. It is not 
the earth beneath our feet that betrayed us—
it was men, selfish and power-hungry, who 
divided us for their own gain.
This is our home. No politician, no policy, no 
oppression can take that away from us.
This is the same land where our ancestors 
shed their blood—not merely in defiance 
of the Sri Lankan state, but long before 
that, against foreign invaders who sought to 
subjugate us.
Are we to forsake our heritage because of the 
challenges we face, or should we stand our 
ground and fight for our rightful place within 
this nation?
Those who have brazenly declared 
February 4th a “Black Day” must confront 
a fundamental question: Was Pandara 
Vanniyan, our Tamil warrior-hero, a traitor 
for resisting British imperialism? Should we 
erase the legacy of countless Tamil warriors 
who valiantly opposed colonial domination? 
Is our history to be reduced to selective 
amnesia, dictated by transient political 
opportunism?
A Path Forward: Rejecting Separatism, 
Embracing Engagement
For three harrowing decades, our community 
bore the brunt of an unforgiving war. We 
endured unfathomable sacrifices, widespread 
devastation, and the annihilation of an entire 
generation. Nearly 40,000 LTTE cadres—
our own sons and daughters of Sri Lanka—
were obliterated. Add to that the tens of 
thousands of Tamil civilians who perished, 
the multitudes who were displaced, and those 
brutally executed by the LTTE as ‘traitors,’ 
and the death toll soars to staggering, almost 
incomprehensible levels. And let us not 
forget—ours is a tiny nation. For the Tamil 
people, this war eradicated nearly 10% 
of our population. If that weren’t enough, 
mass migration further hollowed out our 
communities.
Statistical records indicate that Jaffna had a 
larger population in the 1970s than it does 
today. Can we even begin to grasp the sheer 
magnitude of such demographic decimation? 
The scale of this decline is nothing short of 
catastrophic.
Today, the LTTE is no more. The armed 
struggle is extinguished and reduced to a 
relic of the past. There is no battlefield left, 
no military path to tread. The only pragmatic 
course is to accept Sri Lanka as our homeland 
and wage our fight for justice from within. 
Clinging to the mirage of separatism is not 
only a delusional fallacy but a suicidal folly—
one that will condemn the Tamil people to 
perpetual stagnation and suffering.
History is filled with examples of minorities 
who embraced national identities and 
flourished. The Jews in the United States, the 
Chinese in Malaysia, Muslims in India—none 
of them dwelled in perpetual grievance. They 
engaged, adapted, and claimed their rightful 
place in their nations.</p>

Likewise, Sri Lanka is our home. 
Why should we allow radical 
agitators—both within the diaspora 
and at home—to manipulate our 
destiny?
Tamils, the time has come to move 
forward. It is time to reclaim our 
rightful place in this nation—not 
as rebels, not as exiles, but as Sri 
Lankans. We must seize control of 
our own destiny, fight to secure our 
rights through democratic means, 
and build a future where our children 
thrive—not in displacement, not in 
uncertainty, but here, in the land we 
call home.
To the Tamil hardliners who demand 
I disown my country, and to the 
Sinhala hardliners who deny us our 
rightful place within it, hear me: 
I draw strength from the words of 
Jaguar Paw, son of Flint Sky, in 
Apocalypto Movie: "I am Jaguar 
Paw, son of Flint Sky. My father 
hunted this forest before me. My 
name is Jaguar Paw. I am a hunter. 
This is my forest. And my sons will 
hunt it with their sons after I am 
gone."<br />
"I am Kaniyan Pungundran, son 
of this ancient soil. My ancestors 
walked this land before me, their 
footsteps etched into its very soul. 
My name is Kaniyan Pungundran. 
I am a son of Sri Lanka. This is my 
land. And my children will walk 
upon it with their children long after 
I am gone."
Warm regards,
