T
he British brought Sri Lanka completely 
under their control in 1815. The 
British needed a political system and a 
parliamentary administration to govern Sri 
Lanka. A commission was established in 1829 
under the leadership of William Colebrooke 
and Charles Cameron to examine these 
arrangements. The system they proposed is 
known as the Colebrooke-Cameron Reforms.
The First Indigenous Representatives
According to the Colebrooke Reforms, 
the Legislative Council, consisting of 15 
members, was established. It included 9 
official members and 6 unofficial members. 
Among the 6 unofficial members, there 
were 3 Europeans, 1 Sinhalese, 1 Tamil, and 
1 Burgher. Based on that, Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy was appointed as the 
first Tamil representative in the legislative 
tradition of Sri Lanka, J.G. Phillips 
Panditeratne1 (Johannes Godfried Phillipz 
Wijekoon Panditeratne) was appointed as the

first Sinhalese member, and J.C. Hillebrand 
(J.G. Hillebrand) was appointed as the first 
Burgher member.2
At that time, Coomaraswamy was serving as 
the translator for the Commissioner of the 
Revenue Department. Phillips Panditeratne 
was serving as the Sinhalese translator for the 
Supreme Court.

Interestingly, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, a 
significant political figure, descended from the 
lineage of J.G. Philipsz Panditaratne.
During this period, elections had not been 
introduced to Sri Lanka, so the Governor had 
the practice of selecting anyone he desired at 
his discretion. Governor Sir Robert Wilmot-
Horton found it easy to appoint the 9 official 
members. However, finding and selecting 
the 6 unofficial members was challenging. 
He easily found the three Europeans and one 
Burgher. But, unable to find the remaining two 
representatives, the first meeting on 01.10.1833 
convened without any Sri Lankan indigenous 
members.
The then Secretary of State for the Colonies 
rebuked this situation. Subsequently, in haste, 
the Governor retired his chief translators, 
Arumugampillai and Philipsz Panditharatne, 
with full pay and appointed them as unofficial 
members on 30.05.1835. Arumugampillai was 
the Chief Mudaliyar, and Philipsz Panditaratne 
was a Mudaliyar.3
Accordingly, he was the first representative of 
Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims.4 He can also

be considered the first Indigenous member 
in the parliamentary history of Sri Lanka. At 
that time, the Tamil and Muslim communities 
were represented under the identity of 
Tamils, so Arumugampillai served as the 
representative of the Muslims as well. Later, Sir 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan, who came from 
the same lineage, argued against the demand 
for separate representation for Muslims, which 
is another story altogether.
Name Confusion
It is observed that his name is called by various 
confusing names by many. In the famous 
book "North to Gopallawa" (1966) by K. C. 
Kularatnam, he is called Arumugatha Pillai. 
M. Vaithilingam, who wrote the biography of 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan (The Life of Sir 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan - 1971), refers to 
him as "Arumuganathapillai" in several places.5 
In the books of A. J. Wilson, he is also called 
"Arumuganathapillai." In the "Dictionary of 
Biography of the Tamils of Ceylon" (1997) 
compiled by S. Arumugam, he is mentioned 
as Arumugampillai. V. Muthukumaraswamy, 
in his book "Founders of Modern Ceylon 
Eminent Tamils" (1973), also wrote a chapter

sion Press Tellippalai Ceylon - 1923.

referring to him as Arumugampillai. Let us 
also call him Arumugampillai Kumaraswamy.
Biography
Gate Mudaliar Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy was born in 1783 in 
the village of Kerudavil in Point Pedro 
(Paruthithurai), Sri Lanka. His elder brother, 
Variththampi, settled in the Chekkatti Street 
area of Colombo and became a prominent 
merchant. He then moved to Aamaithottam 
in the Mukhathuvaaram area and lived 
there.6 The Ponnambalam family, who later 
became influential political leaders centered 
in Colombo, started from here. At that time, 
areas like Kotahena, central Colombo, and 
Colombo North were centers where prominent 
aristocrats and merchants of Sri Lanka lived. 
Only later did the Kuruwatta area, today's 
Colombo 7, become a center for high-class 
influential aristocrats. The Ponnambalam 
family also moved to Colombo 7.
In 1795, the British captured the Trincomalee 
Fort from the Dutch. The forts in Jaffna, 
Kalpitiya, and Negombo also surrendered. 
Following this, the then-Dutch Governor was

prepared to hand over the forts in Kalutara, 
Galle, and Matara to the British. Finally, in 
1796, Colombo naturally fell into the hands 
of the British. During the period when full 
control was being established in Sri Lanka, the 
Governor from Madras managed Sri Lanka's 
administration.
Variththampi was involved in identifying and 
importing numerous personnel from South 
India for administrative work. At that time, 
he brought 13-year-old Coomaraswamy to 
Colombo and cared for him.
By order of the King of England, it was decided 
to appoint a separate governor to manage Sri 
Lanka as a distinct colonial state. Accordingly, 
the King appointed Frederick North as the 
first governor in October 1798. However, until 
it was officially confirmed in 1802 that Sri 
Lanka was formally under the British Crown, 
Sri Lanka operated under the authority of the 
Governor of India.
Frederick North made several changes upon 
his arrival. There was an immediate need to 
establish a school for the education of the 
children of both the aristocrats and the English 
administrators. This school was established 
in Colombo on 28.10.1799. At the same time, 
the British recognized the long-term need to</p>

develop local talent for their administrative 
needs. A section was created with 18 Sinhalese 
students in the northeast corner of the 
Wolvendaal Church in Colombo. Although 
a Tamil section was also created by Father 
Schroter, only a few attended. Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy was admitted to the 
school within a year of its establishment. 
Coomaraswamy's exceptional abilities quickly 
led him to successive advancements.
Service Rendered
In 1805, he was appointed as a translator in 
the Colombo Fort Court. Three years later, 
Richard Plasket, then the Deputy Secretary of 
the Government, certified Coomaraswamy as 
a skilled talent. In 1808, Coomaraswamy was 
appointed as a translator for Governor Thomas 
Maitland. Later, in May 1810, he was promoted 
to the Chief Tamil Translator to the Governor 
and was awarded the title of Mudaliyar. At that 
time, he was only 26 years old.
During this period, many recorded a shadow 
conflict between the Chettiar community, 
which had migrated from South India, and 
the Saiva Vellala community of Jaffna. M. 
Vaithilingam, who wrote the biography of Sir 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan, also recorded 
how Coomaraswamy maintained his position 
with the support of the Vellala community 
during this struggle.7
For over a century, the 
descendants of Coomaraswamy, 
who had come from Jaffna, 
remained in Colombo 
and wielded influence in 
national politics. It was only 
after a century, having been 
disappointed by the Sinhalese 
leadership, that they returned 
to their ancestral land in Jaffna. 
This occurred around the 1920s, which is 
another story.
In the early 1800s, the influence of the Chettiar 
community, which had established itself as a 
trading community in Colombo, also grew. 
In 1830, Coomaraswamy was elected as the 
leader of the "non-Christian Tamils" in the 
capital city of Colombo. This election took 
place in the Provincial Secretariat. Thiyagappa, 
a prominent figure in the arrack production 
industry and an influential member of the 
Chettiar community, competed against 
Coomaraswamy. This election was, in a way, a 
peaceful fight between the Saiva Vellalar and 
Saiva Chettiar communities.
In 1815, during the capture of King Sri 
Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy by the British, 
Coomaraswamy played a significant role as a 
translator for the British. During this period, 
Arumugampillai was sent along with the 
army dispatched to capture Kandy as a direct 
officer of the Governor. In February 1815, he 
traveled with the army from Colombo for 14 
days. When the King of Kandy, Sri Vikrama 
Rajasinha, was captured and sent to Colombo, 
Coomaraswamy was assigned to assist in 
exiling the king and his relatives to Vellore.

Abolition of Slavery
The slavery system, which had continued 
during the Portuguese and Dutch periods, 
persisted into the early period of British rule as 
well. Many individuals in the country owned 
slaves as property. Families were sold together, 
or children were separated from their fathers, 
children from their mothers, and husbands 
and wives were cruelly separated and sold 
individually. During this period, there were a 
total of 28,000 slaves on the island of Sri Lanka 
alone. Among them, 22,000 slaves were in 
Jaffna and Trincomalee. The price of a male 
slave was 17 rupees, and the price of a female 
slave was 34 rupees. It is also noteworthy that 
slavery was abolished in Mauritius and the 
West Indies in 1833.
In commemoration of the birthday of the 
Prince Regent of England, a large list of 
prominent Sri Lankans who signed in support 
of the abolition of slavery on 12.08.1816 can be 
found (Ceylon Ordinances - 1853).8 Notably, 
those who signed were divided according to 
8 A Collection Of Legislative Acts Of The Ceylon 
Government From 1796: Colombo - William Skeen, 
Goverment printer, Ceylon - 1853
their castes. These groups included Vellalar, 
Karaiyar, Vannar, and Chettiar, among others. 
This list, which contains nearly a thousand 
signatures, was divided by region, caste, and 
ethnicity.9 Among the signatories in the list of 
Colombo Malabars (Colombo Tamils) is the 
name of Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy.
The details of the gradual liberation of slaves 
from various regions have also been published. 
In the late 1819s, the courts of that time 
intervened and liberated slaves belonging 
to the Pallars, Koviyars, and Nalavars 
communities in the Jaffna and Trincomalee 
areas. These details are explained on the pages 
of the report as mentioned earlier.
Praise from the British
In recognition of Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy's service, Governor Robert 
Brownrigg awarded him a medal and a gold 
necklace in 1819. The inscription on the medal 
reads as follows: "This medal is presented 
9 In this list, Tamils are referred to as Malabaris. You 
may be aware that during the Portuguese period and 
later during the Dutch  period, Tamils were recorded 
as Malabaris in most places. Similarly, when they re-
ferred to the Sinhalese as Sinhalese, they did not refer 
to them as "Sinhalese" as they do today."Cingalese."

to Arumuganathapillai Coomaraswamy 
Mudaliyar by the Honorable Sir Robert 
Brownrigg, Governor, during his term of 
office, in appreciation of his distinguished 
and satisfactory public service as the Chief 
Translator of the Government."10
Coomaraswamy married Visalatchi, and they 
had two children, Muthu Coomaraswamy and 
Sellachi. Muthu Coomaraswamy was the father 
of Sir Ananda Coomaraswamy. Sellachi's 
children were Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy, 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, and Sir 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam.
Arumugampillai also served under Governor 
Sir Edward Paget (1822-1824) and Governor 
Sir Edward Barnes (1824-1831).
Death
Although Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy 
was appointed to the Legislative Council in 
1835, he could not attend the subsequent 
session. He passed away on 07.11.1836.11 Thus, 
he held the position for approximately one 
and a half years. The history of the political 
power structure of that time confirms that no 
member of that first Legislative Council could, 
or did, play a significant role as a political 
representative. However, he holds the honor

member. His contributions to civil service were 
notable and historically significant. Likewise, 
his successors continued to fill his place.

11 This date can be obtained in V.Muttucumaraswamy 
- Some Eminent Tamils – Department of Hindu &amp; 
Cultural Affairs (1992),  while K.C. Kularatnam in 
North First Gopallawa states that his date of death is 
14.05.1837.
After his death, Governor Robert Horton 
delivered an emotional eulogy for him on 
07.11.1836.12 The Governor faced difficulties 
in selecting another person to fill his position. 
For one and a half years, Coomaraswamy's 
position remained vacant. Finally, the 
Governor appointed Simon Cassie Chitty, a 
distinguished civil service officer and scholar 
from Kalpitiya, who retired from his post to 
become the unofficial Tamil representative.13
After Coomaraswamy, Simon Cassie 
Chitty was appointed, followed by 
Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy's son-
in-law, Edirmannasingham Mudaliyar. 
Subsequently, his son Muthukumaraswamy 
and later his son-in-law Ramanathan were 
appointed. After them, Coomaraswamy's 
descendants continued to be appointed. The 
Coomaraswamy family provided political 
representation in Sri Lanka from the time 
of the first political reform, the Colebrooke-
Cameron Reforms, to the period of the 
Donoughmore Reforms.
The seed that Coomaraswamy planted in 
the political history of Tamils in Sri Lanka is 
remarkable when considering the political 
milestones influenced by his family's impact 
over the past one and a half centuries. The 
political transformations brought about by 
their influence are astonishing. We do not 
know as much about those who came after him 
as we do about him.

ils of Sri Lanka – London - 1996

In those days the appointees were permanent 
members, no election, no term of membership, and 
the appointment and  extension were at the pleasure of 
the Governor.</p>

he melody of the harmonium blending with 
the rhythms of the percussion instrument 
mridangam wafted through the air.
The cacophonous voice of the background singer 
followed, over the loudspeaker.
These were the signs foretelling the imminent 
arrival of the popular sinnamēḷam dance</p>

performance. A sudden bustle started to sizzle 
among the temple-goers. 
People who were bored by the mēḷaccamā—
the playful back-and-forth between the 
thavil drummers—and were lounging on 
their sālvais spread out on the sand, woke up 
abruptly and started to swarm towards the 
temple hall.
Commotion and cheering ensued. 
What the crowd had been staying awake for 
in this cold weather until two in the morning, 
was about to begin.
The temple hall was filled within half a 
second. Crowds teemed everywhere.
The famous Kamalā-Vimalā dance troupe was 
set to perform that day. No wonder that the 
hall was full.
The sound of salaṅkai-the ankle ornament 
with little bells-drifted over. The entire crowd 
forgot to blink and turned their heads towards 
the direction whence the salaṅkai sound 
came.
Two dancers walked towards the center of the 
stage, elegantly like swans. Once they reached 
the center, they glanced around at the crowds 
surrounding the center stage and graced them 
with a smile.
The smile had the power to enchant every 
single person in the audience.
“aaḷai aaḷaip pārkkiṟār ….,” the loudspeaker 
started blaring a popular cinema song.
The dance began. As the harmonium player 
kept the tune and the mridangam drummer 
showcased his skill, the two dancers twisted 
and swirled.
Their contortions captivated the hearts of the 
audience and enthralled them.
The crowd jostled expectantly, hoping to 
catch a glimpse of the sinnamēḷam dance.
Outside, under a tree a little distance away 
from the temple building, there was a crowd 
that had come to witness the festivities.
Surely, they, too, would want to enjoy the 
dance performance, wouldn’t they?
They would, with all their heart. But …
They could not step inside the temple with the 
others to participate in the festivities. They 
did not have that privilege.
They were dalits, people from the 
downtrodden, segregated, lower castes  …
They could not see anything that was going 
on within the temple. They merely heard the 
songs and the sounds of salaṅkai over the 
loudspeakers. From the sounds, they had 
to fill in the gaps by imagining the dance 
performance.

Kandasāmi was dissatisfied. He had stayed 
up till two in the morning to watch the 
sinnamēḷam performance. How could he 
instead settle for merely watching the backs of 
the thronging masses from a distance?
He fumed at his mother Vaḷḷi. He wanted to 
go near the temple to get a better look at the 
dance performance. But she had forbidden it, 
absolutely.
She, too, was angry at him. When all the poor 
souls under the tree were content to enjoy 
the festivities from a distance, why was he so 
impatient?</p>

No one could fault him. He was just an 
eight-year-old tot who did not understand 
the intricacies and goresqueness of societal 
conventions.
Vaḷḷi had been very firm. He was not to move 
even an inch from where he was standing.
Kandasāmi was equally firm: he had resolved 
to himself that he would somehow give his 
mother the slip to go watch sinnamēḷam.
When Vaḷḷi dozed off momentarily, 
Kandasāmi saw his chance and made his 
move.
He rushed towards the temple and blended 
into the crowd that was enjoying the dance.
But no matter how he allowed himself to be 
crushed and trodden on, he could not see what 
was going on inside. He circled the crowd to 
no avail.
Frustrated, he was ready to give up and return 
back to where he came from, when he spotted 
a good vantage point.
There, in the women’s section, on the side of 
the ceremonial temple flagpole.
Somehow, he reached that spot, climbing over 
some people, being trodden on by others, and 
squeezing himself through between yet others.
As he sat there and watched the dance, he 
marveled at its novelty and beauty.</p>

He was thoroughly absorbed in enjoying the 
performance.
Then - 
“Dēy, you low-caste scoundrel, who let you 
in. Get out at once, you dog…”
- This was the voice of vithāṉaiyār 
Veluppiḷḷai, the government official in the 
village.
Kandasāmi did not remember what happened 
thereafter. He was dragged outside brutally. 
Everyone had a go at him. They beat him until 
he fainted.
Someone dragged Vaḷḷi by her wrist to where 
he lay.
- “Look at what your kid has done. He has 
stepped inside the temple…. The devil…..”
- “He has done something that no one has ever 
done before…..”
- “How can we continue the festival without a 
ritual atonement?.....”
Vaḷḷi’s world was spinning around her….
Kandasāmi lay unconscious on the ground, 
like a corpse. Blood was oozing out of his 
face and mouth, making his tender face look 
grotesque. No one sympathized with his 
situation. Instead, there was plenty of abuse, 
scorn, and swearing….
But it did not stop there.
-“Take him away, the devil, the dog…,” 
vithāṉaiyār Veluppiḷḷai again kicked the 
curled up body of Kandasāmi.
Even after Kandasāmi was unconscious, 
oblivious to everything around him, 
vithāṉaiyār’s anger did not subside. “Vaḷḷi, I 
am letting him go just for your sake, just for 
the sake of your face. Had he been anyone 
else’s child, he would be lying dead now for 
what he has done… I held myself back for 
your sake…. Mmm.. lift him up,” he growled.
Like a lifeless machine, Vaḷḷi lifted 
Kandasāmi over her shoulder without uttering 
a word, and walked away.
3
Kandasāmi lay on a torn straw mat, moaning. 
Vaḷḷi sat next to him, gently stroking his body.
They had no one to help them…. They only 
had each other. Vaḷḷi’s husband Siṉṉathampi 
had passed away two years earlier.
Vaḷḷi stared at Kandasāmi’s face.
That face….
-The memory brought out a surge of sadness 
in her. Tears streamed down her cheeks. The 
face rekindled long-forgotten memories.
The memories trampled on by time slowly 
raised their heads.
Her thoughts zoomed back to several years 
prior.
It must have been just a year or two after 
Siṉṉathampi married her. Her beauty and his 
masculinity entwined in each other. They led 
a happy life.
The livelihood of that family depended 
entirely on vithāṉaiyār Veluppiḷḷai. 
Siṉṉathampi worked his land. Vaḷḷi did his 
household chores. Veluppiḷḷai paid very little 
for their work. They were used to living their 
lives within that meager income.
That day, vithāṉaiyār had sent Siṉṉathampi 
off to another village on some errand.</p>

Vaḷḷi would have had to sleep alone that night.
When she finished her chores and prepared to 
leave, vithāṉaiyār said, “Why don’t you sleep 
here, Vaḷḷi? How would you sleep at home, 
alone without anyone to help?”
“No, sāmi… why would I need any help… I 
can sleep alone.,” Vaḷḷi said as she left.
At around eleven that evening, Vaḷḷi shut her 
front door tight, put the lamp out, and was 
about to go to bed. She heard someone calling 
out her name.
“Vaḷḷi … Vaḷḷi …”
Who would that be? It sounded like the voice 
of vithāṉaiyār.
She opened the door a little. She was right, 
vithāṉaiyār Veluppiḷḷai stood outside.
“Why sāmi… at this hour?”
“Nothing. You were going to go to bed alone. 
I came to check if you were afraid…”
Vaḷḷi was overcome with joy. What a 
kindhearted person!
Vaḷḷi came out onto the front yard.
The blackness of the moonless night reigned 
supreme.It was then that it happened.</p>

“Vaḷḷi,” Veluppiḷḷai said, as he grabbed her 
wrist.
She instantly understood the reason for his 
visit, and the hidden motive that lurked 
beneath his kindness.
She jerked her wrist free and ran inside the 
house.
Like lightning, he followed her inside.
Then? ….
She sobbed into her pillow until dawn. She 
wept until the sorrow within her heart was 
exhausted.
4
Kandasāmi’s moaning put an end to Vaḷḷi’s 
reverie.
She chastened herself for allowing her stray 
thoughts to confuse her mind.
Even in the middle of his unbearable pain, a 
gentle smile formed on Kandasāmi’s lips.
That face… that smile…
- It was as if vithāṉaiyār Veluppiḷḷai stood 
there smiling.
Arun Siddharth has been appointed as the chief organizer for the 
Jaffna district by the Mawbima Janatha Party. This appointment 
was made during a lively event held in Colombo under the 
leadership of the party's chairman, Dilith Jayaweera.
Arun Siddharth, who had recently joined the United National 
Party (UNP), decided to switch allegiances to the Mawbima 
Janatha Party. When asked about his decision, "The UNP party 
sidelined me based on caste," he claimed. "That is why I left. The 
decision to join the Mawbima Janatha Party was driven by the 
pursuit of effective resolutions to combat oppression."
Siddharth didn't mince words about his former party. He promised 
to reveal the caste-based elements within the UNP and said that 
he wouldn't spare anyone, not even Ranil Wickremesinghe, the 
President of Sri Lanka and leader of the UNP.
