influenced by these pseudo-intellectuals. I 
actually had an argument with this monk one 
day. I told him, "You can't make such a drastic 
change overnight; it's simply not practical." 
But instead of considering the complexities 
involved, he accused me of being under the 
influence of fertilizer companies, as if I had 
some ulterior motive.
How did you try to counter their 
influence and convince Gotabaya?
I explained to them that all the agricultural 
research conducted over the past 50-60 
years has been based on the use of chemical 
fertilizers. For example, the famous Keeri 
Samba rice variety, a staple in Sri Lanka, 
was developed by our scientists at the Rice 
Research and Development Institute (RRDI) 
in Batalagoda. These Keeri Samba seeds were 
specifically engineered to be highly responsive 
to chemical fertilizers—that's the foundation 
on which they were created. I told him that 
ignoring these facts and expecting to suddenly 
switch to organic methods without serious 
repercussions was a recipe for disaster.
Despite all the facts I presented, the influence 
of this monk and the intellectuals was strong 
enough to sway President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
into making one of the most ill-advised 
decisions of his presidency. It was a decision 
that lacked practical grounding and ultimately 
led to disastrous consequences.
Did you foresee that Gotabaya was 
going to mess everything up?
Well, about halfway through his term, we 
started to realize that things were heading in 
the wrong direction.
Who do you mean by "we"?
Everyone in the party saw it coming. Even 
President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself realized 
that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was on a 
path that could lead to disaster.
How long before Gotabaya fled did you 
sense this?
Probably about a year before he fled, by that 
time, everyone had tried their level best 
to steer him in the right direction. Former 
President Mahinda Rajapaksa, along with 
many others in the party and the government, 
tried to talk sense into him, but he just 
wouldn't listen. That's what I heard from those 
close to him.
Eventually, I took it upon myself to visit the 
eldest Rajapaksa brother, Chamal Rajapaksa, 
at his residence. This was well before 
the Aragalaya protests began. I told him 
plainly that the situation in the country was 
deteriorating rapidly. I said, 'As the eldest in 
the family, it's your duty to gather all your 
brothers together, maybe over dinner at your 
home, and have an honest discussion. Each of 
you needs to tell President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
that the path he's on is not right and that he 
must change course.
And did Chamal Rajapaksa take your 
concerns seriously?
Yes, he did. He also foresaw the disaster 
that was looming. He arranged a dinner at 
his house and got all the brothers together. 
They did discuss the situation with President 
"LTTE and JVP Were Equally Cruel—Two Sides 
of the Same Coin"</p>
