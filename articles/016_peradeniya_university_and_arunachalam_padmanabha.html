Peradeniya 
University and 
Arunachalam 
Padmanabha
By: 
Sarawanan Komathi 
Nadarasa
In the lineage of Kumaraswamy, Sir 
Pon Arunachalam is regarded as a 
progressive historical figure, free from 
accusations of caste, class, or ethnic 
bias. He had eight children: three sons 
and five daughters. The eldest among 
them was Padmanabha. Before 
Arunachalam's demise, Padmanabha 
had already passed away at a young 
age in England.
Padmanabha's death remains a 
mystery to this day. Additionally, 
information about him is extremely 
scarce. Many have grown weary of 
searching for details about him. This 
raises the suspicion that information 
about him and the circumstances of 
his death may have been deliberately 
concealed.
It was only when a Sinhalese 
scholar shared some details 
about him with me that I was 
encouraged to learn more about 
such a personality. According to the 
scholar, Padmanabha spent time 
in England with a woman there. 
Concerned by this, Padmanabha's</p>

father, Ponnambalam Arunachalam, traveled 
to England to bring his son back to Sri Lanka. 
Unfortunately, he found only his son's lifeless 
body, as Padmanabha had allegedly committed 
suicide just before his father's arrival.
Despite many months of effort to verify the 
credibility of this information, my attempts 
have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, I felt 
compelled to record the few important details 
I had uncovered about him. To my knowledge, 
there is no record of Padmanabha in Tamil.
Background of University Formation in 
Sri Lanka
Though the discussion about establishing 
a university in Sri Lanka took place in the 
Legislative Council as early as 1884, this 
dialogue only progressed to the next stage in 
the early 20th century.
In 1906, the Ceylon University Association, 
formed under the leadership of Sir 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam, served as the 
primary foundation for establishing the 
Ceylon University College, a higher education 
institution in Sri Lanka. On January 1, 1921, 
this college was inaugurated at the "Regina 
Walawwa" building on Thurston Road 
(now Kumaratunga Munidasa Mawatha) in 
Colombo. This building was later renamed 
College House. This College House was 
recognized as an institution for higher 
education by the University of London, 
allowing students to pursue external degrees in 
arts, law, and science. The first principal of this 
educational institution was Dr. Robert Marrs.
Significant financial contributions were made 
by individuals such as Sir Pon Ramanathan, 
Sir Pon Arunachalam, Sir John Kotelawala, D. 
R. Wijewardena, and D. S. Senanayake. D. R. 
Wijewardena dedicated one of his own houses, 
named 'Sangavasa', to monks studying at the 
institution.
In 1938, Sir Ivor Jennings became its principal. 
A council called the College Council 
was established to assist the principal in 
administration.
The constitution for the new university was 
developed by Sir Walter Buchanan Riddell, 
who was the chairman of the British University 
Grants Committee and the Ceylon University 
Commission. This constitution was modeled 
after the Hong Kong University constitution 
and was said to resemble the administrative 
models of the universities of Bristol and 
Birmingham in Britain. Although a bill was 
introduced again in the Legislative Council in 
1930 to pursue this effort, its implementation 
was delayed due to World War II and a malaria

epidemic. 1942, Ivor Jennings was sent from 
England to reform Ceylon's constitution 
and educational system. Subsequently, the 
Legislative Council enacted it as University 
Ordinance No. 20 of 1942.
Arrangements were made for the construction 
of the University of Ceylon. In 1928, the 
Legislative Council appointed a committee 
(the University Site Committee) to identify a 
location for establishing the university. The 
Legislative Council agreed that the university 
to be established should be autonomous 
and have residential facilities. Although 
there was a debate on whether to establish 
the university in Colombo or outside of 
Colombo, it was eventually decided to set 
it up outside Colombo. Accordingly, two 
places, "Peradeniya" and "Aruppola" in Kandy, 
were proposed, and it was finally decided to 
establish the university in Peradeniya.
A large tea plantation was being transformed 
into a university. However, there were two 
major reasons why it could not be completed 
on time. The first reason was that the area 
was submerged in a major flood. The second 
reason was the ongoing Second World War.
 Dr.Andreas Neil and Dr. Samuel Chelliah Paul 
prepared and submitted the project plan for 
acquiring land for the university in Peradeniya. 
Initially, 700 acres were acquired, which later 
expanded to 1,700 and eventually increased to 
2,400.
 On July 1, 1942, the Ceylon Medical College 
and the Ceylon University College were 
merged to form the University of Ceylon. 
Arunachalam Hall was established in 1950, 
Jayatilaka Hall, Mars Hall, James Peiris 
Hall, and Hilda Obeyesekere Hall were 
established in 1952, Sangamitta Hall in 1953, 
and Ramanathan Hall in June 1954. Sir Ivor 
Jennings served as its first Vice-Chancellor.
 The University of Ceylon operated in 
Colombo from 1942 to 1950. In 1950, after 
establishing the necessary infrastructure such 
as university buildings, lecture halls, libraries, 
hostels, gymnasiums, sports fields, and other 
facilities, the University of Ceylon officially 
began its operations in Peradeniya in 1952.
 The University of Ceylon, which was relocated 
from Colombo to Peradeniya in 1952, was 
scheduled to be officially opened on October 
6, 1952. However, the official opening was 
postponed due to King George VI of England's 
death. The university was formally inaugurated 
on April 20, 1954, by Queen Elizabeth and the 
Duke of Edinburgh.
 During the opening ceremony at the 
university, the Duke of Edinburgh delivered a 
speech in which he said, "Starting a university 
is not easy. Once started, it must always remain 
open. For example, during the Second World 
War, even when air raids and bombs fell in 
London, shops remained open... Similarly, the 
university must remain open at all times."
 In 1972, following the enactment of the 
University Act No. 1, all universities in Sri 
Lanka were renamed as the University of 
Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the University of 
Ceylon in Peradeniya was maintained as the 
Peradeniya Campus of the University of Sri 
University of Peradeniya</p>

Lanka. Under the University Act No. 16 of 
1978, the universities in Sri Lanka were once 
again established with individual names. Thus, 
from 1979 onwards, it has been named the 
University of Peradeniya and continues to be 
known by this name to the present day.
Timeline:
1942-1952: University of Ceylon
1952-1972: University of Ceylon, Peradeniya
1972-1978: Peradeniya Campus, University of 
Sri Lanka
1978 - present: University of Peradeniya
When discussing the overall design of the 
buildings, lecture halls, hostels, classrooms, 
libraries, gardens, water features, ponds, and 
lakes of the University of Peradeniya, the 
university's first Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Ivor 
Jennings, remarked, "No university in the 
world has such a setting."
The names of those who funded the buildings 
and provided books for the university are 
mentioned in the commemorative book 
published on April 20, 1954, and also in the 
book released for the "University Opening 
Ceremony" in 1992.
The pioneers behind the establishment of this 
university included Supreme Court Judge 
M.T. Akbar, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, 
Sir Marcus Fernando, Sir Baron Jayatilaka, 
Dr. Robert Marrs, Sir James Peiris, Sir 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan, D.S. Senanayake, 
and D.R. Wijewardena.
It is essential to mention another significant 
aspect. The people of the hill country 
substantially contributed the funding for the 
construction of the University of Peradeniya. 
Their labor was the primary source of Sri 
Lanka's revenue. Every cent spent by the Sri 
Lankan government on creating this university 
was derived from the income generated by 
these people.
 Their donations of personal wealth to the 
university reflect the unity and harmony of 
that era, transcending ethnic, religious, and 
class differences. This unity was a testament 
to the ethnic harmony of the time. The 
establishment of the University of Peradeniya 
also marked the end of the era when students 
had to rely on foreign countries for higher 
education.
Padmanabha and William Digby
Among those who petitioned the British 
Crown for the establishment of the University 
of Peradeniya were notable scholars such as 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam, Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan, D. R. Wijewardena, Marcus 
Fernando, James Peiris, and D. B. Jayatilaka.
William Digby</p>

The first collection of books for this library 
was donated by Sir Pon Arunachalam. Sir 
Pon Arunachalam passed away in 1924. His 
eldest son, Padmanabha, had already passed 
away in England in 1921. The collection of 
books from Padmanabha's library was the first 
major donation to the University of Ceylon 
library.1 A total of 1,421 books were donated. 
These fortunate donations laid the foundation 
for what would later become one of the finest 
libraries in Sri Lanka.
The first recorded book from Padmanabha's 
Encyclopedia Britannica collection was 
registered on April 8, 1921.2
From number one to 1,421, these books 
are still available under the "Padmanabha 
Collection" today. The library now operates 
with over 800,000 books.
After Padmanabha, many prominent political 
leaders and scholars of Sri Lanka have donated 
their collections to this library towards the end 
of their lives. These collections are preserved 
under their names.
While we know the year of Arunachalam 
Padmanabha's death, his birth year remains 
unknown. Consequently, we cannot determine 
his age at the time of his death. Some records 
depict him as a student studying in England, 
but the profound reports and books he 
authored suggest he was not as young as these 
records imply.

about_us/history.php,
During the research for this article, an 
important document was found. In the June 
1908 issue of the Ceylon National Review 
(no.6), Padmanabha authored an extensive 
article titled "Reform of the Ceylon Legislative 
Council." He also provided a detailed 
introduction to William Digby's article, "An 
Oriental Colony Ripe for Self-Government," 
which discusses the necessary political reforms 
for Ceylon. Notably, William Digby had passed 
away in 1904.3
The article spanned 31 pages and was 
published as a small book in the same year.4 It 
was also released as a pamphlet, as indicated 
by Padmanabha's writing.5 Padmanabha 
published this article as a pamphlet in 
1904, the same year William Digby died. In 
his recommendations, Digby emphasized 
the importance of Tamil representation in 
Colombo. He argued that five representatives 
should be allocated to the Legislative Council 
for Europeans, Burghers, Tamils, Sinhalese, 
and Muslims/Malay communities.
Forty years later, in 1919, when the Ceylon 
National Congress was established, Sir Pon 
3. William Digby was not only a famous journalist but 
also a radical social reformer. He was a vocal critic 
of colonial methods in India and Sri Lanka and an 
advocate for Indian workers at that time. He served 
as an associate editor of the Ceylon Observer in Sri 
Lanka and wrote for The Madras Times in Madras. He 
was also the editor-in-chief of the magazine. Sir Pon 
Arunachalam was his close friend, and this friend-
ship likely brought him closer to Arunachalam's son, 
Padmanabha. During his involvement in the the Tem-
perance Movement, William Digby, along with Ram-
anathan and Arunachalam, actively led the movement 
against the paddy tax.

Arunachalam endorsed the same demand for 
Tamil representation. You might know that 
he was later disappointed and subsequently 
left the Ceylon National Congress. Notably, 
Digby had proposed this demand as early as 
1877, and by 1908, Padmanabha was actively 
supporting this cause.
During his time in England, Padmanabha was 
encouraged by his father, Arunachalam, to 
meet with Lord Milner, the then Secretary of 
State for the Colonies, to discuss the political 
reform situation in Sri Lanka.6, 7
This article's detailed political reform 
recommendations confirm that Padmanabha 
was deeply engaged in Sri Lankan politics 
and possessed profound political thinking. 
Unfortunately, gathering more information 
about Padmanabha's political role and 
involvement has been challenging.
Within the Gate Mudaliyar A. Coomaraswamy 
family, five members served in the 
Legislative Council. These include his son-
in-law Edirimanasinghe Mudaliyar, his 
son Sir Coomaraswamy, and his grandsons 
Ponnambalam Ramanathan Coomaraswamy, 
Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy, and 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam Coomaraswamy. 
Following in their footsteps, it is evident that 
Padmanabha also had significant social and 
political involvement.
University of Peradeniya Library
In Sri Lanka, the Printing and Publications 
Act, introduced in 1886, was amended in 
1952. According to this amendment, four 
copies of every publication issued in Sri 
6. M.Vythilingam, Ramanathan of Ceylon, The Life of 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Vol II, 1977.
7. H.A.J.Hulugale, The life and Times of 
D.R.Wijewardene, Lake House, Colombo, 1960
Lanka must be submitted to the Department 
of National Archives. One of these copies is 
kept at the National Library, another at the 
National Museum, the third at the Peradeniya 
University Library, and the fourth at the 
Ruhuna University Library. Unfortunately, 
today, many do not adhere to this law. As a 
result, there is a risk of losing the opportunity 
to preserve books and journals published in Sri 
Lanka nationally.
During my discussions with the librarians at 
the University of Peradeniya Library when 
I donated my books to the library, they 
expressed concern about this issue.
It is also important to note that the history 
of this library predates the history of the 
University of Peradeniya itself.
Today, the Chief Librarian of the University 
of Peradeniya Library is a Tamil scholar, Dr. 
Maheswaran, who is an excellent librarian. 
This library houses very rare and unique 
ancient palm-leaf manuscripts of Sri Lanka. It 
is the repository of the complete old original 
palm-leaf manuscript of the Mahavamsa. After 
the Mahavamsa manuscripts were declared 
a World Heritage in June, these palm-leaf 
manuscripts were placed in iron boxes and are 
now preserved in a special room with military 
security, as I learned during my visit there.
Unfortunately, I noticed that only about three 
percent of the books and documents in this 
library are in Tamil. This situation is not 
unique to this library alone but extends to 
other major institutions in Sri Lanka regarded 
as national archival organizations, such as the 
National Archives, the Colombo Museum 
Library, and the National Library, among 
others.</p>

epuhfuzk;) from the 1964 collection of 
short stories titled akkā (mf;fh) by 
A. Muttulingam
Translated by:

(vOj;Jf;fpdpatd;)
Nadēsan is one of those 
Colombo dwellers who eagerly 
yearn for: “when will the next 
long weekend come around, so 
that I can make a quick trip to 
Jaffna.” He was standing on the 
border line of the horrendous 
grief called separation. Never 
before had he experienced such 
pain.
He did write letters. But 
were they mere letters? They 
were repositories of his tears; 
throbbing of his heart.
But for how long can 
declarations of love in letters 
Resolution 
and 
Refutation</p>

keep his wife content?
‘She is just a naive child; What did 
she gain by getting married? Our 
half-baked interactions were like a 
puppet show of shadows; when did 
we have a chance for a heart-to-heart 
conversation?’
How did she, who would stand shyly 
in front of him, biting into her plaits, 
learn to write this way?
‘I have never seen your face fully; 
I have heard that dimples form on 
your cheeks when you laugh, I have 
never got to experience even that; 
Still …’
‘I am your wife, publicly betrothed 
to you as your own. Shyness 
overcomes me when I think of it …’
Every word was like a red-hot spear 
piercing his heart.
So, what, it is just his luck!
Luck manifests to different people in 
many different forms. But his luck!
The day after the wedding, he left 
on what they so eloquently call in 
English, “the honeymoon.”
But the day they set foot in 
Colombo, it wasn’t the usual city 
of Colombo. There were riots 
everywhere; hatred; ethnic hatred.
People were beating and killing 
other people. The streets of the great 
city of Colombo were drenched 
in blood, as though Mother Earth, 
unable to tolerate this outrage, shed 
tears herself.
The rough ground lay below. The broad canopy of the 
sky rose above. A heavy police cordon prevented any 
unauthorized entry.
It was teeming with humanity. He and she spent that 
fabled “first night” amidst this sea of humanity.  A 
mind-piercing look emerged from the depths of his 
heart.
The single tear droplet that struggled to emerge ended 
up dissolving all her heart’s dreams.
For ten days, they suffered as refugees amidst the sea 
of refugees.
When they finally left for Jaffna by a refugee ship, he 
with a stubble, and she with her hair in a mess, love 
was the last thing in their minds.
When they set foot in their village, overcome with 
embarrassment, an emergency telegram arrived, 
summoning him back to work.
Back to the city of Colombo!</p>

Kamali didn’t even notice that it got dark. 
Nadēsan’s letter w lay sprawled on her chest.
Everything she saw, everything she 
sees, seems to her like reflections and 
reverberations of grief.
Her heart pained as though it had lost 
everything. Through it she felt the anguish of 
having lost some nameless bliss.
‘Is everything Vimalā said true?!’
‘Chee …. Perhaps this is how everyone says it 
out aloud!’
“Kamali! Tell me the truth. Can’t you really 
tell your husband apart just by the sound of 
his footsteps?”
‘Vimalā isn’t a fool like me; I am ‘married’ 
only in name.’
‘Look at her! How old is she? When I started 
wearing a sari, she hadn’t even graduated to 
wearing a long skirt.’
‘It seems his big toe is enough for her to 
identify him. Apparently, she knows the 
warmth of his breath… is it not just the 
breath? … Che… if she was still asleep, he 
apparently doesn’t wake her up by touching 
her, but … bends over … on the lips, …. ch-
chee… …’
‘What would she have thought of me – what 
else – she would have pitied me.’</p>
<hr />
<p>One could still hear the sound of Pālaṉ’s 
sobbing. It was already dark. Kamali lit a 
lamp and placed it on the table.
“Lift your head Pālaṉ; enough crying; it is a 
kerosene lamp, if you knock it over, that’s it.”
“No, I won’t. I will stay like this!” His parents 
had not taken him along to the wedding but 
left him behind to keep Kamali company. His</p>

anger has not entirely subsided.
Kamali lifted the kudam to her hip and started 
towards the well. Like the soft blanketing of 
dusk, a darkness was filling her heart. The 
crack from a nameless sorrow was slowly 
pervading the depths of her heart.
She heard the sound of someone taking a bath.
Kamali was startled.
“Who is there?”
“It is just me.”
“Is it you Rāsaṉ?” she called out, in a voice 
palpable with relief.
“Why akkā, were you scared?” He 
guffawed. <br />
“No, I thought it was some stranger …”
“Give me a couple of buckets of water, thambi 
… … …”
‘I was scared of Rāsaṉ! He was just wee high 
before … …’
‘Perhaps boys grow up fast!’
“Why Rāsaṉ, did your ammā and everyone 
else go to the wedding?”
“They? They went already earlier.”
“So no one else is at home!”
“No akkā, it is just me!”
When she bent down to lift the kudam up, her 
thāvaṇi slipped. 
She hurriedly gathered it up and draped it 
back over her shoulder. In the dull moonlight, 
her instincts told her that he was looking at 
her intently. She was pleased.
When she lifted her head, she was taken 
aback. His stunned look with hair dripping 
with water, his forelocks covering the 
forehead – reminded her of something.</p>

‘He … he is like this, too…’
The second time she came to the well, her 
heart was pounding, thinking ‘would Rāsaṉ 
have left by now?’
‘How old is Rāsaṉ now? Sixteen?’
‘He sat for his Senior Secondary School 
examinations already last year!’
Rāsaṉ was lathering soap on.
“Why Rāsaṉ! So, are you the one guarding the 
house?”
“Yes akkā, exams are approaching; I have to 
stay home to study… …”
For some reason, a little smile crossed his 
lips.
The dimple on his cheek. His cute dimple.
‘Those cheeks – those hairless silky cheeks’ – 
she wanted to regard them till eternity.
The moon rays that reflected off those dimples 
reached out and shyly touched her breasts that 
were heaving with no reason.
She jolted herself out of her reverie and 
grabbed the rope tied to the well sweep.
“You want water! I will draw it for you akkā.”
“No thambi, you dry yourself first.”
“It is ok. You shouldn’t be drawing water 
when it is this dark.”
A strange feeling came over Kamali. She 
wanted to fondly call out “Rāsaṉ!” to her 
heart’s content.
He grabbed the bucket from her. In doing so, 
his soapy hands gently touched her slender 
arms.
Kamali’s heart bubbled over its rims. A new 
feeling.</p>

When Rāsaṉ drew water, his hands trembled 
for some reason.
3
When she started towards the well, carrying a 
kudam, for the third time it did not look like 
she was doing it of her own free will. It was 
as though she was possessed by a demon that 
was urging her forward.
‘Why, why?’
‘I want to see him smile, just one more time’. 
The desire grew large and enveloped her 
entire mindscape. Afraid of a change of heart, 
she hurried towards the well.
Rāsaṉ stood there towelling his hair.
“Do you need more water?” – his voice was 
hoarse for some reason.
“Just one more kudam” – the response came 
from somewhere deep within.
“A… k… kā” – he blurted out, unsteady on 
his feet.
Kamali was silent. She stood staring at him.
“You… you … … will not tell ammā, will 
you?”
What came over her?
She stood transfixed like a statue.
A displaced star in the sky was falling.
When she lifted the empty kudam to her hips 
and walked away, it weighed a tonne. 
Inside the house, Pālaṉ’s sobbing could still 
be heard.
4
Her life inched forward in a “dream state” so 
to speak. Sometimes it looked like Kamali 
understood her situation, sometimes it didn’t. 
Whenever she was alone, she steeled her 
heart. But …</p>

There was a pulsation, an eagerness, again 
and again kept pushing her into the abyss of 
sin.
Kamali was just a walking corpse.
Sometimes the letter from her husband melted 
her heart. She felt like running to his feet to 
bawl her heart out; on those days, she was 
resolute.
But when the sun set and it was time to light 
the evening lamp, the crystal-clear sound of 
Rāsaṉ’s bicycle bell as he turned the corner at 
the junction would completely shatter all her 
resolve within a second.
5
Kamali was holding a kokkaththadi in her 
hand. The moringa tree had exceptionally 
borne a fruit. She jumped up aiming for the 
lone fruit.
She knew that her husband loved it. She will 
cook it for him today.
Nadēsan stood relishing this scene. He cannot 
see such a scene tomorrow since his time off 
from work was ending that day.
He felt a discomfort in the depths of his heart. 
‘Kamali – my darling Kamali – should I be 
separated from her again?’
Her tired face, laced with beads of sweat, was 
exquisite.
“Kamali” he called out with great fondness as 
he turned her warm cheek towards him.
“Ich. People are looking” she said shyly.
The two people who sat on top of the passing 
cadjan bullock cart enjoyed the privilege of 
their vantage point a little too excessively.
6
He prepared to leave.
She was left with the feeling that the entire 
world had come to a standstill.
She understood every strand of his breath, 
every reverberation of his heart. It is only 
now that she understood the full meaning of 
separation.
Nadēsan took her left hand. She felt a burning 
sensation.
It was the same hand that Rāsaṉ’s unsteady 
soapy hands touched.
“Chee” – she cast away those impure 
thoughts. But they rose up again, in a gigantic 
form, to torture her.
Kamali cried her heart out, thinking of 
something.
Tears flowed out of Nadēsan’s eyes, too.
“Why are you crying?” She sobbed, wiping 
his tears with her tiny fingers.
“Because you are crying!” 
“When will you return, aththaan”
Silence was the response.
Kamali’s two warm streams of grief mingled 
with his quivering lips.
Unconsciously a resolution was forming in 
her heart.
7
It was a Sunday. There were no other friends 
in the boarding house. Everyone had gone off 
to see a movie. Nadēsan sat down with relief</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

to write a letter for Kamali.
“Kamali! If I could grow wings this instant, 
would I not fly to you right away? Will I 
not admire every little detail of your walk, 
the way you decorate yourself, your voice, 
that little mischievous smile that curls in the 
corners of your lips?
“My darling, as I write this letter, you will be 
standing beneath the familiar jasmine bush; 
your thoughts wander. All those thoughts …
On the same day, at the same time as Nadēsan 
was writing this letter, many miles away —
Kamali’s father was coaxing the ‘white 
lagoon’ chickens he had just brought from 
Colombo to climb up the tree.
Inside, his wife was cleaning the soot covered 
hurricane lamp.
Pālaṉ held his book wide open and was 
alternating between reciting the Vipulāṉanthar 
poem in a voice with a loudness that was 
uncalled for, and lifting his head to watch his 
sister:</p>
<p>“uḷḷak kamalamaṯi kiḷiyē   <br />
[It is the flower of your heart, parrot]</p>
<p>uttamaṉār vēṇṯuvatu”
[ that the lord asks for]
Kamali was chopping green plantains for 
dinner.
She wasn’t paying attention to anything, not 
even to chopping green plantains.
A darkness engulfed her heart, weighing 
heavily!
At a distance, Rāsaṉ’s bicycle bell needlessly 
rang twice, as he turned around the bend by 
the tamarind tree.
It echoed on Kamali’s bleeding fingers!</p>
