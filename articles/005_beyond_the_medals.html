D
r. Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam, the pioneering athlete 
who secured Ceylon's first gold medal at the 1958 Asian 
Games in Tokyo, died at 89 in Los Angeles, USA. Born in a 
modest dwelling in Periyavillan on the Jaffna Peninsula, his 
ascent to global recognition stands as a powerful testament to 
the resilience and indomitable spirit of the Sri Lankan Tamil 
community. His legacy transcends his athletic achievements,

symbolizing a community's perseverance and 
steadfast resolve in challenging circumstances.
Born in 1934, Ethir, as he was affectionately 
known, overcame significant odds. His 
humble beginnings in a one-room hut did 
not deter him from setting his sights high—
quite literally. Self-taught from pictures in 
an athletics book, he made a vow at a young 
age while watching the 1948 Olympics to one 
day compete on the world stage. His dreams 
materialized sooner than expected when 
he represented Ceylon at the 1952 Helsinki 
Olympics at merely 17 years old, a prelude to a 
storied athletic career.
Ethir's gold medal victory at the 1958 Tokyo 
Asian Games was not merely a personal 
achievement but a historic milestone for 
Ceylon. This triumph coincided with a period 
of severe unrest back home, as his homeland 
was embroiled in the 1958 anti-Tamil riots—a 
turmoil Ethir was unaware of until his return. 
He famously remarked in an interview that 
while he, a member of the Sri Lankan Tamil 
ethnic minority, was winning a gold medal 
for the country, the majority of that same 
nation was perpetrating violence against its 
own people. This stark contrast between his 
sporting success and the senseless violence at 
home profoundly affected him, shaping his 
subsequent endeavours in conflict resolution 
and community rebuilding.

At the 1962 Jakarta Asian Games, Dr 
Ethirveerasingam secured the silver medal, 
further cementing his status as a distinguished 
athlete. Previously, at the 1954 Manila Asian 
Games, he achieved a remarkable feat by 
jumping the same height of 1.95 meters as 
the gold, silver, and bronze medalists. Despite 
this accomplishment, he was placed fourth 
due to having more misses than the other 
competitors.
Ethir's achievements on the track were 
paralleled by his academic pursuits. After 
transferring to St. Joseph's College in Colombo 
to be closer to his coach, he won a scholarship 
to the University of California, Los Angeles 
(UCLA), where he later earned a master's 
degree and a PhD. His educational background 
led him to roles far beyond the track, teaching 
and conducting research in Sierra Leone, 
Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea.
Despite his global recognition, Dr. 
Ethirveerasingam's connection to his 
homeland remained unwaveringly strong. 
In 1994, as many Sri Lankan Tamils were 
fleeing the escalating conflict—often at great 
risk and significant expense—he resolutely 
chose to return. At the age of 60, he went 
back to lend his expertise at the University 
of Jaffna during the peak of the civil war. His 
involvement extended far beyond academic 
responsibilities; he dedicated himself to 
volunteering in devastated regions, making 
significant contributions to educational, 
sports, and humanitarian projects. Beyond 
these endeavours, his most defining role 
emerged as a peacemaker and educator. His 
mediation efforts during the Sri Lankan civil 
war and his passionate advocacy for peace and

reconciliation earned him 
widespread respect across 
all factions of the conflict.
In 1998, a significant 
honour was extended 
to Dr Nagalingam 
Ethirveerasingam by 
Sri Lankan President 
Chandrika Kumaratunga 
Bandaranaike, who offered 
him the prestigious 
'Deshabandu.' However, 
he declined the honour 
in a profound display of 
solidarity and principle. 
In his letter to President 
Bandaranaike, he 
expressed his reasons, 
stating, "I cannot in good 
conscience accept such a 
title when my people are 
suffering and the war is 
continuing." This decision 
underscored his deep 
commitment to being 
part of his brethren's 
struggle, emphasizing his 
unwavering dedication to 
the well-being and justice 
of his community during a 
conflict.
Ethir's life was marked by 
significant challenges. His candid 
discussions about the racial 
discrimination he faced, even as a 
celebrated athlete, illuminate the 
complexities of his experiences. 
He once disclosed that, despite 
qualifying, he was initially not 
selected for the Asian Games, a 
decision he attributed to systemic 
discrimination by the then Sri 
Lankan government. He managed 
to overcome this obstacle through 
his unwavering resilience and with 
the support of his community, 
media advocates, and many kind-
hearted Sinhalese individuals who 
rallied behind him.
Survived by his wife, three children, 
and eight grandchildren, Dr. 
Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam's 
story transcends that of a mere 
sportsman to embody a beacon 
of hope. His legacy is a powerful 
testament to the transformative 
impact of sports and education, 
demonstrating how one can 
rise above societal and personal 
challenges to forge a path of 
individual success and societal 
betterment. His determination, 
educational pursuits, and deep 
commitment to his roots have 
crafted a legacy that will endure for 
generations.
At the Jaffna Monitor, we join 
the many who are mourning his 
passing, remembering him not only 
for his monumental achievements 
but for the indelible mark he left on 
our hearts and our history.

the Asian Games in Tokyo, completely unaware of the pogrom unfolding 
back on the island.</p>
