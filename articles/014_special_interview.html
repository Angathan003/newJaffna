special interview
“We’ve Funded Temples. We’ve 
Funded Bullets. Maybe It’s Time 
We Fund  Trauma Centres and 
Teacher Salaries”:
BY: 
Our Special Correspondent
Abbi Kanthasamy Speaks to Jaffna Monitor
W
hen entrepreneur and strategist Abbi 
Kanthasamy published his deeply 
personal essay, “A Beacon Amidst the 
Bleeding: What Jaffna’s Doctors Taught Me 
About Life,” he may not have anticipated 
the resonance it would spark. Yet within 
hours, the piece went viral across social 
media — striking a nerve in a nation 
numbed by crisis. </p>
<p>Born in Jaffna to a Director of Education 
father and a university lecturer mother, 
Abbi spent much of his early life in the 
North. Today, he is a dynamic figure in 
global business circles: an entrepreneur, 
restaurateur, writer, and photographer, with 
ventures spanning from Malaysia to North 
America.</p>
<p><img alt="p062_i1.jpg" src="assets/images/014_special_interview/p062_i1.jpg" /></p>

Though widely known as “Abbi,” his given 
name is Abethan — a name bestowed by the 
legendary Tamil scholar and journalist K. 
Kailasapathy. Abethan, meaning "one who 
does not discriminate," would prove quietly 
prophetic for someone who would later bridge 
cultures through cuisine, commerce, and 
creativity. </p>
<p>He is internationally recognized as the 
founder of Nadodi and Aliyaa, the first Sri 
Lankan cuisine-inspired restaurants to receive 
Michelin recognition. His flagship venture, 
Nadodi, operates within the prestigious Four 
Seasons Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, delivering 
an award-winning fine-dining experience 
that seamlessly fuses Jaffna, South Indian, 
Sri Lankan, and Western culinary traditions. 
The restaurant's signature tasting menu offers 
a sophisticated reinterpretation of ancestral 
flavors for the contemporary palate. </p>
<p>His diverse business ventures extend beyond 
culinary excellence to include The Sticky 
Wicket sports bar — a vibrant social hub 
where entertainment and hospitality converge. </p>
<p>He has also established a flourishing North 
American furniture distribution enterprise, 
specializing in premium upholstered products 
under an internationally acclaimed brand. This 
sophisticated operation spans the continent 
with its Toronto headquarters anchoring 
showrooms in the entertainment capital of 
Las Vegas and the commercial nexus of North 
Carolina. </p>
<p>Yet his artistic vision transcends the corporate 
milieu. His evocative photography—replete 
with texture and emotional gravitas—
transforms his restaurant spaces into 
immersive galleries. </p>
<p>In this compelling discourse with Jaffna 
Monitor, Abbi elucidates the deeply personal 
motivations behind his literary endeavors, 
shares his perspicacious observations about 
the unexpected efficacy within public 
health systems, and delivers a provocative 
exhortation to the Tamil diaspora, advocating 
for a paradigmatic transformation in how 
the community approaches its philanthropic 
allocations.
What inspired you to pen “A Beacon 
Amidst the Bleeding,” and how has 
the public’s reaction influenced your 
perspective on Sri Lanka’s healthcare 
system?
It wasn’t planned. I was raw—emotionally 
and personally—watching my mother 
survive a near-fatal heart attack in the 
north. What moved me most wasn’t just the 
medical care; it was the quiet defiance of 
those who gave it. The doctors and nurses in 
Mullaitivu and Jaffna worked without drama, 
without complaint—just calm, unwavering 
professionalism. Writing was the only way 
I knew how to thank them. The public’s 
response has only reinforced my reverence for 
those who stay and serve, even when the world 
tells them to leave.
You vividly describe the dedication 
and selflessness of the Jaffna and 
Mullaitivu healthcare professionals. 
What specific actions or interactions 
truly left the deepest impression on 
you?
A young doctor—barely 30—coordinated 
my mother’s transfer between districts like a 
general in a warzone: no ego, no theatrics, just 
unwavering focus. The nurses and orderlies 
moved with a rhythm of quiet competence.</p>

None of it was a one-off. It was systemic 
excellence amid scarcity.
The article has gone viral in Sri 
Lanka. What has been your 
reaction to this overwhelming 
response, particularly from within 
Sri Lanka? Were you surprised 
by its impact?
Floored. I wrote it in a single 
sitting, unedited, unsanitized. 
Actually while on a drive from 
Mullativu to Jaffna. I didn’t expect 
it to land the way it did. But maybe 
that’s what people needed—truth 
without spin. The response reminded 
me that even in a fractured world, 
there’s still a hunger for dignity, 
not just outrage. Someone even 
unearthed an essay I wrote when I 
was 13 at Jaffna Hindu College—
about the Titanic, written when 
they found the wreck. I’ve been 
fascinated with storytelling ever 
since. Back then, I couldn’t afford a 
camera. The ads for Nikon F-series 
cameras in the back of National 
Geographic haunted me. Today, 
I have all the gear I dreamed of. 
But the heart of photography—
and writing—is the same: it’s 
about choosing what to include, 
what to blur, what to sharpen. 
Storytelling is curation. And I 
hope the next generation picks up 
their phones and starts framing 
their own truths.
You draw a powerful 
contrast between the 
healthcare systems of 
Canada and northern Sri Lanka. What 
do you see as the core strengths of 
Sri Lanka’s public healthcare-
particularly in emergency care-
that are often overlooked?
Efficiency born of necessity. In 
the north, there’s no time for 
bureaucratic red tape. Decisions 
are made fast, lives are 
prioritized over paperwork. 
Global perceptions often 
assume that brilliance 
needs budget. But 
what I witnessed 
was something else 
entirely: care powered by 
purpose, not privilege.
You mention the exodus of 
doctors from Sri Lanka. 
What measures do you 
believe could encourage 
medical professionals to 
remain and serve in the 
country?
Respect. Recognition. Real working 
conditions. It’s not just about 
salaries—though those matter—it’s 
about being seen and supported. 
Housing, scholarships, and 
professional development all play a 
role, but ultimately, the government 
must lead with vision. And let’s not 
limit the conversation to doctors. 
Teachers, lecturers, counsellors—
they’re all bleeding out of the 
system. We either invest in 
them now or pay the price for 
generations to come.</p>

Your father, Mr. 
Kanthasamy, who served 
as a Director of Education 
in Jaffna, and your 
mother, Mrs. Parvathy 
Kanthasamy—a former 
lecturer at the University 
of Jaffna and now a 
social worker and activist 
in Canada—have both 
been influential figures 
in education and social 
activism. How have their 
values and life experiences 
shaped your own path and 
worldview?
They taught me that success 
without service is hollow—and 
that the most meaningful lives 
are built quietly, with conviction.
My father, Mr. Kanthasamy, 
served as Director of Education 
for Sri Lanka’s North and East 
during some of the region’s 
most fragile years. He wasn’t 
just running schools—he 
was preserving the future for 
communities under siege, 
making sure that even in the 
darkest moments, children had 
a reason to hope. His leadership 
was quiet, firm, and deeply 
rooted in principle.
My mother, Dr. Parvathy, was 
a linguistics lecturer at the 
University of Jaffna. She later 
won a senior Fulbright scholarship, did postdoctoral 
research, and taught at Stanford University. While she 
was at Stanford, I completed high school in Palo Alto, 
then went on to earn my engineering degree at McGill 
University in Canada. But no academic institution ever 
taught me what I learned the day we lost our home.
I still remember standing in Kantharmadam, watching 
our only house burn—set ablaze by the military, right 
before our eyes. I was just a nine year old boy. And in 
the middle of that inferno, my mother turned to me and 
said: “They can burn our house, but they can’t burn your 
mom’s PhD.”
Perhaps the best lesson I’ve ever had.
That moment, more than any classroom, taught me 
what resilience truly looks like. My parents gave without 
applause. They endured without bitterness. They showed 
me that dignity isn’t inherited—it’s practiced. That 
service, not success, is the highest calling. And that even 
when everything is taken from you, no one can touch 
what you’ve built inside.
How do you navigate and integrate your Sri 
Lankan heritage within your global business 
ventures?
I don’t compartmentalize it—I weave it in. Whether I’m 
designing a piece of furniture or building a restaurant 
brand, there’s always a thread back to Jaffna. Culture isn’t 
a museum piece. It’s a remix—heritage in motion.
Given that Nadodi offers a unique fusion of Sri 
Lankan and Indian culinary traditions, what 
inspired this blend, and how do you ensure the 
soul of both cuisines is preserved?
It wasn’t about novelty. It was about movement—
people crossing borders, bringing recipes, losing 
homes but keeping spices. Our chefs don’t just cook. 
They investigate. They sit with elders, document oral 
histories, and travel into the Vanni. That’s how we ensure</p>

authenticity lives inside the innovation. Today, 
Nadodi operates out of the Four Seasons in 
KL. Seeing our name on that elevator button—
it was personal. It meant our story mattered.
How do you envision the evolution of 
Sri Lankan cuisine and culture on the 
global stage, and what role do you 
hope to play in that journey?
We’re just getting started. There’s such regional 
complexity, so much soul. If I can be the guy 
holding the flashlight while others take the 
stage—great. Let the world see what we’ve 
known all along: our food, our rhythm, our 
people—they’re world-class.
Holding 42 U.S. design patents is a 
remarkable achievement. Can you 
share insights into your creative 
process and what fuels your 
innovation?
I look for friction—what annoys people, what 
doesn’t work. Then I sketch, test, destroy, 
rebuild. I treat design like storytelling: rooted 
in empathy. Most of my patents are design 
patents—meant to protect form and deter 
copycats. But here’s the truth: patents aren’t 
cheap. They only matter if you can defend 
them. So you’d better love what you’re 
protecting. I do.
Your photography spans everything 
from street cricket in Sri Lanka to 
culinary artistry. What stories are you 
most passionate about telling, and 
how does photography fit into your 
broader creative life?
Edges. That’s where my lens goes—where 
tradition meets change, where beauty rots and 
reinvents itself. Photography slows me down. 
It teaches me to see. It’s the same instinct I 
apply in business and writing. All three are 
about framing something invisible. My site- 
www.abbiphotography.com—shows that 
I’ve always valued narrative over technical 
perfection. But I learned the old-school way: 
film, darkrooms, fixer chemicals. I still have a 
darkroom. I shoot black and white. And I’m 
trying to get my son Cheran hooked on it. To 
me, monochrome is still the purest form.
What role do you believe the Sri 
Lankan diaspora can play in the 
country’s development, particularly in 
sectors like healthcare and education?
We’ve funded temples. We’ve funded bullets. 
Maybe now it’s time we fund trauma centres 
and teacher salaries. The diaspora has the 
intellect, the networks, the capital. What 
we lack is coordination—and sometimes, 
compassion in the right direction. An NGO 
once told me that in Jaffna, you can raise 
RM200,000 for a temple festival, but struggle 
to get RM10,000 for disabled children. That 
has to change. It’s not a money problem. It’s a 
priority problem.
What advice would you offer to 
aspiring entrepreneurs and creatives 
who want to make a meaningful 
impact in their communities?
Start ugly. Start now. Don’t wait for perfect. 
Solve one small problem with big heart. And 
if you mess up—mess up with volume. That’s 
where the stories live. I’m still learning. That’s 
the point.</p>

n Eelam Tamil politics, few words have 
caused as much damage—or claimed as 
many lives—as the word “traitor.” And it 
was S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, founder of the 
Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (Federal Party) 
in 1949, who first slipped this venom into the 
bloodstream of Tamil political discourse.
Until then, the Tamil Congress and its leader 
G.G. Ponnambalam had struggled to make 
inroads in the East. They remained a northern 
force—Jaffna-centric, both in character and 
reach.
In the East, the man of the moment was V. 
Nalliah Master—a respected leader who served 
as Deputy Minister for education, health, and 
postal services. But to plant the Federal Party’s 
flag in the East, Chelvanayakam launched 
a smear campaign, branding Nalliah as a 
“kaikkooli” (a political stooge)—someone 
blindly loyal to the Sinhalese-led government.
Stage by stage, rally by rally, the insult echoed 
across the East. And only after bringing 
Nalliah master down did the Federal Party 
finally step into the region.
Years later, Chelvanayakam’s political heir A. 
Amirthalingam would refine the rhetoric. 
“Kaikkooli” wasn’t sharp enough. He needed a 
word with blood on its edge. And so, “traitor” 
entered the lexicon—with Alfred Duraiappah,

That S.J.V. Chelvanayakam Opened

Amirthalingam’s rival in Jaffna, as its first 
public victim. That word became a bullet—
fired by a young Velupillai Prabhakaran, barely 
in his twenties.
What began as a slur soon evolved into an 
ideology. Prabhakaran used the label “traitor” 
not merely to justify assassinations, but 
to silence dissent, dismantle rival militant 
movements, and consolidate Tamil nationalist 
power under the LTTE. In a grim twist of 
fate, he would eventually turn the gun on 
Amirthalingam himself—the very man who 
first taught him to see Duraiappah as a traitor.
Thus was born a politics of moral absolutism—
where to disagree was to betray, and to betray 
was to die.
No one has worn the label “traitor” more often 
than Douglas Devananda. For decades, Tamil 
nationalist media hurled the word at him with 
unrelenting force. Yet, for all the LTTE’s reach 
and firepower, they never managed to silence 
“traitor Douglas.” Nor could they ever claim 
the satisfaction of having done so.
And now, history turns a curious corner.
The party that first unleashed this rhetoric—
the Federal Party—must now be the one to 
bury it. And the man leading that quiet burial 
is none other than C.V.K. Sivagnanam, Acting 
Leader of the party and once a trusted figure 
in the eyes of Prabhakaran himself.
By walking into Douglas Devananda’s office in 
Jaffna-by asking for his support to form local 
government bodies-Sivagnanam did more 
than strike a political deal. He challenged 
a legacy. He stepped into the shadow of 
Chelvanayakam and began the long, painful 
work of undoing the curse his party had cast.
What Chelvanayakam began, Sivagnanam 
is now trying to end. In doing so, in his own 
quiet way, he is seeking to wash away the 
sins of his party, the legacy of his political 
ancestors, and the bloodstains they left behind.
Destiny, it seems, has its own strange rhythm.
