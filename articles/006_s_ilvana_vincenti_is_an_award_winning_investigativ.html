S
ilvana Vincenti is an award-winning 
investigative journalist, widely renowned 
in Bolivia for her fearless and impactful 
reporting. An alumna of Gabriel René Moreno 
University (UAGRM) in Santa Cruz, she 
brings over 13 years of experience with Grupo 
Multimedia El Deber, one of the country’s 
most respected newspapers. Through her 
work at El Deber, she has built a formidable 
reputation for incisive investigations into 
environmental degradation, Indigenous rights, 
land encroachments, human trafficking, 
and systemic abuses linked to powerful land 
mafias.
A specialist in exposing the complex interplay 
between ecological crises and socio-political 
injustice, Vincenti’s journalism reflects 
an unflinching commitment to truth, 
accountability, and the defense of marginalized 
communities.
She clinched first place in the Conservation 
International (CI) Nature Reporting Award 
and was a key member of the Amazon 
Underworld investigative team, which received 
the prestigious 2024 Gabriel García Márquez 
Award in the Coverage category. Over the 
years, she has solidified her status as one of 
Latin America’s most tenacious and principled 
voices in journalism.
This is her first exclusive interview with an 
Asian publication.
What initially sparked your interest in 
investigating the activities of 'Kailasa' 
in Bolivia? Was there a specific tip-off 
or event that led you down this path?
The initial information came to me through 
an indigenous organization that discovered 
negotiations between Kailasa and leaders of 
three Amazonian indigenous nations. They 
provided me with contracts that included a 
1,000-year, automatically renewable land lease, 
along with other completely irrational clauses.
Could you explain how you discovered 
the presence of Kailasa agents 
in Bolivia? What made you think 
something was wrong?
After analyzing the documents and confirming 
their authenticity with the Indigenous people 
who had signed those contracts, I obtained 
the phone numbers of the representatives of 
Kailasa in Bolivia and contacted them. I sent 
them questions, but they did not respond. 
They only reached out to me once the matter 
had already been published. The day after the 
publication, they showed up at my office trying 
to persuade me that their intentions were 
good.
I realized something was wrong from the 
very first time I read the contracts—they were 
completely illegal because they disguised the 
sale of land using the word "lease." And this 
use of land is illegal in Bolivia; it's considered 
land trafficking.
Based on your investigation, what 
do you believe was Kailasa’s true 
objective behind these thousand-
year land lease agreements? Were 
they genuinely trying to establish an 
independent nation within Bolivian 
territory, or was their main goal 
to exploit the natural resources 
and strategic value of the Amazon 
under the pretext of spiritual and 
environmental cooperation?</p>

From what I’ve investigated, Kailasa’s demand 
for such a vast amount of land didn’t make 
much sense—especially given that the area 
was sparsely populated. Only three people 
were living on the half a million hectares that 
were negotiated. Kailasa had already signed 
contracts as early as August last year, meaning 
that six months passed between the signing 
of the agreements and the public revelation of 
the matter.
All this leads me to suspect that Kailasa’s true 
intention was to secure territory in order 
to function like a sovereign state within 
another sovereign state. And behind them, I 
believe there are powerful figures in Bolivia 
who are interested in the resources within 
these lands—resources that cannot legally 
be exploited—using Kailasa as a cover. For 
instance, at the time Kailasa signed the 
agreements, Bolivia was changing its policies 
regarding carbon markets, allowing it to enter 
that space. In a bankrupt country currently 
dependent on international loans, this could 
seem like an attractive economic alternative.
I believe someone saw Kailasa’s need for land 
as an opportunity to gain access to Indigenous 
territories—perhaps to negotiate carbon 
credits—while risking national sovereignty. 
Otherwise, the Bolivian government’s silence, 
even amid widespread media coverage and in 
an election year, is hard to explain.
It's worth noting that during the height of the 
controversy, the current president of Bolivia 
was photographed receiving a gift from a 
Kailasa representative. Politically, the right 
move would have been to publicly address the 
situation.
That photo was posted on President Luis 
Arce’s social media in October last year, 
during the anniversary of the Indigenous 
organization CIDOB.
How did Kailasa manage to convince 
Indigenous leaders to sign these 
extraordinary 1,000-year land lease 
agreements? What kind of language, 
promises, or strategies did they use to 
earn the trust of these communities?
How they convinced the Indigenous leaders, 
how they initially contacted them, and 
who acted as intermediaries—these are 
the questions many of us want answers 
to. Unfortunately, we still don’t have those 
answers because the Bolivian authorities 
simply deported the members of Kailasa 
without conducting any proper investigation. 
This has led to national criticism and fuels 
the suspicion that many more people may be 
involved behind the scenes.
I have received messages from Kailasa victims 
in other countries, asking whether the 
electronic devices of the Kailasa monks were 
checked to uncover who brought them into 
Bolivia. But even as journalists, we are in the 
dark—this information remains a mystery.
From what I know, Kailasa's promises 
revolved around humanitarian aid. Sadly, 
in Bolivia, many Indigenous communities 
have large expanses of land but very limited 
financial resources to make use of them. On 
top of that, they face constant threats—land 
grabbing, fires, intimidation, and other forms 
of pressure. All of this makes them highly 
vulnerable to exploitation by hidden interests.
It’s also important to clarify that these 
agreements were made between a few 
Indigenous leaders and Kailasa, not with the 
broader Indigenous communities. In most 
cases, the majority of Indigenous people were 
completely unaware of these deals.</p>

I’ve observed that Kailasa operates through 
an organization called the USK Foundation, 
which raises funds under the banner of 
humanitarian assistance. This raises a serious 
concern: Can donors actually verify that the 
aid reaches those it’s meant to help? Because, 
according to the Indigenous people involved, 
they received nothing at all.
This is a crucial point. Kailasa approached 
Indigenous communities with offers of 
humanitarian assistance—the same promises 
they promote on the USK Foundation 
platform.
Beyond the 1,000-year duration, what 
were some of the most unusual or 
alarming clauses you found in the 
lease agreements between Kailasa 
and the Indigenous groups?
The contracts are lengthy—about 40 pages—
and almost all of the clauses are absurd 
and abusive toward the indigenous peoples 
of Bolivia and the country’s sovereignty. 
However, to summarize the most alarming 
points, it appeared as though Kailasa 
wanted the Bolivian state and Indigenous 
communities to serve it—as if it were some 
kind of monarchy.
For example, one clause stated that the 
airspace and the natural resources both above 
and below the ground would be under the 
control of Kailasa. This is illegal, as Bolivian 
law clearly states that such resources belong 
to the Bolivian state. These clauses are a direct 
violation of national sovereignty.
Kailasa also demanded protection in case 
of aggression or persecution and stated that 
this protection should come from both the 
Indigenous communities and state entities 
such as the police. However, in the same 
breath, the contract made it clear that neither 
the Indigenous groups nor the Bolivian 
authorities could interfere in Kailasa’s internal 
affairs.</p>

Another clause even mentioned the word 
asylum—it seems the leader of Kailasa may 
have been seeking to take refuge in Bolivia.
Kailasa also self-identified as an Indigenous 
nation doing business with other Indigenous 
peoples, completely sidestepping the formal 
institutions of the Bolivian state. They claimed 
to have their own passport, embassies, 
currency, and bank and tried to justify all of 
this under the constitutional provision for 
Indigenous autonomy and self-governance in 
Bolivia.
In what way is Kailasa portraying its 
leader, Nithyananda, as belonging 
to an Indigenous community—
specifically the Saiva Vellalar—
when in reality, this group comes 
from an upper-caste Hindu agrarian 
background?  how are they justifying 
this identity?
I don’t know if, in all their approaches to other 
countries, Kailasa representatives claimed to 
be from an Indigenous background, but I do 
know they did so in Ecuador and Bolivia.
In the specific case of Bolivia, the contracts 
signed with Indigenous leaders show that 
Kailasa’s delegates identified themselves as 
Indigenous and strategically invoked certain 
articles of Bolivia’s Political Constitution, 
which grants autonomy and self-governance 
to Indigenous communities—many of whom 
control vast territories.
I believe Kailasa exploited this legal provision 
to gain the trust of Bolivian Indigenous 
communities. But they only used the parts 
of the law that suited their interests. They 
deliberately ignored the other constitutional 
clauses that clearly state Indigenous lands 
are inviolable, non-transferable, non-
mortgageable, and indivisible.
Nithyananda is widely seen as a 
spiritual conman with an uncanny 
ability to deceive. In the case of 
Bolivia, did he personally play any 
role, or was it entirely orchestrated 
by his disciples? What psychological 
tactics or forms of manipulation were 
used to persuade the indigenous 
leaders?
Apparently, the negotiations were carried out 
through Nithyananda’s disciples, but there 
is no certainty. It’s also quite possible that 
Nithyananda himself negotiated directly with 
high-ranking public officials. We could only 
know for sure if the Bolivian state had shown 
an interest in investigating the matter.
I realized the high level of persuasion Kailasa 
employs when their representatives came to 
my office. They are extremely charismatic, 
calm, and persuasive in the way they 
speak—and they often send women ahead 
as representatives. Fortunately, I had already 
read the contracts before meeting them, and 
they clearly contradicted what Kailasa claims 
to stand for. That contradiction raised my 
suspicions about their true intentions.
This religious group promotes a message 
of humanitarian aid, fraternity, and shared 
suffering. They use victimhood narratives 
to place themselves on equal footing with 
Indigenous communities. But the reality is 
that the contracts are irrational, illegal, and 
abusive—especially toward vulnerable groups 
like the Indigenous peoples of Bolivia.

that Nithyananda is widely known for 
using his female monks to get close 
to influential individuals—essentially 
treating them as "sexual offerings," 
according to various investigations. 
Disturbingly, some of these women, 
reportedly under psychological 
manipulation, were said to be willing 
participants. Was there any indication 
of such behavior occurring during 
Kailasa’s operations in Bolivia?
As a journalist, I had minimal contact 
with members of Kailasa, aside from a few 
WhatsApp exchanges with a translator and 
delegate based in Bolivia, and during the time 
of the interview with the authorities of that 
religious group.
What I can confirm is that the majority of 
Kailasa members in Bolivia were women—
at least among those who were deported. 
It appeared they did not make decisions 
independently, often deferring to their 
superiors. Since Bolivian state authorities have 
remained silent on the matter, only they could 
provide definitive answers—if there were any 
genuine interest in conducting a thorough 
investigation.
This information is new to me, so out of 
curiosity, I reached out to a former Kailasa 
member who is still in contact with me. This 
was her response: “Nithyananda runs a human 
trafficking ring—a circle of completely devoted 
individuals whom he sexually exploits. He 
constantly demands explicit photos and 
videos, exerting total manipulation and 
control. These people show absolute loyalty 
and are capable of making any sacrifice or 
carrying out any act for him, even illegal ones 
such as smuggling assets like gold and cash 
across borders, money laundering, and sexual 
services. The leadership functions like a mafia.</p>

Those at the top know everything, while the 
people below are kept in the dark about what’s 
really happening.
The Baure, Cayubaba, and Esse Ejja 
communities are known for their deep 
connection to their ancestral lands. 
How did they come to sign these 
deals with a figure like Nithyananda? 
Was there consensus within the 
communities, or were there differing 
viewpoints and internal debates?
It's clear that there was no consensus regarding 
the signing of the contracts with Kailasa. Proof 
of this is that when this deal was reported in 
the media, the leaders who signed it had to 
publicly retract their claims and withdraw.
Furthermore, in Bolivia, there is a legal 
procedure for Indigenous communities called 
prior consultation. This means that Indigenous 
leaders must consult with the grassroots and 
higher-level organizations on any important 
decision. Further evidence that the entire 
Indigenous population was not consulted is 
that there were moments of tension when the 
residents of the Cayubaba territory demanded 
that the Kailasa monks show them the docu-
ments because their leaders refused to do so.
What was the response from the 
indigenous communities once your 
exposé came out? Did they feel 
deceived, or embarrassed, or were 
some still defending the agreements?
Following the report's publication, the 
Indigenous communities involved publicly 
announced their withdrawal from the 
contract, especially the leaders who signed the 
documents.
In some cases, they claimed they had been 
manipulated in their innocence.
After publishing your story, you faced 
intimidation and threats. Could you 
share more about that experience and 
how you dealt with the pressure to 
silence your reporting?
After the first article was published, I received 
around twenty phone calls from numbers all 
over the world. One of the Indigenous leaders 
involved also messaged me, saying I didn’t 
know who I had messed with.
When the threat became public and received 
significant media attention, that same 
Indigenous leader retracted his statement, 
claiming that he had been under the influence 
of alcohol at the time.
The day after the first publication, 
representatives of Kailasa showed up at my 
office unannounced and waited for hours, even 
though I had told them I would be late. When 
I finally met with them, they appeared friendly 
on the surface, but they refused to show any 
form of identification, and I noticed they were 
taking photos of me secretly. I later found out 
that these photos were sent to the Indigenous 
leaders who had signed the contracts—many 
of whom were feeling nervous about the press 
coverage. Kailasa was using these messages 
to claim they were “influencing me” or had 
control over me.
They also subtly told me that some 
international media outlets had retracted 
their stories. They even showed me supposed 
retraction links on a computer—but refused to 
share them.</p>

Most recently, on Sunday, March 30, I received 
a second threat—this time a legal notice 
from Kailasa, accusing me of defamation and 
discrimination against Kailasa based on their 
Hindu beliefs and Indigenous identity, among 
other things. They demanded a retraction and 
gave me a deadline of 48 hours.
Alongside this threat, they also intimidated 
other Bolivian journalists, gradually sending 
them messages that included links to articles 
Kailasa claimed were defamatory.
How do you assess the Bolivian 
government’s response to the Kailasa 
scandal? Were they proactive, or did 
it take public outrage for authorities to 
act?
The Bolivian government's response was—
and continues to be—shameful, as they have 
not investigated who brought Kailasa into the 
country or for what purpose. They have also 
failed to investigate the threats made against 
the journalists who reported on the issue.
The government’s approach has been to simply 
bury the scandal through brief and vague 
official statements, and even those only came 
after significant public pressure.
Various organizations have condemned 
the threats against journalists—but not the 
Bolivian government.
Do you think we’ve seen the end of 
Kailasa’s operations in South America, 
or is it possible that more hidden 
deals, land grabs, or vulnerable 
communities have been targeted 
elsewhere?
As long as the leader of Kailasa remains a 
fugitive, they will continue looking for places 
to shelter him. I suspect that they are still in 
Bolivia and that not all of their members were 
deported.
They didn’t just reach out to Indigenous 
communities—they also contacted mayors, 
since municipal governments also control 
lands and natural reserves. I believe the world 
needs to be aware of this situation, especially 
Indigenous peoples, many of whom live in 
isolated areas and have no access to this kind 
of information.
In fact, even after reporting on three 
Indigenous territories, we later discovered 
a fourth contract with Kailasa, this time 
involving the Guaraní Indigenous people.
Many of Kailasa’s envoys were 
foreign nationals—Irish, Chinese, 
and American. Did your investigation 
uncover how this diverse network 
was organized and what roles these 
individuals played?
I haven't yet reached that level of research, 
but some victims who predated the events 
in Bolivia contacted me to tell me that many 
followers of Nithyananda are indoctrinated 
in India. They arrive there with the idea of 
mysticism in that country, seeking a spiritual 
answer.
It's easy to see that these people, followers of 
Nithyananda, have no voice since they are 
not authorized to give answers; they are only 
a bridge to other people in more hierarchical 
positions. I could see this when I interviewed 
them; they didn't respond; they only 
connected me with their leaders.</p>

Furthermore, there is a communication 
aspect of Kailasa that is rarely discussed. 
Although these monks have no voice, they 
are trained to film everything and use those 
images to victimize Kailasa. You can see this 
on her social media, where Kailasa claims that 
Bolivian authorities abused her human rights, 
showed them weapons, etc., but she doesn't say 
that the authorities simply took their phones 
because the monks kept recording during the 
Immigration operations.
On its social media platforms, Kailasa 
doesn’t mention how it attempted to exploit 
the Indigenous people of Bolivia—an abuse 
that would likely have continued had the 
contracts not been made public. Kailasa also 
doesn’t share the actual contracts signed 
with Indigenous communities, nor does 
it acknowledge the statements from these 
communities denouncing that they were 
misled and manipulated.
According to your investigation, where 
is Nithyananda’s so-called imaginary 
country ‘The United States of Kailasa’ 
actually located? Some reports claim 
he bought an island in North America, 
while others say it has no real territory 
and functions only as a traveling cult. 
What’s the truth, and is there any 
credible evidence of a physical nation?
When I interviewed representatives of 
Kailasa, they did not provide any concrete 
information about its location. They claimed 
to have autonomous territory and mentioned 
Oceania, but without specifying exactly where. 
Previously, when Kailasa made headlines in 
Ecuador, there were rumors that they had 
purchased an island in that country. There is a 
lot of speculation, but very little certainty.
Without a doubt, Kailasa is a fictitious nation. 
A clear example of this is what happened in 
Bolivia, where they negotiated land while 
demanding sovereignty and even mentioning 
the possibility of asylum—likely to benefit 
Nithyananda himself.
Has Nithyananda made any attempts 
to establish a nation in other parts of 
the Americas—or elsewhere in the 
world? Have you come across any 
credible indications of land claims 
outside Bolivia?
I’m unaware of any efforts outside Bolivia, 
mainly because Kailasa’s publications in other 
countries are very vague and general. From 
what I can tell, their greatest progress was in 
Bolivia, especially regarding the contracts—
perhaps more than anywhere else. But only</p>

Nithyananda truly knows the full extent of 
their activities.
However, as I mentioned earlier, Kailasa 
claims to possess sovereign, autonomous, and 
semi-autonomous territories. One person who 
might know the locations of these claimed 
territories—at least in Latin America—is 
Miguel Antonio Chumapi, an Ecuadorian 
lawyer affiliated with Kailasa. He lobbied with 
Indigenous communities in Bolivia and has 
also worked with the group in Ecuador.
Nithyananda is a rape accused and a 
fugitive wanted by the Indian government. 
As a journalist who has uncovered the 
global scope of his activities, what would 
you say to the Government of India? Is 
there more they can do?
As a journalist, I would tell the Indian 
government that if they are truly interested 
in locating Nithyananda, they should 
communicate directly with the Bolivian 
government and request the names and 
passport details of the individuals who were 
deported, so they can be properly investigated. 
They should also inquire whether their 
electronic devices were examined.
Perhaps the Indian government could uncover 
more than what we, as Bolivian journalists, 
have been able to.
What would you like to say to 
Nithyananda’s blind followers—
particularly in India, Sri Lanka, and 
other countries—who continue to 
believe in him despite the mounting 
evidence and criminal charges against 
him?
I would say: Don’t let your need for spiritual 
connection lead you into networks of 
manipulation. If I hadn’t read the contracts 
between Kailasa and the Indigenous 
communities in Bolivia before interviewing 
the monks, I might have believed them—
they’re extremely convincing in person. 
But they’re also manipulative on social 
media, where they distort reality to suit their 
narrative.
However, the documents speak for themselves. 
They are harmful to Indigenous communities, 
a threat to state sovereignty, and completely 
contradict Kailasa’s public message of 
humanitarian aid.
There were red flags from the start: they 
avoided showing their identity documents, 
didn’t say where they were staying, and didn’t 
speak freely without permission from their 
leaders.
They present themselves as friendly to 
gain trust—but once questioned, they turn 
threatening, just as they did with us, the 
Bolivian journalists. They demand retractions 
under the threat of legal action.
Another disturbing sign: they weren’t 
even living in the territory, yet one of the 
two houses in the Cayubaba territory was 
designated as Kailasa’s Supreme Court 
of Justice. That tells us that their judicial 
arm is more important to them than their 
humanitarian mission or diplomatic presence.
The question is—why a Supreme Court? Is it 
to intimidate Indigenous communities, or for 
something else?
Only Kailasa’s current and former members, 
who are subject to that system of justice, know 
the answer.</p>
