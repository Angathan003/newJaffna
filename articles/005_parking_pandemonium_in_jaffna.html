Residents 
and 
visitors 
of 
Jaffna 
are 
expressing growing concerns over the recent 
implementation of parking fees by the Jaffna 
Municipal Council. Reports indicate that 
individuals leaving bicycles or motorcycles 
in the Jaffna town streets, even briefly to visit 
shops, are being approached by unidentified 
persons demanding parking fees.
This new practice has been especially prevalent 
in the town area of Jaffna, where individuals 
unexpectedly confront commuters with receipts 
ready to collect fees for parking two-wheelers. 
This has led to significant inconvenience for 
those needing to make multiple stops across 
various streets, as they are required to pay a fee 
at each location.

What's troubling is the lack of clear identification 
or official authorization of these fee collectors, 
who claim to represent the Jaffna Municipal 
Council. This ambiguity raises questions about 
the legitimacy and management of the collected 
funds.
The issue has escalated recently, reflecting the 
poor administrative oversight by the Jaffna 
Municipal Council representatives and relevant 
government officials. A notable incident 
occurred during the Nallur Festival, where a 
major street closure led to increased congestion 
and distress among attendees. This incident 
highlighted the arbitrary and disruptive nature 
of the council's decisions.
In a time when the general populace is already 
burdened by rising prices and increased service 
taxes, this additional financial imposition 
for basic activities like parking is seen as 
unreasonable and exploitative. It echoes the 
sentiment of adding insult to injury for the 
already struggling local community.
Concerns are mounting over the accountability 
and transparency of these practices. The 
responsibility for addressing these issues rests 
with the Commissioner of the Jaffna Municipal 
Council. 
Driven by their frustration, a few residents of 
Jaffna have jokingly proposed a more orderly 
approach, suggesting the establishment of official 
toll booths at the city's gateways, equipped with 
a transparent and equitable system for entry 
fees similar to those on highways. This tongue-
in-cheek idea is in stark contrast to the current 
practice of haphazardly imposing parking fees 
at every possible location.
The Jaffna Municipal Council has yet to respond 
to these concerns, leaving residents and visitors 
uncertain and frustrated as they navigate the 
city's streets.</p>

he Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) 
youth wing's state conference in Salem, 
Tamil Nadu, was marked by the attendance 
of Inbanithi, great-grandson of late Kalaignar 
Karunanidhi. This event has stirred debate 
in Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka, and among the 
Tamil diaspora, focusing on DMK's leadership 
succession pattern. Critics highlight a lineage 
pattern from Karunanidhi to his son Stalin, 
then to Stalin's son Udhayanidhi, and now 
Udhayanidhi's son Inbanithi. This issue is 
notably contentious among supporters of 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
in the diaspora, who have been vocal on 
platforms like Facebook.
Whether right or wrong, in DMK, at least, 
leaders and other positions are chosen 
through elections democratically. But has any 
organisation that fought for Tamil Eelam- a 
separate country for Lankan Tamils, ever 
elected its leaders democratically? Especially 
the LTTE, which I was part of, never had even 
a hint of democratic principles at any time.
The leader of the LTTE, Prabhakaran, 
who called his organisation a liberation 
organisation, intended and acted towards 
making his son Charles Anthony the leader 
of the LTTE after him. Charles Anthony was

raised on the organisation's funds from birth. 
But was he trained like other fighters? Not at 
all. 
Every individual who became a part of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
whether through voluntary enlistment 
or conscription, underwent a mandatory 
regimen of basic military training before being 
deployed to the frontlines. The assignment of 
leadership roles, such as commanders or other 
positions of responsibility, was contingent 
upon an assessment of their combat prowess 
and effectiveness in the field. Additionally, 
certain individuals, distinguished by their 
academic and educational backgrounds, 
were directly chosen for leadership positions. 
Nevertheless, these individuals were also 
required to demonstrate their capabilities in 
combat situations prior to their appointment. 
However, Prabhakaran established a 
specialised division known as the computer 
wing. He directly appointed his son, Charles 
Anthony, as the head of this new division. This 
division of the LTTE was notably allocated 
greater resources and power compared to 
other divisions. 
The circumstances surrounding Charles 
Anthony's appointment as the leader of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
's computer division remain ambiguous. 
Unlike other members, he did not undergo 
the standard basic training protocol nor serve 
in any combat or administrative capacities 
within the organisation. Despite this lack of 
conventional experience within the LTTE's 
structure, in early 2006, the computer division 
was explicitly established for him. He was 
then assigned significant responsibilities 
and resources within this new division. This 
decision raises questions about the rationale 
and criteria used for his appointment to this 
prominent role. 
The computer unit within the LTTE, primarily 
tasked with the production of IEDs, including 
Claymores and other explosives, was more 
than just a unit focused on computer-related 
activities. This division, known initially as 
the Technical Division, was under the adept 
leadership of Pradeep Master. He was an 
outstanding fighter, endowed with extensive 
technical knowledge, and was responsible 
for significant innovations. Pradeep Master,

a skilled warrior from the LTTE's fourth 
division, received his training in India, 
bringing a wealth of experience to his role.
However, his tenure in the division came to 
an abrupt end when he was sidelined and 
replaced by Charles Antony following the 
deliberate highlighting of certain shortcomings 
in his work. This move led to Pradeep Master 
being completely excluded from any active 
role within the organisation. He was 'frozen' in 
the LTTE's terminology, signifying complete 
exclusion from duties. 
Charles Antony was appointed head of the 
computer division solely because he was 
Prabhakaran's son. Following his appointment, 
he showed no respect for any commanders 
and acted like an authoritarian. Other LTTE 
commanders hesitated to criticise Charles's 
actions due to his status as Prabhakaran's 
son. They even avoided mentioning Charles 
Antony's name in the organisation, respectfully 
referring to him as 'Thampi' (younger brother), 
a name once used for Prabhakaran in the early 
stages of his military career. However, Charles 
Antony did not reciprocate any respect and 
treated all the commanders and fighters as 
insignificant.
Charles formed his own battalion, consisting 
of about 1,000 fighters, and equipped them 
with the most modern weapons. At one point, 
nearly half of the Tigers' resources were under 
Charles's control. However, despite his position 
as a designated leader and commander, 
Charles had no combat experience and 
never participated in significant battles. 
Furthermore, he refrained from sending his 
fighters into battle as well.
Velavan, who had once served as 
Prabhakaran's personal bodyguard, was 
later appointed in charge of Imran Pandian's 
battalion and had been acquainted with 
Charles Antony since the latter was around 
12 or 13 years old. During a period of active 
combat, when Velavan's battalion was facing a 
shortage of personnel, he held several meetings 
with Charles Antony to request reinforcements

from Charles's battalion personally. However, 
Charles consistently refused these requests. 
Velavan shared this incident with me in a 
personal conversation, clearly conveying his 
profound disappointment and heartbreak 
caused by Charles's behavior.
The first battle in which Charles Antony 
participated was the Thevipuram battle in 
February 2009, just a few months before the 
LTTE was militarily vanquished. The battle 
was led by Sornam, with Charles Antony 
serving as one of the commanders. During the 
combat, Charles Antony and his troops fled the 
battlefield cowardly, leaving behind 
approximately 500 advanced 
rifles. This act became a subject of 
ridicule within the Tigers' circles. 
I can confidently state that no 
one in the Tigers' organisation 
speaks highly of Charles Antony. 
Prabhakaran appointed his 
inexperienced, ill-mannered, and 
unskilled son as his undeclared 
heir, entrusting him with half of 
the Tigers' military strength. In this 
context, the question arises: how 
can those who follow such a leader 
be justified in criticising DMK?
Currently, within the circles 
of LTTE supporters, there is 
a noticeable dependence on 
the figure of Dwaraka, who is 
represented as the daughter of 
Prabhakaran, to revive their 
movement. I am confident that she 
is not the actual Dwaraka, but these 
implications extend far beyond 
her identity. Using Prabhakaran's 
purported daughter, real or not, 
raises significant questions about 
the LTTE's operational principles. This 
trend should be viewed as an idolisation of 
Prabhakaran and his family, deviating from the 
fundamental ethos of the movement. It brings 
to light a critical issue: Are LTTE supporters 
mirroring political parties like the DMK, 
which openly celebrate the legacies of their 
leaders?
