I
n early November 2022, there 
was a systematic spread of 
news among the wealthy business 
community in Switzerland. 
The information, disseminated 
primarily through word of 
mouth, suggested that LTTE 
supremo Prabhakaran, his wife 
Mathivathani, and daughter 
Duwaraka were alive. This rumor 
was perpetuated in a coordinated 
manner: one individual would 
claim to have met Prabhakaran's 
family, and another would 
corroborate this claim, with both 
being part of a group deceiving 
people in the name of Prabhakaran.
Subsequently, a group of wealthy 
Sri Lankan Tamil businessmen 
convened at a residence in 
Switzerland upon the request of 
former LTTE fund collectors. These 
businessmen, known for their 
historical support of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
were gathered with the anticipation 
of meeting a significant figure. 
During this assembly, a woman 
with her face and hair obscured by 
a veil appeared, introducing herself 
as Mathivathani, the wife of LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran. She addressed 
the business community, revealing 
that she, along with her husband 
Prabhakaran and daughter, were 
alive while her two sons, Charles 
Antony and Balachandran, had 
perished. She recounted how she, 
her husband, and daughter had 
escaped from the war zone to 
Europe. Emphasizing the need 
for support, she implored the 
community for funds, stating that 
her husband was regrouping the 
LTTE and that he was currently 
unwell.
Her story painted a vivid picture 
of their escape from the war 
zone, a perilous journey that had 
led them to the relative safety of 
Europe. Mathivathani's words 
carried a plea for help. When a 
curious businessman requested her 
to remove her veil to confirm her 
identity, she refused, citing security 
risks. Despite this, a large portion 
of the businessmen present believed 
the narrative and immediately 
donated substantial sums of money 
to aid Prabhakaran's supposed 
efforts in regrouping the LTTE and 
his medical expenses. 
However, one businessman, a 
significant former donor to the 
LTTE, harbored doubts. Instead of 
voicing his skepticism, he requested 
a meeting with Prabhakaran. The 
veiled woman denied this request, 
again citing security concerns. 
The businessman then proposed 
meeting Duwaraka, promising a 
hefty donation if his request was 
granted. The woman agreed to this.
In the meantime, the businessman 
had obtained credible information 
about Duwaraka from a Sothiya 
regiment female LTTE fighter living 
in London since the 2009 war. This 
included the name of Duwaraka's 
driving instructor and details about 
her active participation in the 
LTTE.
After a few days, the businessman 
was taken to a safe house to meet 
the alleged Duwaraka, also veiled. 
She requested large sums for her 
father's efforts in reorganizing 
the LTTE and mentioned his ill 
health. In a friendly manner, the 
businessman asked her several 
questions based on the information 
he had gathered. To his suspicion, 
the alleged Duwaraka answered all 
the questions incorrectly.

Realizing the deceit, the businessman amiably exited 
the meeting, feigning a promise to donate generously. 
Instead, he alerted the rest of the business community 
about the scam. However, by this time, many had 
already donated substantial Swiss money to the cause.
Duping Devotees: The Story of a Multi-Million Rupee 
LTTE Scam in Europe
During the final three months of 2022, a noticeable 
campaign among Sri Lankan Tamils in Swiss cities 
like Zurich, Bern, and Basel was conducted by former 
pro-LTTE activists. This campaign keenly targeted 
the business community and individuals who were 
fervent LTTE sympathizers or those who idolized 
Prabhakaran, treating him akin to a demi-god. The 
strategy was to specifically focus on those with a deep 
emotional connection to the LTTE and its supreme 
leader, intentionally excluding the general populace or 
those without such a connection.
The approach was tailored to exploit the emotions of 
those deeply attached to the LTTE and Prabhakaran, 
reducing their inclination to question or verify the 
claims. In intimate group meetings, two women, 
alleging to be Prabhakaran's wife and daughter and 
with their faces partly covered, appealed for financial 
assistance. They claimed that Prabhakaran was actively 
working on regrouping the LTTE and highlighted 
his poor health as an urgent matter. Many, swayed by 
their emotional ties to the cause and its leader, readily 
opened their wallets to contribute.
This pattern of meetings and appeals gradually began 
to spread to other European countries. Credible 
sources have informed Jaffna Monitor that, in a 
relatively brief period, the group implicated in the 
scam managed to accumulate a staggering sum of 
approximately 5000 crore Sri Lankan Rupees from 
unsuspecting LTTE sympathizers. 
A Saga of Fraud
Against the backdrop of these rumors about 
Prabhakaran planning to revive the LTTE, a person 
impersonating his daughter, Dwaraka, delivered a 
speech on Maaveerar Naal (Great Heroes Day). This 
event added another layer to the unfolding narrative.
According to credible sources reported to Jaffna 
Monitor, the architect of this elaborate fraudulent 
scheme is Jeevaratnam Jeevakumar, also known as 
"Chiranjeevi master," a former deputy to the ex-LTTE 
intelligence chief "Pottu Ammaan." The strategy 
devised by "master" was allegedly put into action 
by "Abdullah," previously the financial head for the 
Swiss Tigers. Abdullah, whose real name is Chelliah 
Jeyapalan from Aanaikottai in Jaffna, is believed to be 
the primary coordinator and executor of this deceptive 
operation.
These sources further indicate that the intricacies of 
this operation suggest the involvement or knowledge 
of the current Swiss tiger chief, Ragupathy, hinting at 
a deeper network within the remnants of the LTTE's 
overseas operations.
Betrayal of Trust: How Mathivathani's Family Fueled 
the LTTE Scam
Adding complexity to the 
scheme, sources have revealed 
that the Eerampu family, 
relatives of Prabhakaran's 
wife Mathivathani, were later 
convinced to participate 
in this scam. Reportedly, 
after receiving a substantial 
amount of money, they agreed 
to be part of the operation. 
Mathivathani's elder sister, 
Aruna, who lives in London, 
lent credibility to the claim 
by asserting that she recently 
met her sister Mathivathani, 
brother-in-law Prabhakaran and 
niece Duwaraga. Although the 
authenticity of her testimony 
is questionable, it comes from 
Prabhakaran's family and adds 
significant weight to the scam.
Mathivathani's elder brother, 
Sreetharan, who lives in 
Denmark, is also implicated 
in this scam. Other individuals named by sources 
include Nimalan, Varadhan, and Mithulan from 
Prabhakaran's bodyguard unit; Jayakanthan, who 
was in charge of the unit; Siriskandaraja Ranjith from 
Varathupalaya, known as Cheraman in Britain; and a 
major contributor, the individual posing as the fake 
Dwarka. These revelations suggest a complex and well-
orchestrated scheme involving multiple individuals 
with connections to the LTTE.
