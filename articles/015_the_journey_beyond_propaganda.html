T
hirteen years ago, one fine day, I took the bold step 
to mildly criticize the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE) and its leader, Prabhakaran, in a Facebook 
post. My criticism, written in Tamil, read as follows: 
'jiytu; vq;fSf;fhf rpe;jpf;fpwhu; vd ehq;fs; Nkhl;L 
tisaj;ij ghu;j;Jf;nfhz;L ,Ue;Jtpl;Nlhk;. jiytu; 
vq;fisf; nfhz;L Ngha; Ks;sptha;f;fhy; Kl;Lr; 
re;Jf;Fs; epWj;jptpl;lhu;". When translated, it essentially 
means, "We have been idly lying around, staring at the ceiling, 
thinking that our leader is doing the thinking for us. But, the 
leader has led us to a dead-end at Mullivaikal'.
The backlash from my then-close Tamil friends was immediate 
and intense; they questioned my birth, my value, and the level 
of my IQ; one of my classmates from Jaffna Hindu College 
commented in that Facebook post, suggesting with a tone 
of sympathy, "Surely, you must be out of your senses to level

criticism at Our boys or our leader. It would be wise for 
you to seek a psychiatric evaluation." Others, who were 
more confrontational, challenged me to return to Jaffna, 
insinuating that a harsh lesson awaited me there.
The Indoctrination of Tamil Youth Compared 
to North Korea
The response I got for the post can draw parallels with 
the kind of reaction you might expect from staunch, 
brainwashed religious or cult followers. The very idea 
of questioning the LTTE's actions or its leader was 
blasphemous to many of my close friends. If you were born 
and raised in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka 
during the 1980s and 1990s, where the majority are Tamils, 
there's a good chance you were never introduced to the 
notion that no person or organization is beyond criticism. 
For the youth of that era, Prabhakaran's word was taken as 
law.
The extent of indoctrination that the Tamil youth 
experienced in the 1980s and 1990s in the northern 
and eastern regions, in my view, mirrors the intensity of 
indoctrination imposed by the North Korean regime on 
its own people. I recall viewing a video years ago in which 
North Korean citizens were seen weeping at the mere 
sight of their Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un. In the video, 
an elderly woman, with great emotion, expressed to the 
television crew how her beloved leader was safeguarding 
their nation from the mighty United States and its allies. 
The facets of North Korean existence — from Information 
Isolation, Forced Labor, and Human Rights Violations to 
Travel Restrictions — are deeply ingrained in daily life. 
However, when indoctrination takes deep root, one might 
find justifiable reasoning in every action taken by their 
revered leader, wouldn't you agree? This same manner 
of mental conditioning was imposed on the minds of my 
generation, and tragically, many remain unaware that even 
their once leader, Prabhakaran, or his organization, are 
subject to evaluation and criticism.
The Cult of the 'Sun God': Deepening the Indoctrination
The image of Prabhakaran as an uneducated figure does 
not accurately reflect his exceptional skills in manipulating 
propaganda and carrying out systematic indoctrination. 
His effectiveness in these realms was such that the LTTE 
managed to effectively eliminate other Tamil militant 
groups that had surfaced to advocate for the exact cause. 
These groups were condemned as traitors, and their 
members, including intellectuals and prominent figures, 
were executed ruthlessly. These extreme actions were 
condoned by a significant section of the Tamil public, who, 
influenced by LTTE's persuasive propaganda, believed such 
measures were a necessary evil in the fight for freedom.
Rationalizing Atrocities Under Propaganda
During the era of Prabhakaran's leadership, his singular 
ideology became the defining narrative for the entire 
movement. His perspectives and tactics weren't merely 
representative of the LTTE; they were emphatically 
instilled within the Tamil youth. Such was the level of 
indoctrination that reached a point where the child began 
to internalize the belief that a 'normal' thought process 
echoed the staunch devotion of an ardent LTTE supporter.
The Perils of Absolute Ideology and Suppressed Criticism
The potency of the LTTE's propaganda instilled a deep 
conviction among many youths of my generation that 
Prabhakaran was not just a leader but a "Sooriya Thevan," 
a "Sun God," endowed with an almost mystical aura of 
invincibility. This perception was bolstered by the LTTE's 
unexpected military victories under Prabhakaran's 
leadership, feats that seemed to defy reality and elevated 
his status to one of divine-like reverence. The propaganda 
machine systematically cultivated an environment where 
questioning his decisions was tantamount to heresy. 
Followers were urged to emulate the unquestioning 
obedience found in the pages of religious texts, where faith 
dictates that the word is to be followed without doubt or 
debate.
Blind Allegiance Among Educated Professionals
The effectiveness of the LTTE's propaganda is evident 
in the manner in which they secured the allegiance of 
many Tamils, convincing them to rationalize even the 
horrors they perpetrated against their own. The LTTE 
excelled in crafting narratives that glorified the ultimate</p>

sacrifices of their youth, linking their cadres' loss of life 
to the organization's ruthless actions. Tamils harbour 
deep sentiments for the thousands of young lives lost to 
the cause of the LTTE, with a prevailing belief that these 
individuals surrendered everything for their people's 
welfare, thus nurturing a profound sentiment within the 
community.
Learning from the LTTE's Strategic Failures
However, the irony lies in the fact that even those Tamils 
who fervently supported the Tamil cause yet expressed 
any dissent towards the LTTE's strategies were quickly 
labelled as traitors. For instance, in the LTTE-controlled 
areas, suggesting in 2006 that Prabhakaran's actions were 
leading the community towards a catastrophic outcome 
like that of Mullivaikkal would be enough to have one 
deemed a traitor and likely executed. This draconian stance 
towards any form of criticism created an atmosphere where 
open dialogue was stifled, and it inevitably contributed to 
the tragic and unnecessary loss of thousands of lives. The 
LTTE's indoctrination was so entrenched that it not only 
justified their brutalities but also silenced those who dared 
to question their approach, regardless of how faithfully 
they championed the Tamil cause.
Looking Towards a Future of Liberated Minds
What's startling is that even after the glaring failures of the 
LTTE's strategies, many from my generation, including 
accomplished professionals like doctors, engineers, and 
lawyers, remain blinded. Listening to their one-sided, 
impractical, and unrealistic arguments, I often wonder: 
how could someone with such brainwashed views become 
such a studious and knowledgeable individual? That 
sometimes leads me to wonder, Do brainwashing and 
academic studies engage different parts of the brain?
In the end, the legacy of the LTTE and the indoctrination 
of Tamil youth stands as a sombre reminder of the perils of 
absolute ideology and the critical need for open dialogue 
and introspection within any movement. True liberation 
cannot be achieved when minds are shackled by the 
chains of dogma and uncritical allegiance. As we look 
to the future, it is paramount that we heed the lessons 
of our past, recognizing that genuine freedom is rooted 
in the empowerment of the individual to think freely 
and critically. In my opinion, you cannot liberate people 
with their minds in chains. The path to true liberation is 
paved with questioning minds, the courage to challenge 
monolithic narratives, and the willingness to embrace 
diverse perspectives.
At the very least, this can be a starting point for some 
much-needed self-reflection.
A. Varadaraja Perumal, the former Chief Minister of Sri 
Lanka's North-Eastern Province, emphasized the need 
for Sri Lankan Tamil parties to increase engagement 
with India to address the Tamil issue. In an interview 
after a book launch in Coimbatore, he expressed concern 
that current Tamil leaders are not actively pursuing 
dialogue with Indian counterparts, unlike during 1983-
87. Perumal stressed the importance of India's role in 
resolving the Tamil question, noting that the Indian 
government's actions must be supported by its people 
and leaders. He advocated for closer ties between Tamil 
leaders and officials in New Delhi and Tamil Nadu.
Perumal warned against extreme or radical approaches 
and highlighted the significance of properly 
implementing Sri Lanka's 13th Constitutional 
Amendment, which deals with devolution of power 
to provincial councils. He suggested revisiting this 
Amendment, with Indian legal experts advising on 
its effective implementation. Additionally, Perumal 
called for humane consideration of Sri Lankan refugees 
in Tamil Nadu, proposing solutions like providing 
permanent documents for employment and easing 
restrictions on their travel to Sri Lanka.
