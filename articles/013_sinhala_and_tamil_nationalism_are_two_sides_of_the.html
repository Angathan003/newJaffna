INTERVIEW
"Sinhala and Tamil Nationalism 
Are Two Sides of the Same 
Coin—Both Rooted in the Flawed 
Logic of Territorial Ownership 
and Ethnic Exclusivity”
BY: 
Our Special Correspondent
- LTTE Co-founder Ragavan
Part  05
How do you perceive the protests 
against Tissa Raja Maha Vihara in 
Thaiyiddy, Jaffna, with some Tamil 
nationalist politicians calling for 
its demolition? Similarly, how do 
you view Sinhala settlements in 
traditionally Tamil-majority areas—
are they a state-backed demographic 
shift or natural migration? Do these 
settlements threaten Tamil identity 
and political rights, or is this concern 
exaggerated?

I believe there needs to be a paradigm shift in 
how land disputes and ethnic discourse are 
framed, particularly concerning land grabbing. 
Historical events do not follow a linear 
trajectory but rather form a complex web of 
regressions, progressions, and socio-political 
changes. Both Sinhala and Tamil nationalist 
historiographies have portrayed settlement 
processes through the lens of traditional 
homelands, often overlooking broader socio-
economic factors.
In principle, people have the right to move and 
settle anywhere in Sri Lanka. Migration, both 
within and beyond territorial boundaries, has 
been a historical constant. For example, in the 
1890s, many Tamils from the Jaffna Peninsula 
migrated to Trincomalee for employment 
at the colonial military base. Similarly, the 
colonial government brought Tamils from 
India to work in the plantation sector, where 
they were severely exploited.
Muslims and Sinhalese also migrated 
across the island in pursuit of economic 
opportunities. Tamils from the North, 
particularly from Delft and other small islands, 
settled in the Wanni before the war, which led 
to tensions with local communities. A local 
group called 'aho; mfw;W rq;fk;" ( Yaal 
Agatru Sangam-Jaffna Eviction Association) 
emerged in response, opposing the settlement 
of Jaffna Tamils. Likewise, Malayaga Tamils 
who were displaced by anti-Tamil riots settled 
in the Wanni but were often marginalized.
 A former LTTE member admitted that when 
the LTTE instructed Tamils from Jaffna to 
relocate to the Vanni in 1996—amid the 
military's advance—thousands were displaced. 
At that time, Mayilāyāka Tamils, who had 
resettled in the Vanni after the 1977 anti-Tamil 
riots, owned fertile roadside lands—properties 
that would be worth crores of rupees today.
The newly displaced Jaffna Tamils, many 
of whom had money but no land in Vanni, 
allegedly lured the Mayilāyāka Tamils into 
relocating further inland by offering them Rs. 
5,000 as a ‘gift.’ Officially, such land—granted 
under a permit—cannot be sold; it is only 
transferred as a gift. Though the LTTE did 
not directly orchestrate these transactions, 
they were the de facto governing authority 
in the area. As such, they had the power—
and the responsibility—to prevent this quiet 
dispossession. But they didn’t.
 In my view, this was an appropriation of land 
through deception, carried out in the shadow 
of war and sanctioned by silence.
The real issue, however, lies in state-sponsored 
Sinhala settlements. While forcible settlement 
schemes and military occupations must be 
confronted, agrarian development programs 
should be analyzed separately. Poor, landless 
peasants from the South were promised 
land and economic stability, leading to 
voluntary settlements. Until the late 1970s, 
Tamil and Muslim communities were not 
forcibly displaced through these programs 
and were, in some cases, allocated land for 
cultivation. However,  there were allegations 
that Sinhala settlers were given priority in land 
distribution. Projects like the Gal Oya scheme 
led to demographic shifts and occasional 
tensions, yet nationalist historiographies tend 
to ignore the broader socio-economic context 
in favor of ethnic narratives.
Sinhala settlement in the dry zone can be 
broadly categorized into three phases. The first 
phase, from the 1930s to 1980, was driven by 
food shortages and the colonial government's 
efforts to encourage agricultural production. 
More than 80% of Sri Lankan land was state-
owned (formerly crown land during British 
rule). D.S. Senanayake pursued two key 
objectives: achieving self-sufficiency in food</p>

production and glorifying ancient Sinhala 
agrarian development. The Gal Oya project, 
completed in 1953 under the leadership of 
a Jaffna Tamil, Kanagasundaram, served 
multiple purposes, including hydroelectric 
power generation, agrarian expansion, and 
sugar production. While Sinhala landless 
peasants were settled in the East, this phase 
did not involve the systematic displacement 
of Tamils and Muslims. In fact, Tamils and 
Muslims from the Eastern Province were 
encouraged to participate in the settlement. 
However, most of them were reluctant to move 
into the schemes, as they already had access to 
fertile lands in the East.
The second phase, from the 1980s to 2009, was 
characterized by militarization and Sinhala-
Buddhist nationalism, leading to land grabbing 
and forced evictions. The state aggressively 
promoted Sinhala settlements while displacing 
Tamil and Muslim communities, often under 
the pretext of agrarian development, but in 
reality, to create buffer zones against Tamil 
militancy.  Tamil villagers were forcibly 
expelled, and some were killed by security 
forces. The Weli Oya project is a prime 
example of this militarized settlement strategy. 
The University Teachers for Human Rights 
(Jaffna) (UTHR-J) documented widespread 
human rights violations, but Tamil nationalists 
largely overlooked their findings, undermining 
their critical work.
During the Weli Oya project, Tamil villages 
were depopulated, and their lands were 
handed over to Sinhala settlers, who were 
simultaneously recruited as Home Guards to 
fight against Tamil militants. Scholars such 
as Thiruni Kelagama and Korf described this 
as "the lure of the land." These settlers were 
ultimately betrayed by the state, facing severe 
water shortages and becoming targets for 
LTTE attacks. Meanwhile, military expansion 
under the guise of national security resulted 
in the establishment of High-Security Zones 
(HSZs), where lands belonging to Tamils and 
Muslims were seized.
The third phase, after 2009, saw the 
continuation of Sinhala-Buddhist ideological 
expansionism, military land appropriation, 
and commercial ventures. Following the 
end of the war, the military retained vast 
tracts of land under the pretext of national 
security, but many of these lands were used for 
tourism, agribusiness, and private enterprises, 
particularly under the Rajapaksa regime. 
The Yahapalana government (2015–2019) 
claimed to have returned 80–85% of military-
occupied lands, but in practice, many rightful 
owners were denied access. Under Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa, land acquisitions intensified, with 
sacred Buddhist sites being established on 
seized Tamil-owned lands under the guise of 
archaeological conservation.
It is important to recognize that land grabbing 
has not affected only Tamils. In Trincomalee 
and Ampara, the state has also appropriated</p>

lands belonging to Muslims.  In 
Ambara,  the lands of Sinhala 
villagers were also appropriated.<br />
However, Tamil nationalist 
discourse does not acknowledge 
this, as it considers the North 
and East to be exclusively Tamil 
territories.
Under the NPP government, 
there's little evidence of new 
land grabs. The Thaiyiddy 
issue, however, warrants 
critical examination. Unlike 
past land protests in the East 
and Wanni, this case gained 
national attention—largely due 
to Jaffna-centric mobilization 
by right-wing Tamil nationalists 
exploiting ethnic and religious 
tensions. A Vihara existed in 
Thaiyiddy since 1948 but was 
abandoned after the 1958 riots, 
rebuilt, and then destroyed by 
Tamil militants in 1978. The area 
later became part of a High-
Security Zone (HSZ). While 
HSZs may have been justifiable 
during the war, retaining land 
after the conflict isn’t. Instead of 
restoring the Vihara at its original 
site, the Gotabaya regime enabled 
the building of a new temple on 
privately owned Tamil land—an 
undeniable violation.
The rightful owners of the land 
have every reason to protest. 
However, the involvement of 
right-wing Tamil nationalists 
and certain Hindu religious 
leaders—who appear to be using 
the issue for political gain—is 
troubling. Initially, the owners 
reportedly pursued a negotiated 
settlement, requesting alternative land nearby. A letter to 
this effect was submitted to Governor Vethanayagam. But 
Tamil nationalists, both local and overseas, opposed the 
compromise and pressured the owners to instead demand 
the destruction of the Vihara. Interestingly, there’s an 
unconfirmed story that a Tamil Buddhist Sangam abroad 
contributed financially to the Vihara’s construction, 
unaware that it stood on privately owned Tamil land.
Narrowing the land dispute to religious sentiment risks 
deepening divisions. Instead of framing land rights 
through the lens of Tamil nationalism or religious 
exclusivity, broader issues—such as militarization, 
economic justice, and political rights—must be brought 
to the forefront.
The government has both a political and moral 
responsibility to ensure a fair resolution. It should allocate 
land outside the Vihara premises while compensating</p>

rightful owners. Progressive activists and 
intellectuals must continue pressuring the 
government to uphold its electoral promises, 
particularly regarding the release of all 
military-occupied lands. Additionally, the state 
must recognize the importance of land access 
for livelihood, particularly in regions like the 
Wanni, where communities depend on state 
lands for survival. Military claims over such 
lands are unjustifiable.
The NPP’s Clean Sri Lanka project aims to 
achieve social and environmental progress 
within a defined timeframe. A similar task 
force should be established to address land 
grabbing and military expansionism. Sri Lanka 
must move beyond ethnicized narratives to 
adopt an inclusive approach that ensures land 
rights for all communities, fostering long-term 
peace and coexistence.
What mistakes are the current Tamil 
leaders and Tamil political parties 
making? As an early militant, how do 
you view this trend?
That is an important question. It is true 
that post-colonial Sri Lanka was shaped 
as a majoritarian, ethno-nationalist 
state. However, countering this with an 
equally rigid Tamil nationalist ideology is 
counterproductive. Tamil nationalism cannot 
serve as a counterweight to Sinhala-Buddhist 
nationalism—doing so only entrenches a cycle 
of exclusivist identity politics.
Sinhala supremacists have long clung to the 
Mahavamsa narrative, which falsely portrays 
Sri Lanka as an exclusively Sinhala-Buddhist 
land—divinely ordained for them. In reaction, 
Tamil nationalists have crafted a mirror image: 
a counter-narrative that claims the North 
and East as an exclusive Tamil homeland, 
historically ruled and inhabited solely by 
Tamils. Though seemingly at odds, both 
ideologies are built on the same foundation—
territorial entitlement, cultural exceptionalism, 
and exclusion. At their core, both stem from 
ethno-nationalist thinking—and both are 
historically flawed.
When the Federal Party was formed in 1949, 
its advocacy for federalism was broader than 
today's ethnic Tamil nationalism. The Party’s 
concept of “Tamil-speaking people” included 
Muslims and Malayaga Tamils.
However, when it claimed the North and 
East as the traditional homeland of Tamil-
speaking people, it came to be seen as a 
Tamil homeland. This was problematic, as 
most Muslims lived outside these provinces 
and had distinct political concerns, while 
the disenfranchised Malayaga Tamils lived 
primarily in the south. I once spoke to 
Thilagar, a Malayaga Tamil politician, who 
told me: “You were asking for separation, 
while we, after being made stateless, fought for 
citizenship and inclusion.”
The Federal Party’s vision of Tamil-speaking 
unity collapsed after the Vaddukoddai 
Resolution of 1976, which called for a separate 
state. Although the Resolution retained the 
term “Tamil-speaking people,” it framed Tamil 
Eelam around the historical Tamil kingdoms, 
embedding ethnic nationalism into its core 
political demand. Once territorial claims are 
tied to an ethnic identity, exclusion becomes 
inevitable.
Merely residing in a particular region does 
not justify territorial sovereignty. History is a 
story of migration, intermixing, and evolving 
identities. Traditions are often retroactively 
constructed to serve political narratives. There 
is no scientific or historical basis for exclusive</p>

Tamil ancestral rights over the North and 
East. Nationalism itself is a modern construct, 
that emerged in the 18th century. Before that, 
ethnic identities were fluid and not central to 
political power.
In ancient Sri Lanka, Tamil warriors served 
in Sinhala armies, and vice versa. Ethnic 
divisions were not sharply defined in the social 
or political order.
 According to historian Nira Wickramasinghe, 
the 1871 census listed 78 “nationalities” and 
24 “races.” By 1911, the census had begun 
categorizing populations more rigidly—
distinguishing among groups such as Kandyan 
and Low Country Sinhalese, Ceylon and 
Indian Tamils, Muslims, Malays, Veddas, and 
Burghers—labeling them as distinct “races.” 
She found that the census served as the basis 
for determining race-based representation in 
the colonial state, and political representation 
was initially distributed equally among 
selected racial groups.
Race came to signify not just physical traits 
but also assumed mental and behavioral 
characteristics—shaped by emerging racial 
theories in early 20th-century Europe. In Sri 
Lanka, 'ethnicity' was officially introduced 
only in the 1971 census, marking not a real 
shift, but a continuation of colonial thinking. 
'Race' was simply replaced by 'ethnicity'—a 
change in terminology, not in ideology. This 
reflects how colonial powers constructed 
identities, which were later adopted and 
reinforced by local political elites during post-
colonial nation-building.
Recent genetic studies also reveal striking 
similarities between Sinhalese and Sri 
Lankan Tamils. Linguistically, Sinhala has 
absorbed extensively from Tamil and Sanskrit. 
Culturally and religiously, too, there are 
overlaps—Sinhalese worship Hindu deities like 
Ganesha, Vishnu, Kali, and Murugan, and Sri 
Lankan Buddhism integrates Hindu practices. 
Claims of ethnic or cultural purity are thus 
largely arbitrary.
As Palestinian-American academic and 
literary critic Edward Said aptly observed: “No 
one can deny the persisting continuities of 
long traditions… but there seems no reason 
except fear and prejudice to keep insisting on 
their separation and distinctiveness as if that 
was all human life was about.”
Tamil politics must now liberate itself from 
rigid ethno-nationalist thinking. Nationalism 
manufactures a false unity through imagined 
identities. Whether Sinhala or Tamil, ethnic 
nationalism is an aberration—undemocratic 
and inhumane. Coexistence must instead be 
rooted in fraternity, equality, and social justice.
Ordinary people do not inherently follow 
nationalist ideologies. Their priorities are</p>

livelihoods, stability, and safety. Nationalism 
gains traction only when it appears to 
secure those needs—often through fear and 
misinformation.
Today, Tamil nationalist politics is in decline, 
especially with the rise of the National People’s 
Power (NPP). As I said earlier, during the 
Aragalaya, a new political consciousness 
emerged, particularly among youth. Many 
began to see ethnic politics as a tool long 
exploited by elites for power. The NPP 
capitalized on this by promoting unity 
and justice across communities. However, 
dismantling entrenched ethnic narratives will 
take time. The challenge ahead is to turn this 
political awakening into real reform.
This shift has unsettled Sinhala supremacists, 
as it threatens their ideological dominance. 
Simultaneously, Tamil nationalist parties—
having lost recent elections in the North and 
East—see this transformation as a threat to 
their survival. They are now uniting out of fear 
of political irrelevance.
The NPP, while committed to a non-racist, 
united Sri Lanka, must act on its promises. The 
civil and military institutions of the state were 
built on ethnocratic foundations. Reforming 
them is essential. Without meaningful 
structural change, there’s a real risk that ethnic 
politics will once again rise to fill the void.
In your view, how has the National 
People's Power (NPP) government 
performed in the months since coming 
to power, particularly in relation to 
the Tamil people who extended their 
support at the polls? Do you believe 
the NPP is adequately addressing the 
long-standing grievances of the Tamil 
community — or do you feel that, once 
again, the Tamil vote is being taken for 
granted?
I believe we need to assess the NPP’s 
performance not through an exclusively 
ethnic lens, but by critically evaluating its 
commitment to dismantling Sri Lanka’s 
entrenched ethnocratic state structure. 
While acknowledging the ethnocratic nature 
of the state, I would argue that invoking 
Tamil ethnic nationalism as a response is 
counterproductive.
My concern is that certain right-wing Tamil 
nationalist forces are now regrouping to 
discredit the NPP entirely. Rather than 
offering constructive criticism, they brand 
all southern political formations as “Sinhala 
parties” and urge Tamils to vote exclusively for 
“Tamil” parties.
From an inclusivist political perspective, 
I choose to engage critically—but not 
dismissively—with the NPP. The party came to 
power with promises of ethnic reconciliation, 
abolition of the executive presidency, repeal 
of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), 
and an economy rooted in social justice. It 
garnered support from Sinhalese, Sri Lankan 
and Malayaga Tamils, and Muslims who were 
eager to dismantle the entrenched political 
status quo.
Although often labeled a leftist force, the 
NPP is more accurately described as a social 
democratic party. Yes, it has fallen short on 
several key promises—but criticism must 
be tempered with historical and political 
awareness.
The JVP, the dominant political party within 
the NPP, has a complicated past. It once 
aligned with Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist 
forces, opposed the 13th Amendment, rejected 
the North-East merger, and resisted the</p>

Norwegian-led peace process. It uncritically 
supported the military during the war. Despite 
its Marxist origins, the JVP's practice often 
fused socialism with Sinhala nationalism.
Ironically, the LTTE also opposed the 13th 
Amendment and the peace process, albeit for 
different reasons. They aligned secretly with 
President Premadasa to fight the IPKF and 
later supported Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 2005 
presidential bid.
However, the JVP’s political vision began to 
evolve after the ouster of ultra-nationalist 
figures like Wimal Weerawansa and the 
formation of the NPP in 2019. The 2022 
Aragalaya movement was a turning point—it 
mainstreamed discourses on ethnic unity 
and social justice. The NPP embraced this 
moment, promoting a more inclusive political 
ethos. While remnants of Sinhala nationalism 
remain, branding the NPP a Sinhala 
supremacist party is both inaccurate and 
intellectually lazy.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pledged 
to complete the 2015 constitutional reform 
process by introducing a new constitution that 
promotes democracy and equality, devolves 
power, and reforms the parliamentary electoral 
system. The NPP’s public commitments 
to recognising Sri Lanka’s multiethnic and 
multireligious character, and to safeguarding 
linguistic, cultural, and religious freedoms, are 
steps in the right direction. But rhetoric must 
translate into action.
Repealing the PTA was a central campaign 
promise. With a two-thirds majority, it 
should be achievable. Prime Minister Harini 
Amarasuriya has acknowledged that the PTA 
should be abolished. President Anura also 
stated clearly in a recent interview that repeal 
is forthcoming. Yet, after the NPP came to 
power, individuals continued to be arrested 
under the PTA. In March 2025, Mohamed 
Rusdi was detained under the Act for allegedly 
pasting a sticker critical of Israel. Authorities 
justified it by claiming he held extremist views. 
In a global climate of protest against Israel’s 
actions in Palestine, detaining Rusdi for an 
anti-Israel sticker resembles an Orwellian 
“thought crime.” He was later released on 
bail, but the incident casts doubt on the NPP’s 
reformist credibility.
Of course, the NPP inherited a repressive and 
corrupt state apparatus. Dismantling it will 
not happen overnight. However, symbolic and 
substantive gestures—like repealing the PTA 
or announcing a phased demilitarisation of 
the North and East—can foster trust among 
Tamils and other minorities.
The global context cannot be ignored. We are 
witnessing the ascent of hard-right ideologies: 
Trumpism in the U.S., neo-Nazi movements 
in Europe, Hindutva in India, Zionist violence 
in Gaza, and Putin’s ethno-nationalism in 
Russia. In this climate, Sri Lanka’s departure 
from racist authoritarianism—reflected in the</p>

electoral defeat of the Rajapaksas and Ranil 
Wickremesinghe—is meaningful.
Chile offers a useful comparison. After decades 
of neoliberalism, its 2019 student-led uprisings 
led to the formation of the broad progressive 
alliance Apruebo Dignidad and the election 
of Gabriel Boric. Though their proposed 
constitution was rejected, the movement 
disrupted hegemonic narratives. Similarly, 
Aragalaya challenged Sri Lanka’s corrupt elites, 
neoliberalism, and ethnocracy—marking a 
paradigm shift.
Yet, Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism remains 
largely unchallenged. If the NPP truly wishes 
to fulfil Aragalaya’s vision, it must form a 
broader progressive alliance to tackle both 
neoliberalism and the ethnocratic state 
structure.
Back in 2009, after the LTTE's defeat, some 
predicted a democratic opening. I was 
skeptical—foreseeing instead the deepening 
of a militarized and politicized state. Under 
the Rajapaksas, that pattern only intensified. 
Today, NPP leaders have acknowledged past 
state violence, enforced disappearances, and 
ethnic discrimination. That acknowledgment 
is important—but it must lead to concrete, 
accountable action.
President Anura and Prime Minister 
Harini have won the trust of people across 
communities. They are charismatic and appear 
genuinely committed to public expectations. 
Particularly in the North and East, Tamils 
have shown a willingness to listen—attending 
meetings and engaging with the leadership. 
This is a valuable opportunity to turn promises 
into policy.
Demilitarisation of the North and East is 
essential. It won’t happen overnight—but 
the NPP must articulate a clear, time-bound 
roadmap.
In sum, the NPP deserves critical but 
conditional support from all democratic 
forces. As Chilean President Boric said, 
countering extremism requires “ideology, 
conviction, less rhetoric, and more concrete 
actions that improve people’s quality of life.”
Let us hold the NPP accountable—not to 
weaken it, but to push it toward fulfilling the 
hope it inspired.
What do you think is the way forward? 
Do you think that the Tamils have the 
right to self-determination? If not what 
is the solution?
Let me address the issue of self-determination. 
As I mentioned earlier, self-determination, 
when linked to national liberation struggles 
against colonialism, had an inclusive character 
despite its limitations. However, during the 
post-colonial nation-building process, the 
rights of minorities were ignored, leading 
them to assert their right to self-determination 
and, in some cases, secession.
In Sri Lanka’s political and practical context, if 
Tamils assert their right to self-determination 
as a distinct nation, a critical question arises: 
what about minorities within that proposed 
Tamil nation—such as Muslims, Sinhalese, 
and Veddas in Tamil-majority areas? Likewise, 
in the South, do Tamils, Malays, Bohras, 
Burghers, Muslims, and Hill Country Tamils 
have the same rights? Where does this path 
of fragmented self-determination lead, and 
who has the authority to define nationhood? 
Should population size disqualify smaller 
groups like the Malays from being recognized 
as distinct nationalities?
There are about 600 linguistic communities 
and 5,000 ethnic groups in the world. If 
every community claimed the right to self-
determination and secession, there would</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

be 5,000 exclusive states. Is it possible and 
practical to establish separate states for each 
ethnic group?
For instance, when drawing the border for 
a new nation, what happens to those living 
on the border between the old state and the 
newly formed one? Will they be included or 
excluded? Will they be granted political rights? 
Do they have the choice to be part of the new 
state or remain in the old one?<br />
Daniele Archibugi, an Italian political 
theorist, argues that the principle of self-
determination is evolving into a new form 
of tribalism, reinforcing some of the most 
reactionary tendencies in contemporary 
society. Sri Lanka’s decades of war, destruction, 
militarization, and ethnic divisions have 
provided painful lessons on the dangers of this 
approach.
In the Sri Lankan context, approximately 
30% of Sri Lankan Tamils live in the South. 
Although a significant portion of Muslims 
reside in the East, more than 70% of them 
live in the South. Similarly, Malayaga Tamils 
are not confined to the Malayagam but also 
live in Colombo and other cities. Sri Lanka 
is a multicultural, multi-religious society, 
and territorial divisions based on ethnicity 
are neither practical nor sustainable. Such 
divisions are not only unrealistic but also 
dangerous, as they risk leading to further 
fragmentation and regression.
In the global context, the Palestinian struggle 
is widely recognized as a fight against settler 
colonialism and imperialism, and thus 
carries a progressive dimension. However, 
prominent activists and intellectuals—such 
as the late Edward Said—did not support 
the two-nation solution, despite Israel being 
classified as an apartheid settler-colonial state. 
Said noted the absence of a shared concept of 
citizenship among both Jewish and Palestinian 
communities. He argued that any solution 
should not be based primarily on ethnic or 
racial identities, but rather on the principles 
of equal rights, social justice, and peaceful 
coexistence as citizens of a unified Palestine.
Sri Lanka is neither an apartheid state nor a 
settler-colonial state. There has been a long 
history of coexistence, albeit with disputes.<br />
Although the modern nation-state building 
promoted an ethnocratic state, there is room 
for coexistence and peace. In the recent 
elections, people overwhelmingly voted for the 
NPP without regard to ethnicity or religion.
This creates a relatively more favorable 
environment for building a truly democratic 
society—one in which leftist, democratic, 
and progressive forces from all communities 
can work together toward that goal. The 
abolition of the Executive Presidency and 
the establishment of meaningful power-
sharing mechanisms are essential steps in that 
direction. However, power-sharing should not 
be based on ethnicity or religion, as doing so 
risks reinforcing ethno-nationalist politics and 
deepening existing divisions.
To conclude, I quote Marx: "The tradition 
of all dead generations weighs like an Alp 
[mountain] on the brains of the living." As 
Marx said, if you need to learn a new language, 
instead of translating it back to your mother 
tongue, embrace the spirit of the new language 
without constantly recalling the old.
