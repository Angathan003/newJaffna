Lankeswaran Sivarasa
Rajaputhiran Sivarasa
Lankeswaran and Rajaputhiran:
The Brothers Behind 
Achchuthan's Syndicate
Peupliers, Apt 2, Dourdan (Essonne). He was the first 
in his family to officially join the LTTE and undergo 
armed training. Lankeswaran is the fourth child in 
his family and attended Tellippalai Mahajana College, 
where he completed his O-Level exams in 1991, 
achieving six Ds and one C. However, he skipped his 
music practicals, as he had already committed to the 
LTTE by December 1991.
Credible sources indicate that the Sivarasa family's 
association with the LTTE began when the organization 
established a base at the Alaveddi Ashramam, near the 
Kumpilavalai Pillayar Temple in Alaveddi. This base 
was led by LTTE fighter Mathi, and the presence of the 
LTTE in the area naturally attracted young recruits like 
Lankeswaran.
A former classmate from Mahajana College described 
Lankeswaran as intelligent and capable. Another source 
noted that when Lankeswaran joined the LTTE, he was 
already in a relationship with Suganthiny, his future 
wife, whom he married on May 1, 2003, in Colombo. 
Within LTTE ranks, Lankeswaran was known by the 
alias "Thileepan."
One of Lankeswaran's former training mates recalled a 
memory from the LTTE's Old Park camp, where recruits 
were required to disclose details about their personal 
relationships. Lankeswaran mentioned Suganthiny from 
Pannalai village as his girlfriend, noting that while she 
was from the same batch, she was slightly older than 
him by a few months. When asked why he joined the 
A
n important member of 
Achchuthan's network is his 
younger brother, Lankeswaran 
Sivarasa, born on November 
18, 1975, and now residing at

Former Prime Minister's Secretary, K. Balapatabendi , being welcomed by then LTTE Political Wing Head, S.P. Tamilselvan. 
Also present are Ravi (extreme left) and Dominic (second from left).
LTTE despite being in a relationship, a former 
comrade jokingly remarked, "He made sure 
that, even in the LTTE, he wasn't about to be 
bitten by an ant.
This sentiment was echoed by another LTTE 
leader, who confirmed that Lankeswaran 
strategically placed himself in the political 
wing, far from the front lines, ensuring he 
stayed safe. Another source within LTTE 
ranks shared a humorous incident to counter 
Lankeswaran's current chest-thumping war 
stories often told to naive diaspora Tamils. 
According to this source, Lankeswaran's 
commander once discovered that he rarely 
used his revolver, and to his shock, a bee's 
nest had formed inside the barrel. "The 
commander," the source recalled, "was bloody 
furious!"
Following his training, Lankeswaran was 
appointed as the personal bodyguard to 
Anjaneyar, a prominent LTTE figure, and head 
of the political wing in Jaffna. He served in 
this role through several leadership changes,

leadership of Col. 
Shankar, each LTTE 
sector was given the 
opportunity to nominate 
recruits. From the 
Jaffna political division, 
both Lankeswaran and 
Kushanthan, the LTTE's 
communications officer 
at the Kondavil political 
office—who rose to 
become the Air Tigers' 
deputy chief before being 
arrested by Malaysian 
police and deported to 
Sri Lanka in 2014—were 
selected to join the air 
force initiative.
Other notable figures 
from Jaffna included Col. 
Roophan, a Jaffna Hindu 
College alumnus who 
became a member of the 
LTTE Air Tigers' suicide 
guard and was killed in 
a kamikaze-style attack 
on the Sri Lankan Air 
Force in 2009; Suresh, 
who went on to marry 
Achchuthan's sister, 
Sumithirathevi; and 
including during Dominic's tenure overseeing the LTTE's 
political division in Jaffna. When Anjaneyar was later assigned to 
lead the Makkal Uravu Kolkai Munneduppu (People's Relations 
and Policy Initiative), a public relations team named by language 
enthusiast Baby Subramaniyam, Lankeswaran remained by his 
side.
Another senior member from Lankeswaran's unit told Jaffna 
Monitor that, although Lankeswaran had joined the LTTE, he 
lacked the fiery passion of a true freedom fighter. Instead, he 
described him as “just a guy who went around grinning”  (Rk;kh 
rpupr;R nfhz;L ,Ue;jtd;).

airstrip buildings.
While Lankeswaran's wife, Suganthiny, and their two 
daughters obtained visas for France, he was unable to do 
so. French authorities placed him on an exclusion list—a 
designation reserved for individuals deemed security risks 
or potential threats to public order. Additionally, his name 
appeared on an Interpol watch list, further prompting 
French authorities to deny his visa due to these security 
concerns.
Another key ally within Achchuthan's network is his 
youngest brother, Rajaputhiran. Described by sources 
familiar with him as a rough, emotionless individual and a 
computer expert, Rajaputhiran was born on September 17, 
1982, in Jaffna and now resides at 27 Allée de la Loire, Saint-
Pathus (Seine-et-Marne), France. He was an LTTE member 
who served in the political division and trained under S. 
P. Thamilselvan, the then-head of the LTTE political wing. 
Known within LTTE ranks by the alias "Bharathi," he was 
the second in the family to undergo formal training (we 
apologize for mistakenly reporting him as a non-LTTE 
member in our previous issue).
Rajaputhiran was wounded in the final stages of the war, 
and credible sources suggest that he did not surrender to 
the military. Instead, they report that, due to his injuries, he 
was transported from an ICRC ship into an army-controlled 
area, where he registered as a civilian. Following the brutal 
end of the war, he subsequently escaped to France.
Rajaputhiran now holds permanent residency in both the 
UK and France. Primarily residing in the UK, he is actively 
involved in his brother's syndicate and is married to a French 
citizen.
Samraj, a relative of Achchuthan 
now residing in London, known 
for a battle injury that left him 
with speech difficulties.
Though Lankeswaran did not 
undergo formal pilot training, 
sources report that he pursued 
studies in aerospace engineering 
in Thailand and Malaysia, 
bringing valuable technical 
expertise to the LTTE's air 
operations.
Sources say that Lankeswaran's 
wife, Suganthiny, was also one 
of the engineers involved in 
drafting plans for the LTTE's

While their parents lived with Achchuthan's 
younger sister, Sumithirathevi, also known 
as Sumithi, sources indicate that Achchuthan 
frequently traveled to London. There, he met 
with Dr. Vaman—one of his key operatives—and 
his brother-in-law, Pugalenthi, who is reportedly 
hiding in London.
Credible sources within the LTTE administration 
told Jaffna Monitor that during the peacetime 
in the early 2000s, Achchuthan and his family 
members obtained land from the LTTE and built 
houses near the LTTE's court in Kilinochchi, 
which now functions as the Kilinochchi court. 
Land was allocated for both Achchuthan and his 
sister, Arunmozhi, and they constructed houses 
on these plots. Sources indicate that another 
plot was allocated in the name of Suganthiny—
Lankeswaran's wife—near their property.
Credible sources from the Kilinochchi Land 
Department confirm that these lands, initially 
allocated by the LTTE, remain 
registered under the original owners. 
It is reported that when Achchuthan's 
sister Arunmozhi visited Sri Lanka last 
year, she went to inspect this property. 
A former LTTE fighter expressed his 
frustration to Jaffna Monitor, stating, 
"While thousands of former fighters 
have no land and live in utter poverty, 
these people live lavishly in France yet 
still hold onto their land here."
