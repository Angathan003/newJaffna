of the LTTE abroad. The supermarket building also doubles as the 
hub for their cyber operations. From this location, Achchuthan 
and his brother Ilangeswaran coordinate online attacks and 
manage digital operations, collecting funds in the name of Tamil 
Eelam.
From this base, Achchuthan and his team maintain strong 
connections with members of the LTTE's foreign branches and key 
diaspora networks, furthering their influence and activities abroad.
Thiruppathi 
Supermarket: 
The Nerve 
Center of 
Achchuthan's 
Operations
According to credible 
sources, Thiruppathi 
Supermarket—now 
operating under the 
name Coccinelle 
Supermarché—serves 
as the nerve center for 
Achchuthan and his 
team's operations.
Interestingly, 
Thiruppathi SARL 
was registered under 
Achchuthan's real name, 
Sivarajah Pirunthapan, 
who is listed as the 
official owner. The 
owner's address provided 
for the registration is 6 
A Rue Rognon, 27950 
La Chapelle Longueville, 
France.
Achchuthan's younger 
brother, Lankeswaran 
Sivarasa, is married to 
Suganthiny Rajaratnam, 
a civil engineering 
graduate from the 
University of Peradeniya 
and an alumna of 
Mahajana College, 
Tellippalai. Born in 
Legal documents showing that Thiruppathi Supermarchés et Hypermarchés was 
registered under Pirunthapan Sivarajah, also known as Achchuthan</p>

July 1975, Suganthiny plays a key role in the operations of 
Thiruppathi Supermarket. She held a shareholding position in 
the business, actively managing its day-to-day operations while 
maintaining an ownership stake in the venture.
While her husband, Lankeswaran, was sent abroad by 
the LTTE during the peace period to study technology, 
Suganthiny—who married him in May 2003 in Colombo—
accompanied him to Malaysia. There, she worked as an 
engineer at Avcom Design Solutions from 2007 to 2014.
During her tenure at Avcom Design Solutions in Selangor, 
Malaysia, Suganthiny specialized in AutoCAD design work for 
a telecommunications company. Her responsibilities included 
developing technical designs and layouts essential to the 
company's projects across Malaysia.
A visitor to the supermarket shared a revealing observation: 
the workforce consists of 15 to 20 employees, all Sri Lankan 
Tamils, many of whom are former LTTE guards. Most of these 
workers are reportedly undocumented, lacking proper work 
permits, and are exploited with low wages, their vulnerable 
status leaving them at the mercy of the management.

A credible source who previously worked 
with Achchuthan provided further insight 
into the supermarket's hidden agenda: "If you 
go downstairs," the source revealed, "you'll 
find a concealed world—Tiger flags, LTTE 
propaganda materials, books, and notices 
scattered everywhere. It's as if time stopped for 
the LTTE here. Stepping into that basement 
feels like entering a space still firmly under 
Tiger's control."
In addition to Thiruppathi Supermarket, 
Achchuthan oversees a network of multiple 
businesses, supermarkets, and restaurants, 
many of which were once integrated into 
the LTTE's financial network. His web of 
enterprises spans across France and other 
countries, with operations sustained through 
a tight-knit group of associates and family 
members, each playing a pivotal role in 
maintaining and expanding the businesses.
Diversity Cuisine: A 
Culinary Facade for Covert 
Operations
Though Achchuthan was a skilled pilot with 
a Private Pilot License (PPL) from DGAC, 
France, and an Agent de Trafic certification 
from Aeroform International, he also excelled 
as a restaurateur and chef. His aviation studies 
were concealed under a cover story of hotel 
management studies. A credible source 
reveals he attended the Singapore Institute of 
Hospitality and completed HACCP training at 
CCI Évreux, a French chamber of commerce 
offering professional programs.
Achchuthan and his wife, Sakalya, founded 
Diversity Cuisine on August 18, 2015, in 
the Galerie Marchande at Carrefour, located 
at 5 Boulevard Isambard, 27200 Vernon, 
France, adjacent to the bustling Carrefour 
hypermarket. Vernon is a charming historical 
town nestled along the scenic banks of the 
Seine, situated halfway between Paris and 
Rouen, far from areas with significant Tamil 
populations. The restaurant enjoys a prime 
location, just 10 minutes from the nearest 
railway station, making it easily accessible to 
travelers and locals alike.
Staying true to its name, Diversity Cuisine 
showcases an eclectic selection of dishes 
from around the world, attracting food lovers 
from far and wide. As one enthusiastic visitor 
described it: "From India to Japan, from Texas 
to Brussels—this is the kind of culinary journey 
every foodie dreams of!"
Established as a Société à responsabilité 
limitée (SARL), Diversity Cuisine holds the 
following legal credentials:
• SIREN: 812 832 855
• SIRET (head office): 812 832 855 00017
• RCS registration: Registered at the 
Evreux registry on August 12, 2015
• Registration with the RNE: Registered on 
August 12, 2015
• VAT number: FR57812832855
• RCS number: 812 832 855 RCS Evreux
• Share capital: €10,000
While the restaurant exudes a vibrant and 
inviting atmosphere, a more elusive story lies 
beneath the surface. Sivarasa Pirunthapan—
also known as Achchuthan, Pirunthapan 
Rajah, and Suresh—a fugitive reportedly 
evading Interpol, has found sanctuary in 
Vernon, using Diversity Cuisine as his 
front. Hidden in plain sight, he operates the 
restaurant with his wife, Sakalya, seamlessly 
blending his passion for gastronomy with 
covert efforts to foment unrest and violence in 
Sri Lanka, jeopardizing the lives of thousands</p>

of former fighters who now lead peaceful, 
innocent lives in the country. While his 
daughter, born in 2005, enjoys the privileges 
of a stable life, studying in high school and 
excelling as a competitive swimmer.
One of our sources, who visited the restaurant, 
reported being warmly welcomed by a man 
named "Raja," who introduced himself as 
the owner. However, our facial recognition 
expert later confirmed that "Raja" is, in fact, 
Achchuthan, who is reportedly evading 
Interpol.
Aathi and Sanjana: Businesses Fueling 
LTTE's Covert Operations Abroad
Another key associate of Achchuthan is 
Thananayagam Kamalanathan, also known 
by his alias Thileepan, a former LTTE 
fighter. Kamalanathan is married to Shobana 
Kamalanathan, the sister of Suganthiny (the 
wife of Lingeswaran, Achchuthan's brother). 
Kamalanathan holds leadership positions in 
two significant ventures—Aathi and Sanjana—
both closely linked to LTTE operatives. 
Shobana also holds shares in Sanjana, further 
reinforcing the network's familial connections.
Born in 1979 in Ramanathapuram, 
Kilinochchi, to Mr. and Mrs. Thananayagam 
and Thilgavathy (née Mandaithivu Chinniah), 
Kamalanathan's deep-rooted ties to the LTTE 
continue to shape his activities and influence.
Kamalanathan oversees Aathi, a wholesale 
business registered under the official name 
Thisho Exotique d'Ivry SARL, located at 14 
Rue Pierre Rigaud, 94200 Ivry-sur-Seine, 
France. This venture serves as both a trading 
hub and a covert center for LTTE activities, 
playing a crucial role within key Tamil 
diaspora networks.
Founded on February 26, 2020, Aathi 
specializes in the wholesale trade of domestic 
goods under NAF/APE code 46.49Z. In 
2022, it was classified as a small or medium-
sized enterprise (PME). The company 
initially operated from Moissy-Cramayel but 
relocated its headquarters to Ivry-sur-Seine on 
September 12, 2023.
It operates under SIREN 881 940 639 and 
VAT number FR71 881 940 639. Beyond 
commerce, Aathi provides logistical support 
for Achchuthan's network, aiding efforts to 
Sivarasa Pirunthapan, also known as Achchuthan, at his Diversity Cuisine restaurant in Vernon, France</p>

Notably, Achchuthan served as both a 
shareholder and former director of Aathi, 
further deepening the intrigue surrounding 
the company's operations.
Sanjana (Mini Market de Paris)
Sanjana, operating under the trade name Mini 
Market de Paris, is another venture managed 
by Kamalanathan. Located at 14 Avenue de 
Paris, 94380 Bonneuil-sur-Marne, France, it 
was established on April 16, 2018 and offers 
a wide range of products, including exotic 
goods, cosmetics, prepaid phone cards, ready-
to-wear clothing, and import/export services.
Sanjana focuses on the retail trade of general 
food products and is registered under NAF/
APE code 47.11B. It was formally listed with 
the Créteil Trade and Companies Register 
(RCS) on May 17, 2018.
Kamalanathan assumed leadership of Sanjana 
on June 11, 2024, further expanding his 
network of LTTE-linked enterprises. Before his 
tenure, the business was managed by his wife, 
Shobana Kamalanathan (née Rajarathnam), 
who played a pivotal role in the company's 
operations from 2018 to 2024. Ownership 
of Sanjana is equally split between Shobana 
Kamalanathan and Selvaruban Sujeeban, each 
holding 50% of the shares.
Born on March 26, 1982, in Jaffna, Shobana 
remains actively involved in the company's 
operations.

Lankeswaran's Handyman &amp; Equipments: 
A New Front for Hidden Agendas?
Much like Aathi, Sanjana serves more than just 
commercial purposes. The business is deeply 
intertwined with LTTE activities, functioning 
as a key hub within the organization's 
global operations. Its strategic importance 
underscores the persistence of LTTE elements

abroad, operating under the guise of legitimate businesses 
while pursuing covert objectives.
Lankeswaran's Handyman &amp; Equipments: A New 
Front for Hidden Agendas?
In March 2024, Sivarasa Lankeswaran, brother of 
Achchuthan, launched yet another proxy enterprise—
Handyman &amp; Equipments, a specialized construction firm 
operating under the legal structure of a SASU (Société par 
Actions Simplifiée Unipersonnelle). Officially founded on 
March 22, 2024, the company is headquartered at 27 Allée 
de la Loire, 77178 Saint-Pathus, France.
While Lankeswaran serves as the company's President, 
it is widely believed that his wife, Mrs. Suganthiny 
Rajaratnam—a civil engineering graduate from the 
University of Peradeniya—plays a critical role in managing 
the business. Handyman &amp; Equipments is classified under 
NAF/APE code 43.99C, signifying its expertise in general 
masonry and large-scale construction work. Operating 
within the artisan framework, the company adheres to the 
IDCC 1597 collective labor 
agreement, governing building 
enterprises with more than ten 
employees.
The company's fiscal year will 
conclude on December 31, 
2024.
