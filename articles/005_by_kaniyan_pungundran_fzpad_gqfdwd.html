O
n November 13, 1989, Patabendi Don 
Jinadasa Nandasiri Wijeweera—better 
known as Rohana Wijeweera, the fiery founder 
of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) 
and an ardent extreme-left nationalist—met 
a brutal and tragic end. The mastermind 
behind two bloody insurrections, in 1971 and 
1987, Wijeweera was subjected to inhumane 
torture before being executed in cold blood 
on the Colombo Golf Course. Some accounts 
even suggest that when he was cremated at a 
crematorium near Devi Balika Girls' School, 
he was still half-alive.
Exactly 35 years and one day later, the 
National People's Power (NPP)—a political 
alliance led by the JVP, whose members 
still regard Rohana Wijeweera as their 
ideological father—achieved a historic and 
groundbreaking victory. In an unprecedented 
feat, the NPP secured 159 seats and 61.56% of 
the national vote, surpassing all expectations. 
This election marked a watershed moment 
in Sri Lanka's political history, as it was 
the first time a party achieved a two-thirds 
majority in Parliament under the proportional 
representation system.

Despite securing only 42% of the vote in the 
presidential election less than two months ago, 
the NPP experienced a remarkable surge in 
support during this brief period. Moreover, the 
NPP engineered a dramatic shift, reducing the 
main opposition, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya 
(SJB), to just 40 seats.
Nationally, out of 160 electoral divisions, 
the National People's Power (NPP) secured 
victories in all but 9 divisions. What was 
most striking was the NPP's remarkable 
performance in the Tamil-speaking areas of Sri 
Lanka.
A Fatal Blow to Tamil Nationalism
In the context of Tamil Eelam and Tamil 
nationalism, the Vaddukoddai Resolution 
stands mighty and profoundly symbolic, 
adopted on May 14, 1976, by the Tamil United 
Liberation Front under the leadership of S. J. 
V. Chelvanayakam, with key proponents like 
Appapillai Amirthalingam in Vaddukoddai, 
Jaffna. It called for the creation of an 
independent Tamil Eelam, outright rejecting 
the Sri Lankan state.
This was a watershed moment in the modern 
history of Sri Lanka, marking the first formal 
demand for a separate state for the Sri Lankan 
Tamils. Before this, Tamil demands were 
limited to devolution of power or power-
sharing within a federal system. One could 
argue that the resolution, coupled with the 
state-sponsored violence against Sri Lankan 
Tamils in 1977 and 1983, fueled the rise of 
militancy and the ensuing two-and-a-half 
decades of bloody civil war.

9
days since the adoption of the Vaddukoddai 
Resolution, the Vaddukoddai electoral division 
has been won by a Sri Lankan nationalist 
party.
While the JVP identifies as a Marxist-Leninist 
movement, its historical trajectory reveals a 
staunch Sri Lankan nationalist stance, one that 
firmly rejected even the idea of devolution of 
power to Tamils. The party also engaged in 
bloody armed resistance against the Indo-Sri 
Lankan Accord of 1987, which established the 
13th Amendment to Sri Lanka's Constitution. 
This Amendment created the system of 
Provincial Councils, promising greater 
devolution of land and police powers to Tamil-
majority areas.
Not only in the Vaddukoddai electoral 
division, but across the 11 electoral divisions 
in the Jaffna District, the National People's 
Power (NPP) secured victory in 8 divisions. 
Remarkably, many of these wins occurred in 
areas long regarded as strongholds of Tamil 
nationalism. Furthermore, the NPP claimed 3 
out of the 6 seats in the Jaffna electoral district. 
marking the first time since Sri Lanka's 
independence in 1948 that a non-Tamil party 
has triumphed in the Tamil-majority Jaffna.
"This is the crown of our victory," declared 
Bimal Rathnayake, a prominent JVP member 
and newly appointed Minister of Transport, 
Highways, Ports, and Civil Aviation, reflecting 
on the NPP's historic success in Jaffna. As 
news broke of Jaffna being captured by the 
NPP, Rathnayake emphasized the significance 
of the moment in a post on X (formerly 
Twitter): "In Sri Lankan history, we have seen 
leaders who were loved by either the North or 
the South. However, for the first time, we are 
witnessing a leader—AKD—who is cherished 
by people from the North, East, South, and 
West. He is a leader embraced by all Sri 
Lankans, regardless of religion or ethnicity."
In Sri Lanka's Tamil-majority regions, the 
NPP's victory extended well beyond Jaffna,</p>

sweeping nearly all districts across the North 
and East. The sole exception was Batticaloa 
in the Eastern Province. Notably, the Vanni 
electoral district—including Mullaitivu, home 
to Mullivaikkal, the site where the bloody 
civil war ended and the LTTE leader met his 
demise—also fell to the NPP in a poignant 
twist of irony.
In Batticaloa, the Illankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK) retained its hold on the 
Kalkudah and Paddiruppu electoral divisions. 
However, the NPP still left its mark by 
winning the Batticaloa electoral division.
A closer analysis at the electoral division 
level reveals a remarkable shift in voting 
patterns across the North and East. Out of 
the 24 divisions in these regions, the National 
People's Power (NPP) emerged victorious in 
15. Overall, the NPP garnered 26.75% of the 
total votes in the North and East. For context, 
in the 2020 parliamentary election, the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA)—widely regarded as 
the torchbearer of Tamil nationalism—secured 
27.58% of the vote in these same regions.
If we consider the LTTE's once-claimed 
Tamil Eelam, encompassing the districts of 
Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, 
Mannar, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, 
and Puttalam, the NPP achieved a 
staggering victory, securing 18 out of the 36 
parliamentary seats. Notably, an additional 6 
seats were won by non-Tamil parties.
The NPP's victory extended beyond the North 
and East, decisively winning in other Tamil-
speaking areas, including the hill country 
spanning the Central, Southern, and Uva 
provinces. The results delivered a significant 
blow to traditional parties representing the 
Malaiyaha Tamil community. Notably, the 
NPP dominated the Nuwara Eliya district, 
famous for Sri Lanka's iconic tea estates. In 
this region the NPP secured five seats and</p>

captured nearly 42% of the vote share.
''Tamil political parties, long reliant 
on emotional nationalist slogans and 
manipulative rhetoric, have operated almost 
entirely in the realm of self-interest, betraying 
the very people who elected them. From secret 
dealings with the government—whether 
for bar permits or other personal favors—
they now face the consequences of failing 
to critically assess their political trajectory,'' 
noted a political observer.
"They thought they could fool the Tamils 
forever," another observer remarked, quoting 
Bob Marley's famous lyric: "You can fool some 
people sometimes, but you can't fool all the 
people all the time." The observer added, "For 
them, it's too late even for introspection."
AKD: THE TRUE THESIYA THALIVAR 
(NATIONAL LEADER)
The sheer popularity and admiration for Sri 
Lanka's current President, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake (fondly known as AKD), can only 
be captured through a Rajinikanth punchline 
from Sivaji: The Boss: Pera kettaale chumma 
athiruthilla! (Doesn't everything quake at the 
mere mention of my name?).
AKD, in every sense, has won the hearts of 
people across Sri Lanka, transcending barriers 
of caste, religion, ethnicity, and social status.
In Jaffna, where the National People's Power 
(NPP) secured three out of six MPs, voters 
often couldn't even name the NPP candidates. 
It was the magnetic love and admiration for 
AKD himself that drew their votes. Many 
voters, when asked by Jaffna Monitor about 
their choice, openly admitted they didn't 
know the candidates' names.
Take my fish vendor Akka, for example. When 
she told me she planned to vote for the NPP, 
I asked her which candidate she would give 
her preferential vote to. She shot back: "Is 
that what matters? I'm voting for President 
Thampi's (younger brother's) party!"
When I pressed her on why, her response was 
as simple as it was profound: "He looks like 
us—hardworking, honest, and genuine."
This genuine, unpretentious connection is 
what makes AKD stand out. They see him 
as one of their own, someone they can relate 
to, almost like family. AKD's journey from 
humble beginnings to the highest office in the 
country is a story that deeply resonates with 
the people, inspiring hope and trust in a way 
few leaders can.
From Promises to Action: NPP's 
Victory and the Road Ahead
On election day, Sri Lankan President 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake remarked that 
he anticipated "strong representation" in 
Parliament, adding that achieving a two-thirds 
majority was not a necessity. However, the 
voters had other plans.
This historic victory marks a seismic shift in 
the country's political landscape and positions 
President Dissanayake with the unprecedented 
advantage of governing without the need for 
allies or coalition partners to pass legislation. 
The NPP has already pledged to hold a 
referendum on drafting a new constitution, 
signaling its intent to fundamentally reshape 
the country's political and governance 
framework. This moment, brimming with 
possibility, could redefine Sri Lanka's future. 
But will these promises be fulfilled? That 
remains to be seen.</p>

Faith in AKD: North and East Await 
Action on Promises
A few days before Sri Lankans headed to 
the polls, AKD addressed a fully packed 
election meeting in Passaiyoor, Jaffna. 
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, the 
President acknowledged the changing political 
landscape on the peninsula. "We received 
just over 27,000 votes in Jaffna during the 
presidential election. This was because we 
did not convey our message effectively to the 
Tamil-speaking people. It was also because we 
did not work as hard in the North as we did in 
the [Sinhala-dominated] South," he admitted.
He continued, "Your turnout today shows 
that you are willing to place your trust in us. 
I invite all of you, the people of Jaffna, to join 
me in this effort to change the political culture 
of our country."
During his address, President Dissanayake 
made a bold and transformative promise: 
lands seized by the State during the war with 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
would be returned to their rightful owners.</p>

This commitment tackles one of the most 
pressing and long-standing demands of the 
Northern people.
Earlier, during a speech in Vavuniya, he 
declared his intention to end the prolonged 
detention of Tamil political prisoners, 
stating firmly, "According to the advice of 
the Attorney General, we will move forward 
with the release of these prisoners." His 
manifesto echoed these sentiments, pledging 
the abolition of oppressive laws, including the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
Further, Dissanayake promised during his 
campaign to conduct provincial council 
elections within a year and vowed to abolish 
the executive presidency, a long-debated and 
highly contentious issue.
Although he affirmed his party's support for 
implementing the 13th Amendment during 
a discussion with the Illankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK), he notably refrained from 
making such a declaration in public. Instead, 
at a recent event in Jaffna, AKD clarified his 
stance with characteristic candor, stating, "I 
am not here to barter the 13th Amendment in 
exchange for Tamil votes."
Now, with the overwhelming faith placed in 
him by the people of the North and East, it is 
time for President Dissanayake to translate 
these promises into action. Importantly, 
neither AKD nor his party requires external 
support to fulfill these commitments. With 
a commanding two-thirds majority in 
Parliament, they possess the power to enact 
transformative change independently.</p>

'Our Path Was Forced Upon Us: 
Tilvin Silva on Rewriting the 
JVP's Legacy
In an interview with The Hindu, 
Tilvin Silva, General Secretary of the 
JVP, challenged prevailing narratives 
surrounding the party's tumultuous 
past. "There is a wrong perception 
because our history was written by 
those who defeated us. Our path was 
not one we willingly chose; it was 
forced upon us," he explained.
"It was not [our] action, but a reaction 
from our end. If the [State's] repression 
was armed, so was [our] response."
Looking to the future, Silva expressed 
hope for a transformative moment in Sri 
Lanka's political landscape. He underscored 
that the current context provides an 
opportunity to rewrite the narrative. "We want 
to tell this story, not with words, but through 
our actions," he asserted. "The present context 
gives us the chance to do that."
Sri Lanka's Moment of Reckoning: Historic 
Challenges, Monumental Stakes
Sri Lanka, where it stands now, can only be 
described as being at a historic juncture. The 
country is grappling with its worst economic 
crisis since independence—or perhaps even 
earlier—and the sweeping social and political 
changes we are witnessing are intrinsically tied 
to this crisis.
"Had the economic crisis not unfolded, who 
would have thought the NPP would rise to 
power or that the North and East would align 
with a national party?" an observer mused.
With the poverty rate soaring to 25.9% and 
the World Bank projecting a modest 2.2% 
economic growth for 2024, Sri Lanka's fragility 
is evident. The immediate challenge lies in 
ensuring access to essential goods and services 
for its people. How the new government 
navigates these turbulent waters will not only 
test its resilience but also define the nation's 
trajectory. The stakes are monumental, and the 
people's expectations are even higher.
AKD has pledged to rewrite the narrative: 
to repay the country's debts, transform Sri 
Lanka's entrenched political culture, erase 
the divisions along ethnic lines to unify as Sri 
Lankans, and hold corrupt figures from past 
regimes accountable. These promises have 
struck a chord with a population yearning for 
justice and stability. Yet, they set a formidable 
bar, one that will demand vision, grit, and 
relentless determination to achieve.
The road ahead is steep, the burden heavy, 
but Sri Lanka's moment for reinvention has 
arrived. The question remains: will it rise to 
the occasion?</p>
