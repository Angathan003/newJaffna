M
. R. Narayan Swamy, the legendary 
journalist, needs no introduction. 
Born and raised in Delhi to Tamil-speaking 
parents, his interest—or rather his fate—with 
Tamil militants, particularly the LTTE, grew 
naturally. As an Indian, he is credited with 
writing some of the finest literature on the 
LTTE, surpassing even Sri Lankan authors.
In 1994, he published "Tigers of Lanka: 
From Boys to Guerrillas," a mammoth work 
detailing the LTTE's growth from a group 
of young militants to a sophisticated war 
machine. This book is often considered the 
unofficial biography of the LTTE.
In 2003, he wrote the unofficial biography 
of Prabhakaran, the LTTE supremo. While 
his first book was well-received by the upper 
echelons of the LTTE, his second book did not 
go over as well due to its critical elements.
After the LTTE's military annihilation in May 
2009, he published "The Tiger Vanquished: 
LTTE's Story" in 2010, which is essentially a 
collection of articles he had written.
Fast forward to 2024, after a hiatus of almost 
one and a half decades, our finest writer is 
coming out with his latest (which he says 
will be his last) book, likely titled "The Rout 
LTTE Turning Its Weapons Against 
the Tamil Community It Claimed to

Its Destruction:

of Prabhakaran." The key difference is that 
while his earlier works in 1994 and 2003 were 
written when the LTTE and its supremo were 
at their peak, and Prabhakaran was regarded 
by some as a reincarnation of the sun god, now 
the LTTE is done and dusted, and Prabhakaran 
is just a chapter in history.
We are privileged to feature an interview with 
M. R. Narayan Swamy in this issue as our cover 
story and the Jaffna Monitor is immensely 
honored that this is the first interview he is 
giving regarding his latest book, "The Rout of 
Prabhakaran."
How did your journey as a journalist 
begin, and what sparked your initial 
interest in Sri Lanka and the LTTE, 
considering your background as a 
Delhi-born, Delhi-settled journalist? 
Over the years, how did your tryst with 
covering the Sri Lankan conflict and 
the LTTE evolve?
I pursued my passion for journalism, which I 
had developed during my school years, in 1978 
at the age of 19, soon after graduating from 
Delhi University. When Sri Lanka became 
a major news story in 1983, most of the 
literature produced by Tamil militant groups 
was in Tamil. Naturally, not every journalist in 
Delhi could read it. Although I was born and 
raised in Delhi, I studied Tamil, my mother 
tongue, in school, though my command of the 
language was not as strong as that of Tamil 
speakers from Tamil Nadu or Sri Lanka.
Tamil militants were happy to converse in 
Tamil with journalists since not everyone 
from their ranks was comfortable in English. 
1984, I wrote to the LTTE in Madras (now 
Chennai) asking for their literature. I received 
some booklets and a letter from Nadesan, who 
promised to keep sending literature. However, 
he never did.
My interest in Tamil militancy deepened in 
the mid-1980s, which is also when I first met 
Prabhakaran in Delhi. Over time, I met many 
militant leaders at various levels. My first visit 
to Jaffna, Sri Lanka, took place in August 1987, 
the day the LTTE surrendered some weapons. 
Since then, I have visited Sri Lanka, including 
the north and east, dozens of times. Through 
reading and repeated interactions with various 
actors in Sri Lanka, I learned more and more. 
Knowing Tamil was of immense help.
Learning is a never-ending process. I must 
emphasize that Sri Lanka was never my main 
work; it became a passion. I primarily wrote on 
and edited issues related to India.
Based on your extensive research and 
interactions, what are your opinions 
on the positive aspects of Prabhakaran 
and the LTTE you observed?
Prabhakaran and the LTTE had both positives 
and negatives, which are easier to observe 
now with time. Irrespective of how one 
judges Prabhakaran, I am convinced it was 
his personality that kept the LTTE united and 
fighting fit for such a long time. Due to various 
factors, some more evident after his death, 
he exuded a charisma that was appealing 
and motivating to his followers. He had the 
ability to convey that he was willing to give 
his everything for Tamil Eelam; everyone 
was expected to do the same. His refusal to 
compromise, while it proved negative in the 
long run, played a positive role in the short 
run. I am not delving into Prabhakaran's 
negatives since your question is about his 
positives.</p>

In your first book, 'Tigers of Lanka,' 
you depicted the LTTE as an almost 
undefeatable force. How do you perceive 
the dramatic shift to their complete 
eradication, and what factors contributed 
most significantly to this change? How 
has this development altered your 
understanding and interpretation of the 
conflict and Prabhakaran's legacy?
I am not sure if I ever actually said that the LTTE 
was undefeatable. However, I was convinced 
for a long time that Sri Lanka would find it very 
tough to overcome the LTTE militarily. This 
impression was shared by significant sections of 
the Sri Lankan military and, by extension, the 
establishment in Colombo.
I did write that no solution to the ethnic tangle 
would be possible without Prabhakaran. In a way, 
I was proved right. If Sri Lanka had defeated the 
LTTE militarily but Prabhakaran had escaped, it 
would be widely believed that the war was still 
on, even if the war theater itself had gone silent.
In the weeks and days leading to his death in 
May 2009, this was indeed a major worry for 
the Sri Lankan military. Sarath Fonseka, 
then army chief, insisted that without 
knowing Prabhakaran was dead, it 
could not be deemed that the war had 
been won. If someone were to ask 
me to give a single-word reply to 
why Prabhakaran and the LTTE 
were destroyed, my answer would 
be: Prabhakaran.
Prabhakaran's inability to 
grasp the larger picture, his 
failure to unite Tamils who 
disagreed with him, his lack 
of knowledge of geopolitics,</p>

his nihilistic attitude, and his refusal to see 
the benefits of a negotiated settlement all 
contributed to the demise of what was once 
viewed as a never-say-die outfit. This forms the 
core of my forthcoming book.
In a way, this is also an immense tragedy 
because it has left the Tamil community in Sri 
Lanka almost on its knees post-2009. Former 
LTTE cadres admit this.
In the preface of your upcoming book, 
The Rout of Prabhakaran, you describe 
it as a 'post-mortem' of Prabhakaran, 
marking a significant departure from 
your earlier works. What motivated 
you to write this new book at this 
particular juncture?
My first book, Tigers of Lanka, on the origins 
and growth of Tamil militancy, was published 
in 1994. My unauthorized biography of 
Prabhakaran, Inside an Elusive Mind, followed 
in 2003, six years before he perished in battle. 
In 2010, I released my third book, The Tiger 
Vanquished: LTTE's Story, a collection of my 
news stories published over the decades, along 
with a comprehensive overview of the rise and 
fall of the LTTE.
Now, with 15 years having passed since 
Prabhakaran's death and with so much new 
information available and more emerging, I 
felt a political autopsy was needed. This new 
book will not be the last word on Prabhakaran, 
but I hope it adds to the understanding 
of his complex character and the Tamil 
struggle. If and when someone writes a fair 
and comprehensive biography of the Tamil 
struggle, I hope my books will prove useful in 
some ways.
How do you see the transition of 
Prabhakaran from a powerful figure to 
just a chapter in history, and what do 
you hope readers will take away from 
this post-mortem analysis?
It is a great tragedy that a man who once 
controlled a third of Sri Lankan territory and 
almost two-thirds of its winding coastline 
ended up in an area less than the size of a 
soccer field. This fact alone serves as a stark 
commentary on Prabhakaran and the LTTE.
The history of the LTTE is replete with 
immense sorrow, huge betrayals, tremendous 
disappointment, and vast human suffering. 
One may or may not admire Prabhakaran, but 
there are hard questions that need to be asked 
and answered. I have attempted to address 
these in my upcoming book. I am afraid my 
assessment will not paint a very admiring 
picture of the LTTE's founder leader. However 
unpleasant this may sound, the truth, as they 
say, is often bitter.
For your writings about the LTTE and 
Sri Lanka, including your first book, 
Tigers of Lanka (1994), and others, 
who among the 
Sri Lankans, 
especially 
Tamils, helped 
you?
Many Tamils in 
and from Sri Lanka 
have gone out of 
their way to help me 
when I wrote my 
books. I don't want 
to name those still

alive since they may or may not want it, but 
there is no harm in naming those who are no 
more. Among them, the late S. Sivanayagam 
stands out. He edited the Saturday Review 
weekly from Jaffna in the 1980s and was 
instrumental in my research for Tigers of 
Lanka. He pointed out the lack of published 
literature on the origins and growth of Tamil 
militancy in Sri Lanka.
He provided access to the entire bound 
volumes of Saturday Review at his Besant 
Nagar residence in Chennai. These volumes 
were a treasure trove of information, giving me 
a solid foundation in the events in Tamil areas 
during the 1970s and 1980s. He also guided 
me on which books to read to gain a deeper 
understanding of the subject.
Additionally, the late V. Balakumar, Shankar 
Rajee, and K. Pathmanabha provided me with 
valuable insights into Sri Lankan Tamil society 
and the LTTE. There were plenty of others, but 
many of them are still active in politics. I owe 
a lot to them and also to numerous ordinary 
Tamils who, in their own way, provided me 
with valuable nuggets that played a critical role 
in understanding the larger picture.
How do you respond to critics who 
argue that your earlier works may 
have romanticized the LTTE and its 
supremo?
Romanticized Prabhakaran and the LTTE?! I 
was never a fan of either, so how could I have 
romanticized them? In any case, Prabhakaran 
did so many amazing things, both positive and 
negative, that his actions spoke for themselves. 
There is no need to romanticize or demonize 
him.
Professionally, after more than four decades in 
journalism, I am still a reporter at heart. Good 
journalism does not believe in romanticizing 
a historical figure. Let me cite one example. 
While writing my first book, someone who 
knew Prabhakaran insisted that he sharpened 
his skills by shooting wild monkeys between 
their eyes. But not one other person confirmed 
this, so I dropped it. If I were romanticizing 
the man, I would have added this, and it may 
have become gospel truth over time.
Do you think Prabhakaran's vision for 
Tamil Eelam was Realistic, or was it 
fundamentally flawed from the outset?
My answer is based on the present. In 
retrospect, man is always wise. I am sure the 
Tamil community had a cause to fight for 
when it all began, even if some of the methods 
were questionable. It will be nearly impossible 
to pinpoint when this positive factor began to 
go astray.
Even if one assumes that the goal was 
realistic at one point, it ceased to be a realistic 
proposition later. But it does not matter what 
you and I think. Prabhakaran thought it was a 
realistic goal, so he went on and on. The rest, 
as they say, is history.
The first three Eelam wars ended with 
significant gains for the LTTE. Where 
do you think they went wrong in the 
fourth Eelam war Despite fighting the 
same Sri Lankan army?
I believe I have answered part of your question 
earlier. Nevertheless, I can add something. 
You may recall one of Lenin's famous writings: 
"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back." All 
leaders must know how to forge ahead and 
when to step back. Both are integral parts of a</p>

struggle. You cannot remain fixated on a single 
method.
In 2006, when Eelam War IV began, 
Prabhakaran had been fighting for 23 long 
years, discounting the years preceding 1983. 
Most of those who started off with him were 
either dead or had left. Looking back, how 
long could one go on and on? Yet Prabhakaran 
thought he could not only wage war again but 
win as well. This was a colossal miscalculation. 
In a way, Prabhakaran was a prisoner of his 
own seeming invincibility—an impression 
that many others also shared in Sri Lanka and 
beyond. The picture changed irrevocably from 
2008 onwards.
Did you ever imagine that the LTTE 
would turn its weapons against its own 
people, including forcibly conscripting 
young children and leading countless 
innocent Tamils to their tragic end at 
Mullivaikal in the final war? How do 
you explain this drastic downfall and 
betrayal of the Tamil cause?
The LTTE turning its weapons against the 
very community it claimed to represent was a 
significant crime that laid the foundation for 
its eventual destruction, even if this was not 
fully realized by many in the 1980s. Besides 
many innocent Sinhalese and Tamils, the 
LTTE killed innumerable Tamils—militants, 
moderates, and civilians—simply because they 
disagreed with the Tigers and Prabhakaran. 
In a way, the LTTE chief kept undermining 
himself in the long run.
I was told by credible sources that before</p>

the LTTE was destroyed, Pottu Amman, the 
intelligence wing chief of the LTTE, confided 
to some colleagues in the final days of the last 
war about three major blunders he felt the 
LTTE had committed. One of these was the 
large-scale and forced conscription of children, 
particularly from poor families, which left the 
helpless parents distraught and the children 
deeply unhappy. But the blunders the LTTE 
committed were more than what Pottu 
Amman admitted to. The question is: who 
made these blundering decisions? Surely, it was 
Prabhakaran.
What do you believe motivated 
Prabhakaran to provoke the 
government and start the war in 2006, 
despite the LTTE losing its eastern 
commander and 6,000 cadres? How 
do you think Prabhakaran convinced 
himself to initiate the conflict when the 
LTTE was militarily weakened?
This is a good question, but it is not easy to 
answer. Some of the replies above might help. 
That Prabhakaran still thought he could win 
despite losing almost the entire eastern wing of 
the LTTE speaks poorly of his understanding 
of military affairs.
The split in the LTTE was a boon for Colombo. 
Balasingham, certainly more mature than 
Prabhakaran, warned of disaster if the LTTE 
went to war again. However, most people in 
the higher echelons of the LTTE turned out to 
be 'yes men' who could not or did not want to 
persuade their leader to think differently. The 
end result was a monumental disaster.
What is your assessment of the key 
factors that led to the LTTE's downfall?
I think I have already explained this, but I will 
make one point here. Despite his limitations, 
Anton Balasingham desired that the Tamil 
Eelam campaign should see a positive end 
in his lifetime. This is why he was livid when 
the LTTE killed Rajiv Gandhi. He also had a 
far better understanding of global affairs and 
what the West and Asian countries like India 
and Japan desired regarding Sri Lanka. None 
of them wanted Sri Lanka to break up. The 
epoch-making events of 9/11 changed much 
of the world's thinking about terrorism and 
insurgency. Prabhakaran, however, lived in a 
world of his own
Do you believe that Sinhala hardliners 
have abandoned violent tactics 
towards Sri Lankan Tamils, especially 
in light of historical events such as the 
burning of the Jaffna Public Library 
and the pogroms of 1977 and 1983? 
Additionally, have you observed any 
positive initiatives or approaches by 
the Sri Lankan government towards 
the Tamil community in recent times?
When the Sri Lankan economy crashed, 
leading to Gotabaya's flight and widespread 
shortages, many ordinary Sinhalese felt this 
was karmic suffering for not raising their 
voices against government-induced shortages 
of essential goods in the north and east for 
a long time. This feeling reflects the changes 
in the Sinhalese psyche. However, there is no 
doubt that a quarter century of bloodshed 
has divided Sri Lanka into 'us' and 'them,' a 
situation that unfortunately persists among 
many. The so-called Sinhalese hardliners do 
not want to make any meaningful concessions 
because they foolishly believe this will be a 
stepping stone to Tamil Eelam. Unless this 
negative thinking changes, I don't see much</p>

hope for improving ruptured ethnic relations.
Many believe the Sri Lankan army 
won the war with the help of the 
Indian government and its tactical 
support. What do you think motivated 
the Indian government to provide this 
assistance?
I don't agree that Sri Lanka won the war with 
the help of the Indian government. With 
the kind of material help India was willing 
to provide, Sri Lanka probably could not 
have won the war, certainly not in 2009. The 
main military support for Colombo came 
from many countries, including Iran, Israel, 
Pakistan, and China. The dominant help 
from India and the US was in the field of 
intelligence, which was undoubtedly very 
valuable.
India also choked the sea link between Tamil 
Nadu and northern Sri Lanka towards the 
end of the war. As far as I know, the last LTTE 
boatload, ferrying medicines from Tamil Nadu 
to Prabhakaran's lair, went on May 8, 2009. 
Fifteen Black Tigers died in this effort, fighting 
the Sri Lankan Navy at sea.
Regardless of whether the Congress or the 
BJP ruled India, there was a consensus that 
Sri Lanka should not be allowed to break 
up. Also, remember that the most powerful 
person in India when the LTTE finally crashed 
was a woman who had been widowed by 
Prabhakaran in 1991 when he had Rajiv 
Gandhi killed.
As an Indian, how do you perceive the 
impact of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination 
on the LTTE and Sri Lankan Tamils' 
relationship with the mainstream? 
What were the implications of 
this senseless attack ordered by 
Prabhakaran?
Among the most foolish things the LTTE 
and Prabhakaran committed was the 
assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. If there was one 
act of Prabhakaran that Balasingham never 
forgave, it was this. More than anyone else, 
Balasingham realized the disastrous long-term 
consequences of this mindless action. All his 
fears proved absolutely correct. After initially 
denying that they were anyway involved in the 
gory killing, Prabhakaran finally admitted the 
truth to Balasingham. This one action totally 
and irrevocably breached whatever links the 
LTTE may have had or could in the future have 
had with the Indian State and, to a great extent, 
with the Indian people in general.
The reality is that Prabhakaran wanted to have 
the cake and eat it, too. He wanted to kill Rajiv 
Gandhi, and he believed that no one would 
be able to link it up with the LTTE. I will not 
hesitate to say that if the world finally turned 
against the LTTE dream of Tamil Eelam, then 
the Rajiv Gandhi assassination (and some 
other specific killings) was a key factor. And 
look at destiny: the woman Prabhakaran made 
a widow in 1991 was the most powerful person 
in India when the LTTE finally went down.
You could compare this assassination with the 
way Yasser Arafat went and hugged Saddam 
Hussein after the latter invaded and gobbled 
up Kuwait, losing forever the decades of 
invaluable financial and other support from 
the oil-rich Gulf countries. 
There are diverse opinions regarding 
Anton Balasingham's role within the</p>

LTTE. As the organization's chief 
theoretician, critics argue that despite 
his private disappointment with 
Prabhakaran's brutal actions-such as 
the assassinations of Rajiv Gandhi and 
Premadasa and numerous bombings-
Balasingham continued to serve as the 
LTTE's spokesperson until his unofficial 
suspension. Notably, he never publicly 
criticized Prabhakaran's methods. 
Critics contend that if Balasingham 
indeed disapproved, he should have 
left the organization but remained 
for personal benefits within the LTTE 
diaspora. From your responses, it 
seems you hold a high opinion of 
Balasingham. However, I may be 
wrong in my interpretation. Given 
these perspectives, how do you view 
Balasingham's role within the LTTE? 
Do you believe he was genuine in his 
political stance, or did he spend his 
life justifying Prabhakaran's 
violent tactics?
I have absolutely no special 
love or admiration 
for Balasingham or 
anyone else in the 
LTTE. While 
Balasingham 
may have 
had 
reasons for not leaving the LTTE, which 
can be easily speculated, he did not wait 
until just before his death to speak out 
against Prabhakaran. He had been critical of 
Prabhakaran to many people, including fellow 
Tamils and foreigners. As someone who had 
seen more of life and certainly understood 
international affairs better than Prabhakaran, 
he recognized the dangers of the path 
Prabhakaran was intent on pursuing.</p>

All the criticism leveled against Balasingham 
is justified. However, this does not diminish 
the truth he spoke, which led to differences 
with Prabhakaran at a certain stage. To my 
knowledge, Prabhakaran was aware that 
Balasingham was critical of him on some if 
not all, issues. Incidentally, I have discussed 
the issue of Balasingham in some detail in my 
upcoming book.
Thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils still 
live in refugee camps in Tamil Nadu 
and other states, with those who 
arrived as refugees and those born 
in these camps not being granted 
respect, citizenship, or identification, 
remain stateless. This situation starkly 
contrasts with other countries where 
Sri Lankan Tamils have migrated and 
become influential forces. Do you 
think this situation is right or morally 
acceptable?
I do not condone the state of affairs ordinary 
Sri Lankan Tamils find themselves in Tamil 
Nadu's camps. Morally, this is a very sad 
situation. Most Tamils from Sri Lanka now in 
the camps are from the lower strata of society, 
which makes their condition more pitiable.
However, do note that some known pro-
militants, including those who were with the 
LTTE, lead a normal life in Tamil Nadu and 
beyond. Unlike the West, which grants Tamils 
citizenship, I don't think India will do that.
India does not grant citizenship to the tens of 
thousands of Tibetans and Afghans who live in 
the country either.
The ethnic unrest initially began as a 
movement for Tamil liberation before 
evolving into the LTTE's struggle. 
Considering this historical context 
and acknowledging that the majority 
of Tamils believe the problems that 
drove them to take up arms remain 
unresolved, how do you view the 
current state of these issues?
Additionally, what do you believe the 
Sri Lankan government, the What 
should the Indian government and 
Tamil politicians do to address these 
unresolved issues?
A post-mortem, with a positive framework 
of mind, is needed from everyone. The Sri 
Lankan State must admit that it has committed 
many wrongs overtime against the Tamils. The 
Tamil leaders should put forward concrete 
ideas within a united or federal set-up (the 
terminology is not important) outlining what 
should be done for a better tomorrow. This 
discussion should not be limited to power-
sharing issues alone.
Major mistakes have been made on both sides 
of the ethnic divide, and there seems to be 
a culture of impunity on both sides. If there 
are said to be war criminals in the military 
(serving or retired), many of the LTTE fighters 
who surrendered and are alive can also be 
classified similarly. Colombo never apologized 
for the thousands of deaths of innocents 
during the JVP insurgencies, so it may be too 
much to expect them to do so regarding the 
Tamils.
India can and must assist in this process but 
without being interventionist.</p>

Can the LTTE ever re-emerge?
It cannot. The LTTE is dead and gone. The 
LTTE is not an electrical equipment that 
can be switched on or off at will. The LTTE 
and other groups emerged within a specific 
geopolitical framework at a certain historical 
juncture. There was a Prabhakaran (excluding 
other militant leaders for now) who provided 
shape and leadership to the group. The Tamil 
cause also enjoyed moral legitimacy in 1983. 
All of this no longer exists.
Prabhakaran is revered by many of 
his supporters and refuted by others. 
Considering both perspectives, what is 
your comprehensive assessment of his 
legacy and impact?
There could have been no LTTE without 
Prabhakaran. However, as I say, while he 
undoubtedly had leadership skills, he lacked 
some other qualities vital to lead a movement 
to a logical conclusion. It is good to revere a 
leader, even to glorify one, but a brazen refusal 
to accept criticism can never help. Mahatma 
Gandhi is India's Father of the Nation but is 
subject to many critical analyses in his country.
If you need to know the bottom line of 
Prabhakaran's legacy, you must talk to former 
LTTE guerrillas in confidence. One ex-woman 
fighter told me that the Tamils stood on their 
legs in 1983; a bloody quarter century later, 
they stare at an uncertain future. Is this why 
this war went on for so long and why so many 
thousands, combatants and non-combatants, 
perished?
Although the LTTE has been 
dismantled, the ideologies of the LTTE 
and its leader, Prabhakaran, which 
we can term "Prabhakaranism," still 
persist among the Sri Lankan Tamils...
This is a natural phenomenon. Mahatma 
Gandhi is no more, but Gandhism as an idea 
exists. But it does not have the same potency. 
One reason "Prabhakaranism," as you describe 
it, still exists is because a significant section 
of the society, either out of loyalty or fear or 
both, strongly believed in it, thinking for a 
long time that it would yield positive results. 
It turned out to be the opposite. It will be 
difficult for people who believed in the idea 
of Prabhakaran and Tamil Eelam to shun it 
overnight. But many have. Over time, the idea 
will lose potency. As more and more truth of 
whatever happened in the Tiger land over the 
years and decades comes out, more and more 
people will drift away. The hardcore supporters 
will remain, more outside of Sri Lanka and less 
within the island nation. 
What is your perspective on the role 
of the Tamil diaspora in the LTTE's 
operations and their ongoing influence 
in Tamil politics today?
The diaspora was the creation of the 1983 
pogrom and the subsequent Tamil insurgency. 
One Sri Lankan Tamil nationalist who was 
with Prabhakaran almost until the latter's end 
told me that the birth of a huge diaspora was 
perhaps the biggest gain of what is called the 
Sri Lankan problem.
It is a pity that dominant sections of the Tamil 
diaspora lived in the West and enjoyed its 
democratic space and opportunities but did 
not raise their voices against even the visible 
flaws of the LTTE and its excesses. It is possible 
they did not want to or could not afford the 
risk. Either way, the diaspora indirectly and</p>

unwittingly contributed, although they may 
not have wanted it. Of course, there were 
others who spoke against the LTTE and paid a 
price for their courage.
In hindsight, what could the Sri Lankan 
government have done differently to 
prevent the rise of the LTTE?
This is now an academic question. Sri Lanka 
had many opportunities to come to an 
understanding with moderate Tamil leaders 
in a bygone era, with some give and take. 
Looking back, some Sinhalese leaders were too 
narrow-minded.
They could have learned from the way different 
governments in India dealt at different times 
with what can be called the nationality 
question. India is not a perfect example, but it 
is not a bad example either.
What tips and guidance would you 
offer to young writers and Journalists 
in Sri Lanka who aspire to cover 
complex and sensitive Topics, much 
like you have done throughout your 
career?
As I said in the beginning, Sri Lanka was a 
passion and not my bread and butter. I have 
covered a variety of national and international 
issues, including the civil war in Nicaragua, 
the PLO National Council meeting in Jordan, 
the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and 
Rajiv Gandhi, the Bhopal gas disaster (at that 
time the world's worst industrial disaster), 
international events in India and abroad, the 
Indian prime ministers' visits abroad (among 
the toughest assignments), as well as numerous 
elections, political upheavals, communal 
strife, disasters, and more in India. I have met 
Yasser Arafat, the Dalai Lama, and US-based 
Khalistani leaders, besides top Indian political 
leaders. I have written widely on diplomatic 
issues.
I come from a simple middle-class family and 
don't have great academic credentials. I read 
constantly to keep myself up to date on various 
issues. My advice to young journalists is to 
keep working hard and seize every professional 
opportunity that comes your way with both 
hands. Do not be biased for or against anyone 
professionally; be humble and have empathy 
for the less privileged. A reporter should take 
pride in doing even the smallest of stories.
Anyone can commit an error (I have made my 
share of mistakes), but try your best to check 
and cross-check matters of importance. Also, 
learn as many languages as you can. Reading 
and exposure to other cultures will broaden 
your worldview.
Don't chase money. My monthly stipend 
when I took to journalism in 1978 was 400 
rupees. I survived because I lived with my 
parents. After eight years of slogging in UNI, 
my salary was a paltry 2,600 rupees. While in 
Bhopal for 16 days covering the gas disaster, 
our daily allowance was so meager that I could 
only afford lunch for 7 rupees, while most 
journalists from Delhi stayed in good hotels. 
We went daily to Hindu cremation grounds 
and Muslim burial sites to count the rising 
number of dead (as the government was not 
giving out figures) on cycle rickshaws. I saw 
money and comfort only after joining the AFP.
More than anything else, to succeed in life, you 
need the blessings of your parents, guru, and 
divinity. Pride and arrogance will cancel this 
out.</p>

n a sensational showdown at the Rangiri 
Dambulla Stadium, Sri Lanka's women's 
cricket team etched their names in history by 
securing their inaugural Women's T20 Asia 
Cup, triumphing over India by eight wickets 
in a riveting finale destined to be remembered 
for years. This victory, achieved with eight balls 
to spare, represents a monumental milestone 
in Sri Lankan cricket and establishes a new 
standard for the nation's women athletes.
Sri Lanka had previously reached the Asia 
Cup finals in five of the tournament's eight 
editions yet consistently fell short, losing all 
five finals to India. However, this time marked 
a departure from the past. Demonstrating an 
exceptional brand of cricket, the Sri Lankan 
women's team overcame a formidable Indian 
side, setting a new record for the highest 
successful chase in T20 Internationals for the 
team.
Set a target of 166, it initially looked like 
India's game. Sri Lanka had never chased such

a high total in T20 Internationals, let alone in 
a final. But the Sri Lankan women believed in 
themselves and completed a comprehensive 
win. The victory was orchestrated by captain 
Chamari Athapaththu's explosive 61 and 
Harshitha Samarawickrama's unbeaten 69. 
Kavisha Dilhari's all-round performance, 
including a crucial 30 not out off 16 balls.
India's formidable total of 165 for 6, led by 
Smriti Mandhana's 60, seemed daunting. Yet, 
Chamari Athapaththu's aggressive batting 
against India's left-arm spinners turned the 
tide. Her onslaught in the powerplay, which 
included two sixes and two fours off Tanuja 
Kanwar, set the tone for the chase. When 
Chamari was bowled by Deepti Sharma for 
61, it seemed like Sri Lanka might falter, as 
she had been the team's main match-winner 
for over a decade. But number three batter 
Harshitha Samarawickrama kept fighting. 
An unbroken 73-run partnership for the 
third wicket followed between Harshitha and 
Dilhari, as Sri Lanka pulled off a sensational 
win.
Harshitha Samarawickrama's composed 
innings proved pivotal after Chamari 
Athapaththu's departure. She capitalized 
on India's misfields and dropped catches, 
including a crucial one by Harmanpreet 
Kaur when she was on 45. Harshitha 
Samarawickrama was unbeaten on 69 off 51 
balls with six fours and two sixes. Kavisha 
Dilhari finished 30 not out, having faced 16 
balls with one four and two sixes. Dilhari's 
powerful hitting in the final overs ensured 
a comfortable win for Sri Lanka, sharing an 
unbeaten 73-run stand with Samarawickrama.
This win is expected to be a significant boost 
for women's cricket in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka 
Cricket announced a winning bonus of US$ 
100,000 for the team. Better match fees and 
endorsements from sponsors are likely to 
follow. More than anything, the win is sure to 
inspire more girls to take up the game. A full 
house witnessed the final, and many young 
girls would aspire to follow in the footsteps 
of Chamari Athapaththu or Harshitha 
Samarawickrama.</p>

The victory is a testament to coach 
Rumesh Ratnayake's transformative 
impact since his appointment in early 
2023. Under his guidance, Sri Lanka 
has seen significant improvements 
in performance and morale. His 
emphasis on a positive, cohesive 
environment and focus on "one ball 
at a time" has paid dividends, with Sri 
Lanka achieving notable victories in 
both T20Is and ODIs. Last year, the 
team won series in England and South Africa, 
apart from beating New Zealand at home.
Chamari Athapaththu's journey to this historic 
moment has been marked by perseverance 
and leadership. Holding the Asia Cup trophy 
amidst adoring fans, she symbolized the new 
era of Sri Lankan women's cricket. "That's 
over, now focus on the next thing," she said, 
embodying the team's forward-looking 
mentality.
As Sri Lanka revels in this monumental 
achievement, all eyes are on the future. With 
the T20 World Cup on the horizon in October, 
the team, invigorated by their historic victory, 
is determined to maintain their winning 
momentum. This triumph signifies a new 
era for Sri Lankan women's cricket, inspiring 
future generations to take up the sport. The 
roaring crowd at the packed Rangiri Dambulla 
Stadium, united in celebration, showcased 
the burgeoning support and recognition for 
women's cricket in the nation.</p>
