T
he Northern Province does without a doubt have a rich and 
proud history. Marred by turbulence from the late 70’s.The 
Jaffna Monitor has carried the related narrative previously.  The 
material in this piece quotes extensively from a Census Report. 
It does not attempt to interpret the contents. Suffice to say these 
numbers have been the subject of great emotions.<br />
ENUMERATION OF VITAL EVENTS 2011(ISBN 978-955-
577-779-7)

out by the DCS commencing 10thJune till 15thAugust 2011. The field data collection required

DEATHS AND UNTRACEABLE PERSONS
The EVE 2011 paid special attention to deaths and untraceable persons reported in the Northern 
Province during the last 3 decades since 1982. Family members reported details of deceased 
or untraceable persons when such death or intractability has taken place while they were still 
members of the family and the basic information gathered at district level are shown in table 
3.1.12.
Table 3.1.12: Deaths and untraceable persons by district reported from 1982 to July 2011
EVE 2011 recorded 71,201 cases of deaths/ untraceable persons reported by respondents in the 
entire Northern Province since 1982. Nearly 5% of the cases were partly responded due to the 
sensitiveness of the status in question and due to various other reasons unstated or not known.

Truth and Reconcilition
Arriving at the truth around tragedies 
that touched the persons requires a 
process discussed ad nauseum. A recent 
commentary by Prof. GL Pieris called for:
Territorial Application
There is a crucial difference in this 
regard. The mandate in South Africa 
embraces the whole nation without 
qualification (Preamble and section 
3 of Act No. 34 of 1995). By contrast, 
the proposed mandate in Sri Lanka is 
operative throughout the Island, but only 
where the atrocities in question “were 
caused in the course of, or reasonably 
connected to, or consequent to the 
conflict which took place in the Northern 
and Eastern Provinces during the period 
1983 to 2009, or its aftermath” (section 
12(i)). </p>

Structural Framework
The South African legislation envisages three 
committees specifically established alongside the 
Commission—the Committee on Human Rights 
Violations, the Committee on Amnesty and the 
Committee on Reparation and Rehabilitation. 
Each of these Committees has a statutory 
mandate and function, the role of each being 
clearly defined in relation to the Commission.
The Sri Lankan Bill is much less precise 
and clear-cut. The corresponding provision 
empowers the Commission to appoint panels 
consisting of not less than 3 members, the 
members being assigned to panels by the 
Chairperson of the Commission (section 7(2)). 
Unlike in South Africa, there is no indication 
of either the number of panels or the subject 
matter entrusted to each panel. A tighter 
conceptual scheme, with an explicit definition 
of identity and scope, is desirable at this 
conjuncture.</p>

Reconciliation and the Judiciary
Investigation which the Commission in Sri 
Lanka is authorized to undertake encompasses 
a wide range of activity including “extrajudicial 
killings, assassinations and mass murders” 
(section 12(g) (i)), “acts of torture” (section 
12(g) (ii)) and “abduction, hostage taking 
and enforced disappearances” (section 12(g) 
(IV)). These are grave crimes in respect of 
which proceedings are instituted before 
the regular courts. In this event, should 
judicial proceedings, of a civil or criminal 
nature, be suspended until conclusion of the 
Commission’s investigations, or vice versa, or 
should they take place concurrently?
This is a matter of obvious practical 
importance that receives detailed consideration 
in South Africa, but not at all in Sri Lanka. For 
instance, where the person seeking amnesty 
before the relevant Committee in South Africa 
has a civil action in court pending against him, 
he may request suppression of the proceedings 
pending disposal of the application before 
the Committee (section 19(6)). The court 
may, after hearing all relevant parties, accede 
to this request. Similarly, a criminal action 
may be postponed in consultation with the 
Attorney-General of the relevant Province. 
These provisions serve the salutary purpose of 
averting the risk of conflicting orders by the 
courts and a Committee of the Commission 
in simultaneous proceedings. The Sri Lankan 
Bill fails to make any provision against this 
unacceptable contingency.
Protection and Compellability
Discovery of truth requires the compulsory 
attendance of witnesses and the production 
of evidence before the Commission or its 
delegate. There is an equally critical need, in 
subsequent proceedings, to protect witnesses 
against incrimination by testimony obtained 
through compulsion. These are competing 
objectives which need to be reconciled 
equitably.
This is achieved by the South African 
legislation: a person will be compelled to 
answer or produce evidentiary material 
having the potential to incriminate him, 
only if the Commission is satisfied that this 
course of action is “reasonable, necessary and 
justifiable” (section 31(2)). Moreover, the vital 
proviso is attached that the incriminating 
answer or evidence is inadmissible in criminal 
proceedings against the person providing it. 
This is a satisfactory result.
The position in Sri Lanka is quite otherwise. 
There is provision for the Commission to 
summon any person or to procure material 
(section 13(t) and (u)). This exists side by side 
with provision empowering the Attorney-
General “to institute criminal proceedings 
in respect of any offence based on material 
collected in the course of an investigation by 
the Commission” (section 16(2)). Vulnerability 
is enhanced by the removal of protection 
conferred by the Evidence Ordinance (section 
13(y)). In stark contrast with the position in 
South Africa, there is a singular absence of 
any provision against self-incrimination in Sri 
Lanka.
Amnesty
The basic purpose of Truth and Reconciliation 
Commissions around the world is to enable 
victims to come to terms with a deeply scarred 
past and to face the future with dignity and 
self-assurance. This is the gist of the Greek 
concept of Katharsis, or the purging of the 
soul. Through full and candid disclosure, 
involving unburdening and relief, comes the 
expiation of guilt.</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com

This is the context in which the idea of 
amnesty occupies a central place in the scheme 
of reconciliation. The Committee on Amnesty 
is the centerpiece of South African legislation. 
The primacy of its function is underlined 
by the provision that “No decision, or the 
process of arriving at such a decision, of the 
Committee on Amnesty shall be reviewed by 
the Commission” (section 5(e)). The status 
of this Committee is unique, standing as it 
does apart from, and indeed above, the other 
Committees. An application for amnesty 
succeeds in South Africa if there is genuine 
contrition manifested in complete disclosure 
of all relevant facts (section 20(i)). 
Sri Lankan law takes an entirely different 
course. Although the proposed Bill 
postulates, as one of the main objectives of 
the Commission, “providing the people of 
Sri Lanka with a platform for truth telling” 
(section 12(d)), no provision whatever is made 
for conferment of amnesty in consequence of 
uninhibited disclosure. At the core of the law, 
there is a policy contradiction, with practical 
implications.
Conclusion 
The toll has been heavy on lives. It is elicited 
from those who were resident in the Province 
in 2011. However, many left prior, from the 
Province and their narratives are not captured 
in the enumeration. The numbers will be 
subject to debate. 
Legal closure and truth telling is what Prof. 
G.L Pieris has explained. 
Additionally in all our religions there is a 
spiritual dimension. I show an example from 
Beirut titled the Garden of Forgiveness and 
closer home, mentioning on what Hindus 
would undertake.<br />
F
ormally called Cardo Maximus, Hadiqat 
As-Samah, the Garden of Forgiveness, 
is an ancient ruin on which 15 civilizations 
have lived successively. The site, which is in 
downtown Beirut near Martyr’s Square, helps 
mark the green line where some of the most 
intense fighting during the civil war occurred. 
This line divided Beirut into east and west for 
more than a decade.
The vision Hadiqat As-Samah will be a 
garden in which people can gather strength 
and inspiration, a place for calm and 
gentle reflection. A garden for individual 
introspection, a sanctuary accessible to all. 
An edifying place, archetypal of Lebanon’s 
flora, with flowing water, suitably covered by 
sun and shade, which nurtures sentiments 
of peace, joy and healing. Beirut’s city center 
was always a meeting point for Lebanon’s 
many communities. It can therefore offer 
an important neutral location with a multi-
communal history that other parts of Beirut, 
or Lebanon as a whole, cannot. This area 
can also stand out as a paragon of social 
integration and reconstruction. As a global 
landmark, it will differentiate itself along 
spiritual lines rather than according to 
physical form or architectural grandeur.
As Beirut progresses with its rehabilitation 
and reconstruction, a sense of renewal 
and integration brings with it the need to 
come to terms with the past. Hadiqat As-
Samah is envisioned as a place of calm 
reflection, sheltered from the bustle of the 
city and expressing themes of understanding, 
forgiveness and unity. Open to all, Hadiqat 
As-Samah will be a pluralistic public space at 
the heart of the city. Integrating archeological 
remains of surviving city layers, Hadiqat As-
Samah will offer unique insights into earlier</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

86
civilizations. The integration of archeological 
artifacts within the garden will provide a 
historical context, demonstrating a shared 
ancestry that predates the recent conflict. 
By displaying these layers of civilizations, 
the garden will “use foundations of the past 
to build foundations for the future.” In its 
proximity to the wartime Green Line that 
divided the city and became the focus of 
conflict, Hadiqat As-Samah will challenge 
the segregation of communities. The garden, 
nestling between mosques and churches, 
will provide a meeting point for diverse 
communities and beliefs. Hadiqat As-Samah 
will be a place for individuals to reflect on their 
collective memory and perhaps to nurture a 
renewed sense of common identity.
Athma Shanthi Puja for Soul Peace and 
Liberation
What Is the Athma Shanthi Pooja? The Athma 
Shanthi Pooja is a sacred ritual performed to 
honor and bring peace to the souls of departed 
loved ones. According to Vedic traditions, 
this ceremony helps the departed soul find 
liberation (moksha) and can resolve any 
lingering karmic debts or disturbances. It is 
especially significant for those who passed 
away unexpectedly, tragically, or without the 
opportunity to receive proper rites.
Why Perform the Athma Shanthi Pooja?
The Athma Shanthi Pooja is a compassionate 
and powerful ritual that serves both the living 
and the departed. Here’s why it’s important: 
Soul Liberation: Help the departed soul attain 
peace and release from the cycle of rebirth; 
Karmic Resolution: Release negative karmic 
influences caused by unresolved ancestral 
energies; Ancestral Blessings: Bring blessings 
and protection from your ancestors into your 
life; Healing and Closure: Provide emotional 
healing and closure for grieving family 
members.
Who Should Consider This Pooja?
The Athma Shanthi Pooja is recommended for 
anyone who has lost a loved one and wishes 
to bring peace to their soul. It is especially 
beneficial if: The departed soul passed away 
under tragic or sudden circumstances.Proper 
funeral rites were not performed, or there is a 
feeling of unfinished spiritual business.You feel 
the presence of ancestral disturbances in your 
life. You want to honor and express gratitude 
to your ancestors.
How the Athma Shanti Pooja is 
Performed?
The ceremony is conducted according to 
ancient Vedic traditions and usually takes 
place near a sacred water body or an altar. 
Here’s what to expect: Invocation of Divine 
Energies: The ritual begins with the chanting 
of mantras and prayers to purify the space and 
invoke divine energies.
Sacred Offerings: Offerings, including rice, 
flowers, and sacred items, are made to the 
departed soul.
Prayers for Peace: Special prayers and mantras 
are chanted to bless the soul and guide it 
towards liberation.
Water Rituals: The ceremony may involve 
offerings to sacred waters, symbolizing the 
purification and release of the soul.
Given the significant bloodletting where 
thousands fell or have not been found, 
performing Athma Shanthis would be 
essential.</p>

Story
“Katheeja!”
“Hmm.”
She paused from chopping striped eel catfish 
and turned toward him under the pretext of 
sharpening her knife.
Even the other night, yearning for a life to take 
hold within her belly, she submitted her naked 
body and soul to him. The memory singed his 
heart like the sparks that flew from the knife as 
it made contact with the whetstone.
“Look here. This time, as soon 
as the rice paddy threshing at 
Madhurangundu is finished, let’s 
make a pilgrimage to Hayat Nabi’s 
holy mausoleum at Kataragama.”
The anguish in his words blended 
with their rhythm.
The thin saree that separated joy 
from suffering had a tear. Having seen 
his masculinity through that tear made her 
resolute. Sparks flew from her gaze.
“Why are you glowering?”
“No, after all those five-prayers-every-day and 
entire Friday nights at the mosque, it seems we 
are going to Kataragama now!”
Her words were punctuated by derisive 
laughter.
Translated from the original Tamil 
short story tapas (jf];) from his 
1992 collection of short stories 
by S.L.M. Hanifa.

Anger blinded Ahmed’s eyes.
“Bitch! How dare you! Where did you learn 
to talk like that?” Katheeja finished cutting 
the fish and stood up to wash her hands. Only 
when she was drying her hands using the top 
of her saree did she realize that her husband 
was waiting for a response.
“From you,” a derisive smile accompanied this 
feisty response to hit him with its full force.
His slap across her cheek jolted her, sharp and 
sudden, like an electric shock. Her eyes welled 
up.
Ahmad stared blankly into the silent void 
before him.
Clouds of morning mist hung motionless as 
though lost in meditation. His glance roamed 
across the sky and searched for the moon…
On the edge of the western horizon the 
reflection of the crescent moon was searching 
for its shine.
An ancient tamarind tree stood to the west of 
the farmer’s shed, enveloped by the humming 
of  its resident crow pheasants.
He was focused on the task of irrigating the 
bed of saplings.
He gathered up the thick semi-cylindrical 
barks hanging from the sapling guard pole and 
made his way towards the well.
The satisfaction of having irrigated twenty-
thousand saplings, before dawn crept up to 
swallow the retreating darkness, made him 
crave for a cup of tea.
Despite blowing on the wood-burning stove 
with all his might, he could not get the fire to 
catch. Smoke crept into his eyes, making them 
smart and igniting a fire of memory in his 
heart. The rope of memories, soaked with his 
emotions, stiffened, its frayed strands jutting 
out like rigid spikes.
Her image appeared in his heart, shimmering 
like a bouquet of flowers adorned with 
morning dew.
In the very next moment, his heart hardened 
and turned bitter.
Her eyelids batted furiously, her lips quavered, 
and her eyes turned red.
She always obediently acquiesced to him. 
But that day, the elegance of her newfound 
independence gave her a certain ferocity.
“Why don’t you abandon this infertile woman 
and find another?”
Her words were tinged with frustration. 
Ahmad barged into the house and yanked open 
the wooden cabinet with unusual force. Sarees 
and property deeds scattered in all directions.
“Here you go, all the riches your parents 
gave us. Goodbye.” He got onto a train right 
away. That was almost three months ago. 
He got a job with a Sinhala farmer in his 
chili plantation. The farmer grew fond of 
Ahmad’s hard work. Occasionally he would 
offer Ahmad a drink to show his appreciation. 
But Ahmad always stepped back. “Boss, it is 
enough that you give me the wages my work 
deserves.In my religion, it is a sin to even 
touch what is forbidden.” 
“Oh come on Ahmad,” the farmer would 
say, “all your Muslim bigwigs eat and drink 
everything nowadays! We are all the same, 
aren’t we?” as he gulped down his glass of 
coconut arrack.
Ahmad felt queasy. But his consistent refusal</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

only made his Boss respect him even more. 
Ahmad quickly became one of his trusted 
employees.
Ahmad’s thoughts dwell on how the trust he 
placed on the prospect of parenthood was 
shattered.
Katheeja’s captivating beauty filled his 
imagination. He could never take his eyes 
off her exquisitely sculpted breasts and her 
voluptuous body. She, in turn, would melt in 
his gaze and give herself unto him, as they 
would become one.
But fate had different ideas. Their marital bliss 
had a flaw. Her beautiful belly never enjoyed 
the pride of being pregnant. In their decade of 
wedded life,he spent every waking moment 
appealing to God. He sought a remedy for 
his impotence by devoting himself to the 
mausoleums of saints and their teachings.</p>

He made pledge after pledge. As a result, 
his herd of calves and his flock of chickens 
dwindled rapidly. Although he continued his 
efforts relentlessly, they bore no fruit.
But he did not lose faith in the power of 
pledges.
After sipping his tea slowly and taking tiny 
bites of a sweet between sips, he loosened the 
long underwear around his waist and waded 
into the river.
The river surged forward with force, roaring 
like a stampede of disoriented buffalos. The 
infant sun slowly rose in the east, its gentle 
rays eager to stretch across the emerald carpet 
of the land, growing stronger and harsher as 
the day unfolded.
He held his nose to dip into the cold water. 
When he raised his head again, his body 
could feel the memory of Katheeja. For 
three months, he was in the iron grip of 
those memories, his mind throbbed like the 
dismembered tail of a gecko caught in a trap.
He hastened to finish his bath and return to the 
farmer’s shed. With his right hand, he kneaded 
the old rice, softened overnight in water, with 
buffalo curd, shaping it into small balls that he 
popped into his mouth. They slipped down his 
throat as smoothly as river water.
“How is it going, thampi! Aren’t you going 
back home? The festival is tomorrow. I hear 
that Bulamir Sahibu is going to stage a play by 
the stream.” Ahmad raised his eyes from his 
plate when he heard Vilāvadi Yunus kākkā’s 
question. 
“For people like us, money in the pocket is 
what counts as a festival,” replied Ahmad 
and without waiting for a response, pushed a 
footstool towards Yunus kākkā.
He picked up another plate for Yunus kākkā, 
ladled some rice onto it, and heaped yogurt on 
top. The yogurt sat like a little white mountain 
atop the rice.
“You are right, Ahmad. Your wife came by 
the house yesterday. She must have come to 
inquire after you. But she didn’t broach the 
subject.”
“I couldn’t care less! Women who don’t obey 
their husbands deserve to be treated like that,” 
bristled Ahmad.
“What can the poor child do to cope with our 
anger?”
“Stop talking about her and talk about 
something else.”
“Ahmad, there is a little too much yogurt 
here,” continued Yunus kākkā. “My wife 
told me that your wife plucked all the tender 
mangoes from our tree. Apparently she hasn’t 
menstruated for three months.”
Yunus kākkā was oblivious to Ahmad. He kept 
on talking as he tilted his plate to drink the 
runny yogurt remaining on his plate.
Ahmad felt that the rice ball descending 
down his throat gave him a strange tingling 
sensation.
His thoughts flowed like a river. After a long 
time, his wife appeared in his mind, radiant 
with the glow of motherhood. She laughed 
joyfully. The sound seized him, gripping his 
thoughts. Tears welled up and splashed onto 
his body.
His boss, Dias, the Sinhala farmer, waddled 
towards him, breaking his reverie.
“How are you? Aren’t you going home for 
your festival? Here, take this fifty rupees—go 
home, and come back soon.”</p>

Ahmad stuffed the money into his pocket. 
He attached a sickle to the pole and headed 
towards the tamarind tree at the head of the 
plantation.
The tamarind fruits tinkled in the wind. He 
imagined the tinkle of the triumphant laughter 
of his wife joining in.
As he filled the palmyrah leaf basket with 
tamarind fruit, he made a mental note to look 
for wood-apples as well.
Determined to catch the ten o’clock train, his 
legs found the vigor and pride of a twenty-
year-old.</p>
