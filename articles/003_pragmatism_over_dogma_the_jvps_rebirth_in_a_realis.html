Pragmatism over Dogma: The 
JVP’s Rebirth in a Realist World
T
here’s a meme doing the rounds on Facebook about 
Modi’s recent visit:
During his visit to Sri Lanka, the Indian Prime Minister, 
seated in a car with his host, President Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake, looked around with mild confusion and said: 
“This is my fourth visit to Sri Lanka. Every time I came 
before, there were always crowds of angry people in black 
shirts, waving black flags and shouting anti-Indian slogans—
accusing us of expansionism and imperialism. But this time... 
not a single protester in sight. Have they changed their view 
of India? Or... did we just take a different route?”
To this, Anura Kumara grinned and replied: “We were those 
guys. Now we’re running the country. We know we can’t go 
around antagonising a regional superpower anymore.”
Sri Lanka witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime reception for a 
foreign leader during the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi. Beyond the optics, the two countries signed 
several key agreements—including a landmark defence 
cooperation pact that previous governments had either 
hesitated to pursue or outright avoided.
It’s almost amusing—and at the same time, commendable 
for its pragmatism—to see how far the JVP has come. Once 
a party that gained traction largely through its strong anti-
Indian rhetoric, it now leads a government under the NPP 
banner that is pragmatic enough to understand the real 
demands of governance.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP’s powerful decision-
making Politburo have clearly realized that you can’t govern 
a country like Zelensky’s Ukraine or Hamas’s Gaza—through 
constant confrontation, idealistic defiance, or by antagonizing

global superpowers. This world belongs to 
pragmatists, not to mythical warrior-kings 
who ride into battle driven by rigid belief 
systems, only to fall with arrows in their 
chests.
From Anti-India Firebrand to Pragmatic 
Partner: JVP’s Political Evolution
The JVP was born as a Marxist-Leninist 
revolutionary movement, the brainchild of 
Rohana Wijeweera—a Moscow-educated 
medical student who was more of a firebrand 
agitator than a pragmatic ideologue. Both he 
and the JVP were ideologically shaped by 
global leftist currents, drawing inspiration 
from figures like Mao Zedong, Vladimir 
Lenin, Che Guevara, and other revolutionary 
thinkers. In its early years, the JVP embraced 
class struggle, militant activism, and a 
staunch opposition to the prevailing political 
and economic order.
Its first uprising in 1971, though amateurish 
in organization, was a radical experiment led 
by idealistic and inexperienced youth. Despite 
its limited military success, the rebellion 
shook the nation—primarily because of the 
state's brutal crackdown, which resulted in the 
deaths of thousands.
By the late 1980s, as New Delhi deepened its 
involvement in Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict—
particularly through its support to Tamil 
militant groups and the eventual signing of 
the Indo-Lanka Accord—the JVP re-emerged 
with renewed vigor and a new target for its 
revolutionary ire: India.
With the signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord in 
1987, Rohana Wijeweera and his comrades 
no longer viewed India as a benign neighbor 
but as a neo-imperialist power intent on 
undermining Sri Lankan sovereignty.
JVP propaganda during this period portrayed 
India as a regional bully—an "expansionist" 
force not unlike Western imperialists. The 
party’s literature, public speeches, and posters 
accused India of plotting to turn Sri Lanka 
into a client state. This anti-Indian narrative 
became deeply institutionalized within the 
movement.
Oaths reportedly taken by JVP recruits at 
the time allegedly included a vow to “resist 
all forms of foreign intervention, especially 
Indian expansionism.” One of the JVP’s 
foundational ‘Five Lectures,’ delivered by 
Wijeweera himself, was dedicated entirely to 
the threat of Indian imperialism, emphasizing 
the belief that India aimed to undermine Sri 
Lanka’s sovereignty.
Wijeweera, known for his fiery speeches, 
once declared: “India is not helping Sri 
Lanka out of goodwill. Its long-term plan is 
to divide and dominate us.” This anti-India 
sentiment wasn’t just part of the party’s 
internal discourse—it shaped its propaganda, 
recruitment, and actions during the height of 
its second insurrection.
Fiery Rebellion and Anti-Indian Rhetoric 
in the 1980s
The Indo-Lanka Peace Accord of 1987—an 
agreement that brought the Indian Peace 
Keeping Force (IPKF) into Sri Lanka and 
introduced devolution through the 13th 
Amendment—was, to the JVP, nothing short 
of an Indian invasion cloaked in diplomacy. 
The party erupted in fury, launching street 
agitations, incendiary propaganda, and a 
campaign of targeted violence to resist what 
it perceived as a betrayal by Colombo and the 
imposition of a “Delhi diktat.”
Rohana Wijeweera publicly denounced the</p>

presence of Indian troops, declaring them an 
“occupying army” sent not to preserve peace 
but to “subdue the will of the Sri Lankan 
people.” He warned that unless Sri Lankans 
resisted, the island risked becoming “another 
province of India”—a satellite state with its 
sovereignty quietly extinguished.
Such rhetoric resonated deeply with segments 
of the Sinhala nationalist base, who were 
already wary of India’s intentions. The 
JVP skillfully tapped into this resentment, 
converting popular frustration into a militant 
uprising. Between 1987 and 1989, the party 
launched a full-blown insurrection, marked 
by assassinations, sabotage, and open 
confrontation with the state—a conflict that 
resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of 
Sri Lankans on both sides.
In justifying the turn to armed rebellion, 
Wijeweera framed it as a last resort. “When 
the state surrenders the nation to foreign 
powers,” he argued, “it becomes not only our 
right but our duty to take up arms in defense 
of the motherland.”
The JVP began targeting individuals they 
accused of collaborating with India—
branding them as traitors. In response, the 
Sri Lankan government unleashed a brutal 
counter-insurgency campaign, targeting not 
only active JVP members but also suspected 
sympathizers and even those who merely 
expressed mild dissent.
Scores of people—mostly young men and 
women—were killed by both sides in an orgy 
of violence. This tragic scenario is perhaps 
best captured by the words of the legendary 
writer Khushwant Singh in his novel Train 
to Pakistan: “In truth, both sides killed. Both 
shot and stabbed and speared and clubbed. 
Both tortured. Both raped.” His words, 
though written about another time and place, 
hauntingly echo the Sri Lankan experience 
during the JVP insurrection.
The same JVP-led government that now 
champions the rule of law and justice has 
arrested former Eastern Province Chief 
Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan—
better known as Pillayan—in connection 
with the 2006 abduction and suspected 
murder of Professor S. Raveendranath, then 
Vice Chancellor of Eastern University. The 
case, still unresolved after 18 years, remains 
one of the darkest chapters in Sri Lanka’s 
academic history. If Pillayan is guilty, justice 
must be served—without hesitation, without 
compromise.
But here’s the bitter irony: Pillayan stands 
accused of a murder 18 years ago. Yet the JVP 
itself committed murders 18 years before that. 
In the blood-soaked late 1980s, it was the JVP 
that gunned down scholars, vice chancellors, 
and teachers. It was the JVP that pioneered 
the systematic targeting of intellectuals, 
branding those who refused to bow to their 
radical ideology as “traitors,” and executing 
them with cold precision.
Among their first victims was Professor 
Stanley Wijesundera, the revered first Vice 
Chancellor of the University of Colombo. A 
visionary scholar and a symbol of academic 
independence, he was shot dead inside the 
Library Room at College House in 1989—his 
only 'crime' was defying the JVP’s demand to 
shut down the university.
Soon after, Professor Chandratne 
Patuwathavithane, Vice Chancellor of the 
University of Moratuwa, was gunned down 
in his office in September 1989 for refusing 
to yield to JVP threats. The blood didn’t stop 
there. The JVP’s guns turned toward anyone 
who stood in their way:</p>

Dr. Gladys Jayawardene, Chairperson of the 
State Pharmaceuticals Corporation—was 
gunned down in 1989.
Ven. Kotikawatte Saddhatissa Thera, a 
respected Buddhist monk and voice of 
moderation.
Thevis Guruge, Chairman of the Sri Lanka 
Broadcasting Corporation—was silenced 
forever.
Premakeerthi de Alwis, the beloved lyricist 
and broadcaster—was slaughtered simply for 
being a public figure who didn’t sing their 
tune.
Hundreds of teachers, doctors, monks, public 
servants, and media personnel were murdered 
during the 1987–1989 JVP insurrection. 
Their only fault was choosing reason over 
revolution, moderation over madness, and Sri 
Lanka over a blood-soaked dream.
And the JVP had the audacity to justify these 
killings. They called their victims “traitors.” 
But history remembers them as patriots.
The government, too, responded with 
barbaric force. In its effort to crush the JVP 
insurrection, it deployed every brutal tactic 
from the counterinsurgency playbook—mass 
arrests, extrajudicial killings, torture, and 
disappearances became commonplace.
By the time the insurrection was finally 
quelled in late 1989, estimates suggest that 
between 40,000 and 60,000 people—mostly 
young Sinhalese men and women—had lost 
their lives. The JVP’s top leadership was 
decimated, and its militant machinery was 
dismantled.
Its anti-Indian crusade exacted a horrific 
toll—not only in lives but also on the national 
psyche—leaving behind a complex legacy of 
trauma and deep-rooted mistrust toward India.
JVP’s Rebirth as the NPP
Over the next two decades, the JVP 
gradually shed much of its militant baggage. 
It contested elections, entered parliament, 
and even joined coalition governments 
briefly. Under Somawansa Amarasinghe and 
later Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the JVP 
moderated its ideology, moving away from 
insurrectionary Marxism toward a platform 
of anti-corruption, social justice, and good 
governance.
In this transformation, the JVP’s strident 
anti-India line also began to soften. The new 
generation of leaders recognized that to be 
a credible national force – one aiming to 
govern, not just protest – they could ill afford 
the ideological rigidity of the past.
When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
visited Sri Lanka, NPP politicians displayed 
none of the hostility their party elders once 
harbored. Anura Kumara Dissanayake himself 
spoke of the “mutual respect” between Sri 
Lanka and India—a far cry from Rohana 
Wijeweera’s caustic denunciations decades 
ago. Notably, the JVP’s 1980s-era rhetoric 
portraying India as an imperialist oppressor is 
absent from the NPP’s current discourse.
Pragmatism Over Dogma: A Calculated 
Shift
What explains this stunning about-face in the 
JVP’s stance toward India? At first glance, it 
might appear hypocritical—how does a party 
go from oath-bound anti-Indian militancy 
to signing defence agreements with the very 
same nation? But a closer, more analytical 
look suggests something else.
The ideological rigidity that once helped 
the JVP rally rebellions is ill-suited for the</p>

complex, pragmatic demands of governing 
a modern nation-state. To its credit, the JVP 
seems to have recognized this hard truth.
Engaging constructively with India is not 
merely diplomatic courtesy—it is a strategic 
necessity. Geography and economics both 
demand it. India is not only Sri Lanka’s 
closest neighbor but also a regional 
superpower and a vital economic partner. 
When Sri Lanka teetered on the brink of 
financial collapse in 2022, it was India that 
stepped in first—with over $4 billion in 
emergency aid, credit lines, and essential 
supplies.
Any political force serious about steering Sri 
Lanka out of the crisis must maintain stable, 
respectful ties with New Delhi—especially in 
the wake of new U.S. tariff hikes, including 
a proposed 44% tariff on certain goods. The 
United States currently absorbs around 25% 
of Sri Lanka’s exports, making diversification 
and regional trade relations even more 
critical.
The NPP leadership seems to understand 
this reality. In shedding its reflexive anti-
India posture, the JVP/NPP has significantly 
boosted its credibility as a responsible, 
mainstream political actor—one that places 
national interest above ideological rigidity.
This recalibration sends a clear signal to 
voters—and to international partners—that 
an NPP-led government would not jeopardize 
Sri Lanka’s foreign relations for the sake of 
outdated revolutionary rhetoric. Instead, it 
aspires to govern with realism, responsibility, 
and reform.
In a country long trapped between populism 
and paralysis, this shift is not just welcome—
it is essential. And at Jaffna Monitor, we are 
glad to acknowledge it.

7.7 Magnitude, Zero Mercy: 
Jaffna Monitor in Mandalay, 
Myanmar
Myanmar’s 
Quake Meets 
a Merciless 
Regime
A
t midday on March 28, 2025, 
a powerful 7.7-magnitude 
earthquake struck central Myanmar, 
with its epicenter near Mandalay—a 
city where Tamils form a notable 
part of the population.
It was one of the most devastating 
quakes to hit the country in a 
century. The destruction was 
swift, merciless, and deeply tragic.</p>

The military regime, already notorious for 
its secrecy and lack of transparency, began 
downplaying the true scale of the disaster. In a 
move to control the narrative, the junta swiftly 
suspended journalist visas, effectively shutting 
out the international media and limiting 
independent reporting on the ground.
But Jaffna Monitor chose not to look away. 
Determined to witness the catastrophe 
firsthand, we set out for earthquake-hit 
Mandalay. We reached out to our contacts in 
Myanmar—including two “Rakhi sisters” of 
one of our senior correspondents, who lives in 
Sri Lanka.
For readers unfamiliar with the term, the 
Rakhi sisters are not related by blood. The 
bond was formed years ago during a Raksha 
Bandhan celebration, when the two young 
women, residents of Mandalay, tied a symbolic 
rakhi (a sacred thread) on his wrist—a gesture 
signifying a lifelong sibling relationship. That 
bond of affection and solidarity has endured 
ever since.
But this was no ordinary reporting trip. 
With commercial flights suspended and the 
military junta increasingly suspicious of 
anyone entering the country after the quake, 
we couldn't take the usual routes. Instead, 
we flew into Yangon and then undertook a 
long, discreet overland journey. For security 
reasons, we won’t disclose exactly how 
we reached Mandalay—but we got there. 
Somehow, within days of the disaster.
One of our team members, a devoted Buddhist 
with strong connections to the monasteries 
and monks in Mandalay, arranged for us to 
stay at a Buddhist monastery located in the 
heart of the city.
And what we saw… was beyond words.
Mandalay After the Quake
When we reached Mandalay—Myanmar’s 
second-largest city, once a vibrant hub 
adorned with majestic Buddhist and Hindu 
shrines, and strategically located along vital 
trade routes—it felt like stepping into the 
aftermath of an apocalypse. Once a flourishing 
cultural and commercial center that prompted</p>

both regional powers, India and China, to 
establish consulates, Mandalay now lay in 
ruins.
When Jaffna Monitor arrived, the city 
resembled a vast open-air refugee camp. 
Nearly everyone was outside. Many of 
Mandalay’s 1.5 million residents were sleeping 
on the streets, in parks, and on temple 
grounds—either because their homes had 
collapsed or out of fear that aftershocks would 
bring down the already-weakened structures. 
Wild rumors swept through the city—
whispers of an even more powerful quake on 
the way. Even those whose homes remained 
intact refused to go inside.
According to local sources, more than 5,000 
people were killed—nearly double the death 
toll acknowledged by the military junta. 
Médecins Sans Frontières reported that over 
500 buildings had collapsed entirely, with 
another 800 partially destroyed. Critical 
infrastructure was severely damaged: major 
bridges buckled, roads cracked open, and the 
city’s airport sustained structural damage. 
Power outages plunged Mandalay into 
darkness, while water and communication 
networks failed completely.
With little to no access to heavy machinery, 
rescue efforts remained heartbreakingly 
rudimentary. Locals and volunteers dug 
through the debris using their bare hands and 
makeshift tools, desperate to find survivors. As 
of now, only 15 people have been pulled out 
alive. The rest… never made it.
“There’s too much rubble, and no proper 
rescue teams have come for us,” sobbed a 
woman digging through the debris in search of 
her missing relatives.
In the stifling April heat—when temperatures 
soared to 39–41°C—survivors and first 
responders labored under unbearable 
conditions. Occasional nighttime rains 
brought no relief—only added misery. Yet no 
one dared return indoors. “We would rather 
be drenched and bitten by mosquitoes than</p>

buried under bricks,” said Muthu, an elderly 
Tamil man, huddled beneath a tarpaulin sheet.
The relatively well-off slept outdoors under 
mosquito nets, while the poor lay on bare 
ground with only a thin cloth—or nothing at 
all. But fear erased social divides. Ironically, 
everyone—from the affluent to the destitute—
was united by the catastrophe.
Anytime, an Epidemic’: Quake-Hit 
Mandalay Faces New Threat
A local relief worker told Jaffna Monitor that 
delivering aid to everyone in need was “a near-
impossible task.” The scale of the devastation 
was overwhelming. “There aren’t enough tents, 
not enough food or clean water. Women and 
children are especially vulnerable,” he said, 
visibly exhausted. Many families lacked basic 
hygiene kits, sanitary products, and baby 
formula.
With sanitation systems completely broken 
down, open defecation was becoming 
increasingly common, and access to clean 
water was dangerously limited. “If this 
continues,” warned another aid worker, “we 
could be facing a deadly outbreak of cholera or 
other waterborne diseases.” He added grimly, 
“An epidemic could strike Mandalay any day 
now.”

a major natural disaster: the presence of 
international journalists. Typically, media 
teams from around the world would converge 
to document the devastation and amplify 
the voices of survivors. But in Myanmar, 
the military junta effectively banned foreign 
journalists from entering the country and 
intimidated local reporters into silence.
To justify the ban on international media, 
the junta issued what can only be described 
as a cruel excuse. In an official statement, 
the military claimed that, since “there is no 
proper accommodation or food facilities in 
the affected areas,” journalists would not be 
permitted entry—as if foreign correspondents 
were arriving for a luxury retreat amidst the 
ruins.
But the real reason behind the ban is not 
logistical—it is political. Jaffna Monitor has 
learned that the junta’s true fear is scrutiny, 
not shortage. A Yangon-based journalist,

speaking on condition of anonymity due to 
obvious safety concerns, told us: “The junta 
is afraid that if foreign journalists are allowed 
in, they will head straight to the conflict zones 
and expose the brutal human rights violations 
being committed by the military.”
Myanmar’s Military Drops Bombs 
Instead of Aid
Since the February 2021 military coup—in 
which the junta seized power from Myanmar’s 
elected government—the country has been 
plunged into a nationwide civil conflict. 
Fierce resistance has emerged across multiple 
regions, most notably in Sagaing, Chin, 
Kayah, and the Karen States. The junta’s 
counterinsurgency campaign has been marked 
by aerial bombings, extrajudicial killings, 
the burning of entire villages, and deliberate 
attacks on civilian infrastructure, including 
schools and hospitals.
The military’s brutality has not paused—even 
in the face of a humanitarian disaster. A 
Myanmar journalist based in Mandalay told 
Jaffna Monitor that in Sagaing—one of the 
regions hardest hit by the earthquake—the 
junta bombed an area where civilians were 
actively rescuing people trapped beneath 
collapsed buildings. “People were digging 
through the rubble to save others when the 
bombs fell,” the journalist said. “It was chaos. 
The junta didn’t care if they were hitting 
survivors or volunteers.”
Multiple reports by the United Nations and 
international human rights organizations have 
accused the Tatmadaw—the official name 
of Myanmar’s military—of committing war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. The 
regime has aggressively sought to suppress 
this reality by tightly controlling the flow 
of information, arresting more than 150 
journalists since the coup, and forcing nearly 
all independent media outlets to shut down, 
flee the country, or operate in hiding.
Myanmar has a long and troubling history 
of blocking journalists and humanitarian 
workers—even in the wake of catastrophic</p>

natural disasters. In 2008, when Cyclone 
Nargis devastated the Irrawaddy Delta and 
killed an estimated 138,000 people, the 
military regime shocked the world by denying 
international aid agencies access during the 
critical early weeks of the crisis. Thousands of 
lives were lost due to delayed assistance.
The pattern repeated in 2023, after Cyclone 
Mocha—a powerful storm that battered 
Rakhine State and other western regions. 
Despite widespread destruction and 
displacement, the junta once again barred 
international humanitarian workers from 
reaching affected areas. Even the United 
Nations issued a rare public condemnation, 
urging the regime to permit lifesaving relief 
operations.
“This time, however, is a little different,” a local 
civil society leader told Jaffna Monitor. In the 
aftermath of the March 2025 earthquake, the 
junta—for the first time in recent memory—
issued an open call for international assistance. 
“They had no choice,” he explained. “The 
destruction was too massive, and they simply 
lacked the capacity to respond on their own.”
As a result, emergency responders from the 
United Nations and several international 
NGOs were granted limited access—but only 
to areas firmly under military control. Rebel-
held regions such as parts of Sagaing, Chin, 
and Kayah remained off-limits.
In Mandalay itself, some neighborhoods had 
slipped from the junta’s grasp and were under 
the control of anti-junta resistance forces. 
Just across the Irrawaddy River, Sagaing had 
become one of the most intense battlegrounds 
in the ongoing civil conflict. While we were 
still in Mandalay, we heard the unmistakable 
sound of an airstrike—this time targeting 
civilian areas in earthquake-ravaged Sagaing. 
According to local sources, the junta had 
launched the attack as part of its continued 
military campaign against the People’s Defence 
Forces (PDF), a decentralized resistance</p>

movement formed in response to the 2021 
coup.
To make matters worse, the junta blocked all 
humanitarian aid to rebel-held areas, halting 
relief efforts completely. Entire villages—
already reduced to rubble by the earthquake—
were denied even basic emergency support 
such as food, water, and medical supplies.
Most of the People’s Defence Forces—
composed largely of young, inexperienced 
fighters—operate under the command of 
the National Unity Government (NUG), a 
parallel government-in-exile formed by ousted 
lawmakers, ethnic minority leaders, and civil 
society representatives. While the junta brands 
the NUG and the PDFs as “terrorists,” many 
Burmese view them as the legitimate voice of 
resistance and hope.
Shaken but Not Broken: Myanmar’s 
Centuries-Old Tamil Community 
Endures in the Quake Zone
The Tamil community of Myanmar has a long, 
storied history—and a delicate present. Tamils, 
most of whom trace their ancestry to southern 
India, began migrating to Burma in the 19th 
century when both regions were under British 
colonial rule.
Under British administration, many Indians—
including Tamils—moved into Upper Burma 
as civil servants, traders, soldiers, and laborers. 
Over time, Tamils became an integral part 
of the country’s social and economic life, 
especially in cities like Yangon (formerly 
Rangoon) and Mandalay.
Today, Tamils form the largest subgroup 
within Myanmar’s Indian-origin population, 
which makes up roughly 4–5% of the national 
demographic. Tamil is the most widely 
spoken Indian language in the country. Many 
Tamil families are now in their fourth or fifth 
generation in Myanmar and have preserved 
key aspects of their heritage—from Hindu 
temples and Tamil schools to traditional 
festivals—while integrating into broader 
Burmese society.
Mandalay remains one of the central hubs of 
this community. Tamil traders and craftsmen 
have for decades run businesses ranging from 
textiles and spices to jewelry and tea shops.

Tamil families have built a vibrant, close-
knit community. The area is also home to 
two prominent Tamil temples: the Siddhi 
Vinayaka Temple (popularly known as the 
Ganesh Temple) and the Sri Muneeswaran 
Temple. Remarkably, both emerged 
unscathed from the recent earthquake—a 
fact many locals regard as nothing short of 
divine intervention.
But the surrounding Tamil quarters were 
not so fortunate. Dozens of homes and 
shops were flattened. Once-busy tea stalls, 
saree shops, and temple courtyards now lie 
buried beneath rubble.
Tamil Christian communities in nearby 
areas have also suffered deeply. In Chin 
Nyaung Pin Thar, a village outside 
Mandalay, the Calvary Prayer Hill and 
surrounding Christian settlements 
sustained extensive damage during the 
quake, leaving many injured and displaced.
“As with their Burmese neighbors, Tamil 
families have been left homeless and 
are struggling to secure even the most 
basic necessities—clean water, food, and 
medicine,” said a retired schoolteacher 
and community elder. His own home 
in Mandalay’s 26th Street Tamil quarter 
was destroyed. “My daughter and 
grandchildren are sleeping under a tree in 
the temple compound. We haven’t received 
any formal aid. Everything we’re eating 
now comes from what the community 
cooks together in large pots,” he told Jaffna 
Monitor.
A Yangon-based Tamil aid coordinator 
confirmed the lack of organized relief in 
several neighborhoods across Mandalay. 
“Many areas have yet to be reached by aid 
agencies,” she said. “The Tamil enclaves in 
Mandalay are among them. Most residents</p>

are relying entirely on grassroots, community-
driven solidarity.”
Still, amid the devastation, resilience prevails. 
Community members—regardless of 
ethnicity—have come together to share what 
little they have. Volunteers like 19-year-old 
Arulmurugan from the Tamil Youth Forum 
have been delivering food packets and boiled 
water from makeshift kitchens. “We don’t ask 
if someone is Tamil or Bamar,” he said. “We 
just ask, ‘Have you eaten?’”
Aid Stalled. Fear Spreads
For a brief period following the earthquake, 
Myanmar’s military junta eased roadblocks 
and allowed limited humanitarian access. But 
during Jaffna Monitor’s time in Mandalay, we 
witnessed a reversal: roadblocks and military 
checkpoints were swiftly re-established, 
restricting the movement of both local and 
international relief workers.
While foreign rescue teams from neighboring 
countries were technically permitted entry, 
their operations remained tightly controlled. 
Teams from India, China, Thailand, Singapore, 
Laos, Malaysia, and Russia were escorted by 
the military and confined to designated zones 
within Mandalay.
Among the international presence, Russian 
rescue workers stood out. According to 
a local anti-junta activist who spoke to 
Jaffna Monitor, “Russia is the junta’s main 
facilitator—offering moral, financial, and 
even military support.” Two Russian aircraft 
landed in Mandalay, carrying more than 300 
rescue workers. Yet despite their numbers, one 
Russian relief worker privately admitted they 
had rescued only a single person alive from the 
debris.
A group of Sri Lankans working in Yangon 
pooled their own resources to deliver aid. “We 
couldn’t just sit and watch,” said one volunteer. 
“Even though we’re far from home, we know 
what it means to suffer. We just wanted to 
help.” The group traveled to Mandalay and 
directly distributed food, water, and essential 
supplies to affected families.

Echoes of Mullivaikkal
Though the military junta has banned relief 
work in rebel-held areas—and continues 
relentless shelling even as civilians remain 
trapped under debris—Jaffna Monitor 
has learned that some courageous local 
organizations are still carrying out 
humanitarian operations in these zones, albeit 
clandestinely.
“We call them low-profile operations,” said 
one aid worker who managed to enter the 
rebel-controlled territories. Speaking under 
strict anonymity, he described the situation as 
“unexplainable, almost medieval.” Hospitals 
have been destroyed or abandoned, and even 
the most basic medical supplies—antibiotics, 
painkillers, bandages—are nearly impossible 
to find. “No outsiders are allowed in, and the 
military doesn’t want the world to know what’s 
happening here,” he added.
The current crisis bears an unsettling 
resemblance to a dark chapter in recent 
history—the final months of Sri Lanka’s civil 
war in 2009—when tens of thousands of Tamil 
civilians were trapped between an unrelenting 
military offensive and the rigid extremism 
of the LTTE, with no access to humanitarian 
assistance or safe passage. “What we are 
witnessing now is disturbingly similar,” a 
Tamil aid worker told Jaffna Monitor. “As in 
Sri Lanka, it is the ordinary civilians—not 
the decision-makers—who are caught in the 
crossfire.”
Another relief worker echoed the tragedy: 
“Most of these people were already victims of 
war—displaced, impoverished, traumatized. 
Now the earthquake has shattered what little 
they had left.”
Where Does the Aid Go? Junta’s Grip 
Casts Doubt on Relief Efforts
Given the deeply corrupt nature of Myanmar’s 
military junta, relief workers who spoke with 
Jaffna Monitor expressed serious skepticism 
about how much of the international aid will 
actually reach those most in need.
Members of several relief agencies now 
argue that humanitarian assistance must 
be channeled through independent local 
networks—such as monasteries, community 
groups, and civil society organizations—rather 
than routed through the junta. Only then, they 
insist, can essential supplies genuinely reach 
affected communities.
An aid worker recalled how, in the past, 
multiple governments had sent direct 
assistance to the military regime following 
natural disasters—only to later find that much 
of the aid never reached the public. “Some of 
it ended up in the homes of military leaders,” 
he said, “and the rest was being sold openly 
in local markets.” Having witnessed this 
firsthand, he questioned the logic of repeating 
the same mistake. “Now again, some countries 
are sending aid directly to the junta, bypassing 
proper humanitarian channels. How can they 
be sure it won’t be exploited just like before?”
“Apart from the United States, many countries 
have offered help,” another aid worker 
told Jaffna Monitor. “But the real question 
is—how much of it actually reaches the 
people?” With corruption in the junta being 
well-documented, and in the absence of 
transparency or independent oversight, there 
is growing fear that a significant portion of 
the aid is being diverted, politicized, or simply 
disappearing without a trace.</p>

ndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 
during his whirlwind visit to Sri Lanka, held 
a 45-minute meeting with a Tamil political 
delegation representing the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces. The group was made up of 
representatives from the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Katchi (ITAK), the Democratic Tamil National 
Alliance (DTNA), and the Tamil National 
People’s Front (TNPF).
Interestingly, the delegation was formed based 
on a 4:2:1 ratio proposed by the Indian side—
four from ITAK, two from DTNA, and one 
from TNPF.
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was 
represented by Acting President C.V.K. 
Sivagnanam, General Secretary M.A. 
Sumanthiran, and Members of Parliament S. 
Shritharan and Shanakiyan Rasamanickam. 
From the DTNA, MPs Selvam Adaikalanathan 
and Dharmalingam Siddharthan took part, 
while the TNPF was represented by its leader, 
MP Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam.

During the meeting with the Tamil political 
delegation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi paid heartfelt tributes to the late Tamil 
political leaders R. Sampanthan and Mavai 
S. Senathirajah, describing them as stalwarts 
of Tamil politics in Sri Lanka and personal 
associates.
“I wish to express my condolences on the 
passing of respected Tamil leaders Mr. R. 
Sampanthan and Mr. Mavai Senathirajah. They 
were personally known to me, and their loss 
marks the end of an era,” PM Modi told the 
delegation.
“I remember how, during their time, Tamil 
parties stood united under one umbrella.”
Not stopping there, Modi took to X (formerly 
known as Twitter) shortly after the meeting, 
posting: “It is always a pleasure to meet 
with the leaders of the Tamil community 
in Sri Lanka. During this meeting, I 
conveyed my condolences on the passing of 
respected leaders R. Sampanthan and Mavai 
Senathirajah, both of whom I personally knew. 
I reaffirmed India’s unwavering commitment 
to ensuring equality, dignity, and justice for the 
Tamil community within a united Sri Lanka. 
Several projects and initiatives launched 
during my visit will continue to contribute 
to the social, economic, and cultural 
advancement of the Tamil people.”
The Art of War: Sumanthiran vs. 
Sritharan
Here’s the funny bit that didn’t make the 
official press releases: the lead-up to Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with the 
Tamil political delegation had its own mini 
power struggle—starring none other than the 
two rivals locked in the ongoing leadership 
tussle within the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi 
(ITAK): M.A. Sumanthiran and S. Shritharan.
Sources say that both were working overtime 
behind the scenes to make sure the other 
didn’t get a chance to meet Modi. In a rather 
crafty move, Sumanthiran allegedly suggested 
that only the party’s President and General 
Secretary should attend the meeting, which 
conveniently meant himself and his loyalist, 
Acting President C.V.K. Sivagnanam—leaving 
others out.

But not to be outmaneuvered, Shritharan 
countered with a suggestion of his own: only 
sitting MPs from ITAK should be invited—
handily excluding Sumanthiran, who failed to 
win a seat in the last parliamentary elections.
Caught in the middle of this political ping-
pong, the Indian side—clearly no strangers to 
Lankan Tamil petty politics—saw through the 
behind-the-scenes drama. They proposed that 
the ITAK delegation include the President, the 
General Secretary, and two MPs, ensuring that 
no one could claim victory in this unfolding 
Tamil telenovela. Accordingly, ITAK President 
C.V.K. Sivagnanam, General Secretary M.A. 
Sumanthiran, and sitting MPs Shanakiyan 
Rasamanickam and S. Shritharan made the 
cut.
Modi’s Age Check Leaves ITAK 
President Blushing, Others Chuckling
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, known for 
his diligence in background checks before 
meeting any delegation, reportedly asked 
ITAK President C.V.K. Sivagnanam with a 
smile, “Are you over 90?” Sivagnanam replied 
with a chuckle, “No, no… I’m just 85.” Modi 
then remarked, “You’re probably the oldest 
Tamil politician in Sri Lanka,” according to a 
source who attended the meeting.
While the exchange appeared to be a 
lighthearted moment, a source within the 
ITAK later joked to Jaffna Monitor that Modi 
ji was perhaps subtly asking why Sivagnanam, 
at his age, wasn't enjoying retirement with his 
great-grandchildren—instead of acting as a 
puppet president for ITAK and playing the 
loyal footman to M.A. Sumanthiran.
ITAK’s Electoral Maths: 5 &gt; 1
Of the four members representing ITAK in 
the delegation, three hailed from the North—
specifically Jaffna—while only one, Shanakiyan 
Rasamanickam, represented the East 
(Batticaloa). The other three Tamil delegates—
two from the DTNA and one from the 
TNPF—were also from the Northern Province.
This regional imbalance sparked sharp 
criticism on social media and among political 
observers, who questioned, “Are Eastern Tamil 
leaders not considered leaders too?” ITAK, 
in particular, came under fire, with many 
pointing out that in the last parliamentary 
election, the party secured just one seat in 
Jaffna, while it won five seats in the East.
Critics argue that this representation does 
not reflect the party’s current electoral base, 
and accuse ITAK’s leadership of continuing 
a Jaffna-centric approach at the expense of 
genuine inclusivity and balanced regional 
representation.
Lights, Camera, Boycott!
According to credible sources, ITAK (read: 
M.A. Sumanthiran and his loyal circle) had 
internally decided that Sumanthiran would 
speak on behalf of the Tamil delegation during 
the meeting with Prime Minister Modi. It was 
all neatly arranged—with a rehearsal, no less. 
A few hours before the official interaction, the 
four-member team even held a mock round, 
presumably to get the script just right.
But the drama didn’t end there. Sumanthiran’s 
arch-rival, MP S. Sritharan, reportedly skipped 
the rehearsal altogether—either as a silent 
protest or perhaps to avoid being typecast 
as a side character in what he saw as “The 
Sumanthiran Show.”
And if that wasn’t dramatic enough, Sritharan 
doubled down by boycotting the official</p>

ITAK press conference held after the meeting 
with Modi. As one insider quipped to Jaffna 
Monitor, “It was less of a press conference and 
more of a one-man monologue.”
India Reaffirms Support for Tamil 
Rights, Provincial Polls on the Horizon
Sources who attended the meeting told Jaffna 
Monitor that the closed-door discussion 
took place at the Taj Samudra Hotel and 
lasted approximately 45 minutes. During the 
dialogue, Prime Minister Modi conveyed that 
the Sri Lankan government, under President 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, had given a 
clear commitment to hold the long-delayed 
Provincial Council elections—but only after 
the conclusion of local government polls and 
the implementation of necessary legal reforms.
According to those present, Modi assured 
the Tamil delegation that India would 
“do everything possible” to support this 
democratic process, and emphasized that New 
Delhi remains committed to Tamil political 
empowerment within a united Sri Lanka. He 
reportedly told the delegation, “India is like 
your second home. You are welcome in Delhi 
at any time to engage in dialogue and share 
your concerns.”
The discussion also addressed the pressing 
issue of fishermen's rights, a longstanding 
source of friction between communities across 
the Palk Strait. Modi is said to have stressed 
the need for a humane and cooperative 
resolution, while voicing support for ending 
illegal bottom trawling practices—which have 
contributed to environmental degradation 
and increased tensions between Indian and Sri 
Lankan fishing communities.

concerns, ranging from power devolution and 
development to environmental and livelihood 
issues.

elections but made it clear that “the 13th 
Amendment, even if fully implemented, is not 
enough” to deliver meaningful power-sharing. 
He highlighted the ongoing land appropriation 
in Tamil-majority areas. He also urged India to 
invest in long-term development in the North 
and East—particularly in housing, education, 
and infrastructure.
Dharmalingam Siddharthan expressed 
gratitude for Indian-backed projects like 
the Jaffna Cultural Centre, and stressed the 
urgent need for job-creating investments in 
the region. “We asked for Indian support 
to resolve the fisheries conflict and create 
employment for youth,” he said, adding that 
Prime Minister Modi responded positively and 
showed a willingness to engage further.
TNPF Leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam 
struck a firmer tone, describing the 13th 
Amendment as a “distorted outcome” of the 
Indo-Lanka Accord. He said he had told PM 
Modi that genuine power-sharing cannot 
occur within a unitary state, and that India 
must help move the Tamil question beyond 
that framework and urged him to invite Tamil 
political parties to Delhi for meaningful 
discussions on establishing a shared 
governance model under the Indo-Lanka 
Accord.
Gajendrakumar also expressed full support 
for India-led development in the North and 
East, but with a firm caveat: it must not alter 
the demographic composition of the region—a 
pointed reference to Sinhala settlements that 
quietly may have crept in under the banner of 
"development." But as one observer cheekily 
noted, for a man so vehemently opposed to 
Sinhala workers settling in Tamil areas, he 
didn’t quite explain how he himself came 
to own acres of prime land in the heart of 
Colombo and other Sinhala-majority zones. 
“One even wondered aloud,” the observer 
added, “whether he plans to donate that land 
to landless Sinhala families—just to keep 
things ideologically consistent.”
Gajendrakumar also stressed that 
developments must not open the door to 
foreign powers hostile to India’s interests—a 
not-so-subtle nod to China, which, 
unsurprisingly, likely earned him an approving 
smile or two from the Indian side.
