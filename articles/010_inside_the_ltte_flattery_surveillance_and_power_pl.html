Inside the LTTE: Flattery, 
Surveillance, and Power Play
Contrary to the popular 
belief that Prabhakaran 
was indifferent to praise or 
criticism, credible sources 
disclosed to the Jaffna 
Monitor that he valued 
and often encouraged 
commendation. These 
sources noted that key 
figures in Prabhakaran's 
inner circle, including 
Pottu Amman, Col. 
Shankar, Tamilselvan, 
and others, were known to frequently engage in what 
appeared to be excessive flattery towards their Leader.
This inclination for flattery was further highlighted in 
an incident shared by a former LTTE member with 
the Jaffna Monitor. On Prabhakaran's 50th birthday 
on November 26, 2004, Babu, alias 'Holser' Babu, 
the chief of Cheran Vanipam, an LTTE business 
outlet, organized a massive Pongal ceremony to mark 
the LTTE chief's birthday. Some LTTE members 
criticized Holser Babu's lavish Pongal celebration for 
Prabhakaran's 50th birthday as overly sycophantic 
and wasteful. They discreetly shared their disapproval 
among trusted circles within the LTTE, wary of 
potential repercussions. Interestingly, our source, 
who was with Prabhakaran at the time, revealed that 
when Prabhakaran learned about the grand Pongal 
ceremony, he reacted with visible happiness and 
delight, indicating his appreciation for such grand 
gestures.
Colonel Shankar: The LTTE's 
Infamous 'Thagaadu' and His 
Effects on Mahathaya
Colonel Shankar, in particular, was widely known 
for his flattery attitude towards his Leader. In the Sri 
Lankan Tamil context, the terms 'Thagaadu vaithal' 
(jfL itj;jy;) or 'Anduthal' (mz;Ljy;) describe 
acts of sneaking or snitching. Shankar earned the 
nickname 'Thagaadu' Shankar or 'Andal Master' for his 
tendency to snitch on others within the LTTE to his 
boss. Even today, former high-ranking LTTE officers, 
whether living in Sri Lanka after rehabilitation or those 
who have escaped abroad, still refer to him by the 
moniker 'Thagaadu' Shankar in their conversations. To 
write this series of articles, I engaged in an extensive 
discussion with a former high-ranking member of the 
LTTE. Throughout our conversation, this individual 
repeatedly referred to Shankar as 'Thagadu' Shankar. 
The consistent use of this nickname, which essentially 
means a snitch or informant, highlights Shankar's 
particular reputation and perception among his peers 
in the LTTE.
Shankar reportedly harboured a dislike for Mahathaya, 
although the reasons are known only to Shankar 
himself. Credible sources revealed to the Jaffna 
Monitor that Shankar systematically reported negative

information about Mahathaya to Prabhakaran. This 
snitching likely influenced Prabhakaran's perceptions 
and decisions regarding Mahathaya.
A valuable source shared an intriguing anecdote with 
the Jaffna Monitor, revealing an incident highlighting 
the internal dynamics and trust issues within the 
LTTE leadership. The incident occurred during a 
period of peace with the Premadasa government. 
'Thenisai' Sellappa, a well-known Tamil folk music 
exponent and staunch supporter of the LTTE, visited 
an LTTE-controlled area from India. One of the events 
organized by the LTTE took place on the city grounds 
in Vavuniya in front of the Vavuniya court. Mahathaya 
was giving the introductory speech at the stadium. 
During this event, the source encountered Shankar, 
who had a friendly rapport with the source. He 
pointed to Mahathaya and remarked, "Michael made 
a mistake worthy of killing him." Mahathaya was also 
called Michael, but only by a few people within the 
LTTE, including Shankar. This statement piqued the 
source's curiosity, prompting further inquiry.
Shankar then disclosed critical operational details 
about the LTTE's internal communication system. He 
explained that in those days, every LTTE base had a 
yellow box where fighters could directly write letters to 
their Leader, Prabhakaran. These letters were meant to 
be confidential and directly delivered to Prabhakaran 
without any intermediaries reading them. While in 
the Jaffna region, a dedicated LTTE cadre loyal to 
Prabhakaran was appointed to collect these letters 
from each Base, this system was not feasible in more 
remote areas like the Vanni region. In these places, the 
Base in charge, who had a key to the yellow box, was 
responsible for collecting and forwarding the letters 
to Prabhakaran. According to Shankar, Mahathaya 
violated this protocol by opening and reading these 
letters before they reached Prabhakaran, a significant 
breach of trust and loyalty in the eyes of both 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE.
The source believed that Shankar, known for his 
tendency to snitch on Prabhakaran, would have 
undoubtedly informed him about this incident. This 
report would have further increased the resentment

and insecurity that Prabhakaran already 
harboured towards Mahathaya. Our source 
believes that this event implies Mahathaya's 
readiness to defy Prabhakaran, showing a 
willingness to breach established protocols 
and ignore Prabhakaran's orders. Such actions 
represented a notable departure from the strict 
loyalty and obedience demanded within the 
LTTE's hierarchical framework.
Balasingham's Reservations 
About Mahathaya
Anton Balasingham, the chief strategist of 
the LTTE, also harbored a dislike for Mahathaya, as 
revealed by sources close to the LTTE. Affectionately 
known within the organization as Bala Anna, 
Balasingham had specific reservations about Shankar 
and Mahathaya despite his occasional differences 
with various figures, including Prabhakaran. Credible 
sources indicate that Balasingham's distrust and 
disbelief in Mahathaya might have influenced the 
mindset of the LTTE's Leader, Prabhakaran. An 
interesting story shared by our source highlights 
Balasingham's influence. Following Mahathaya's 
execution, Prabhakaran was considering appointing 
Shankar as the new head of the political wing. 
However, Balasingham, who strongly opposed both 
Shankar and Mahathaya, intervened. His intervention 
was crucial in convincing Prabhakaran to select 
Thamilselvan as the LTTE's political commissar in 
1994.
Pottu Amman's Ascendancy and 
Mahathaya's Decline in the LTTE
Sources closely associated with Mahathaya describe 
him as somewhat immature in many aspects. His 
nature as a people person rendered him highly 
emotional, and he was known for harbouring 
grudges. Like a child, this tendency to take offence 
quickly led to him ceasing communication with 
other leaders within the LTTE. Figures like Shankar, 
Anton Balasingham, and other prominent members 
developed a dislike for Mahathaya primarily due to 
these childish behaviours.
Another individual who disliked Mahathaya within 
the LTTE was Pottu Amman, the intelligence chief 
of the LTTE; however, in the case of Pottu Amman, 
his dislike for Mahathaya was not just a matter of 
personal animosity. Credible sources conveyed to the 
Jaffna Monitor that Pottu Amman's aversion towards 
Mahathaya was driven by his own agenda. They 
point out that Pottu Amman had a particular plan 
concerning Mahathaya. Observing the LTTE's history, 
they mentioned a clear, direct correlation between the 
decline of Mahathaya and the ascent of Pottu Amman 
within the organization's hierarchy.
Pottu Amman assumed leadership of the LTTE's 
intelligence wing in mid-1988, holding the position 
for 21 years until the LTTE's military defeat in May 
2009. While his role as second-in-command was never 
formally declared, he effectively held this position 
by 2009. Initially, during Mahathaya's tenure as the 
LTTE's number 2, Pottu Amman's presence within 
the organization was less prominent. However, with 
the gradual decline of Mahathaya's influence, Pottu 
Amman's stature within the LTTE grew, ultimately 
leading him to become the de facto second-in-
command.
This article will be continued 
in our next issue, where we 
delve further into the story.
