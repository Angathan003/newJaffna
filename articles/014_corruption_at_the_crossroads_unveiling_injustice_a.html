I
n the heart of Vavuniya, a concerning narrative unfolds 
daily at the local passport office, casting a long shadow 
over the integrity of public service institutions in Sri 
Lanka. Allegations of rampant bribery and corruption in 
the passport issuance process have surfaced, portraying a 
system deeply marred by inefficiency and injustice.
Every morning, before the crack of dawn, hopeful 
individuals from various districts of the Northern 
Province line up in two queues at the Vavuniya 
Passport Office. They come seeking what should be a 
straightforward service—the issuance of one-day or 
regular passports. However, the reality they encounter is 
far from simple or fair.

Reports indicate that a corrupt nexus between 
office staff, security personnel, and even police 
officers has turned a routine administrative 
process into a lucrative racket. Instead of a 
first-come, first-served basis, the standard 
procedure, numbers are allegedly sold to the 
highest bidders. Individuals who refuse or are 
unable to pay bribes up to and exceeding 5,000 
rupees are often forced to wait for hours, only 
to leave empty-handed.
This system not only disenfranchises the 
average citizen but also erodes trust in public 
institutions. The passport office, meant to be 
a gateway to the world for Sri Lankans, has 
become a barrier littered with exploitation. 
The involvement of police in this scheme 
adds a layer of betrayal to the public's trust. 
Supposedly there to uphold the law, these 
officers are instead reported to be protecting 
and participating in corrupt practices, 
overseeing a daily exchange that privileges 
the wealthy and well-connected over ordinary 
citizens.
Following reports in the Jaffna Tamil media 
about corruption at the Vavuniya passport 
office, law enforcement has taken swift and 
much-needed action despite the alleged 
involvement of police officers in the corrupt 
practices. It is suggested that these crimes 
occurred with the tacit approval of some 
members of the police force. However, 
the growing media attention forced the 
police to act as though they were hearing 
of these corrupt practices for the first time. 
Consequently, police reported that six 
individuals were arrested in front of the 
passport office, signalling a public stance 
against the malpractice. Furthermore, Senior 
Police Inspector Jayathilaka of the Vavuniya 
Police Station's Crime Prevention Unit has 
issued a public notice. He urges citizens to 
report any suspicious activities by contacting 
him at his official phone number, 0718593520 
if they witness further malpractices in the 
coming days. 
Monitor Memo
T
he Department of Immigration and 
Emigration has issued a warning about 
the emergence of counterfeit websites that 
mimic the appearance of the newly launched 
online visa application portal, www.
srilankaevisa.lk. These fraudulent sites have 
been deceiving people into making payments 
through them.
In a statement, the Department encourages 
everyone to ensure they are using the 
official online visa application system by 
accessing the e-Visa link directly from www.
immigration.gov.lk. This precaution is to 
guarantee the security and authenticity of 
their visa applications.
The new online visa system, which was 
officially launched on April 17th, aims to 
streamline the application process for visitors 
and residents alike, enhancing the efficiency 
and security of immigration services.

Chamari Athapaththu, Sri Lanka's formidable cricketing powerhouse, 
has reclaimed her position at the pinnacle of the ICC Women's ODI 
Batting Rankings following a historic innings. Athapaththu's unbeaten 
195 against South Africa in Potchefstroom—an awe-inspiring display 
that marked her ninth ODI century—was instrumental in levelling the 
ICC Women's Championship Series at 1-1.
This record-breaking knock is now celebrated as the highest individual 
score in a successful run-chase in Women's ODI history, propelling 
her past England's all-rounder Natalie Sciver-Brunt to regain the top 
spot—a position she briefly held from July 3 to 12, 2023, before being 
surpassed by Beth Mooney and subsequently by Sciver-Brunt.

In that same series, former number one 
Laura Wolvaardt of South Africa showcased 
her batting brilliance with an unbeaten 184, 
propelling South Africa to a formidable 301 for 
five in the third ODI. This stellar performance 
elevated Wolvaardt two places to third in the 
batting rankings, highlighting the intense 
rivalry among the world's elite batters.
The series underscored individual excellence 
and illuminated the dynamic shifts within 
the ICC rankings. West Indies captain Hayley 
Mathews, also a captain-opener like Chamari, 
surged in both the batting and all-rounder 
rankings. Her remarkable double of 140 not 
out and three wickets for 17 runs in the series 
opener against Pakistan in Karachi propelled 
her seven places to 11th among batters and to 
second place among all-rounders.
Other players, too, ascended the rankings. 
Stafanie Taylor of the West Indies moved up 
two places to 18th, while Pakistan's Bismah 
Maroof edged up to 27th. In the bowling 
ranks, Pakistan's left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal 
climbed six places to 17th after claiming three 
wickets in the first two matches against the 
West Indies. Similarly, West Indies' Connell 
ascended three spots to 25th, and teammate 
Chinelle Henry rose six places to 36th. Sri 
Lanka's Kavisha Dilhari and Pakistan's Umm-
e-Hani also advanced significantly, moving up 
to 48th and 60th, respectively.
Chamari Athapaththu's prowess at the crease 
is not merely effective—it's a spectacle of 
strategic and skilful play that captivates 
audiences and intimidates opponents. 
Renowned for her aggressive batting style, 
Chamari masterfully blends traditional shots 
with innovative strokes. Her remarkable 
wrist work allows her to manoeuvre the ball 
deftly, exploiting gaps in densely packed field 
settings. Equally impressive is her footwork; 
Chamari effortlessly advances down the 
pitch, transforming well-pitched deliveries 
into scoring opportunities. Her performances 
not only demonstrate her technical acumen 
but also her thrilling approach to the game, 
solidifying her status as a cricketing legend.</p>
