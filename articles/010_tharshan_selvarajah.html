n an inspiring turn of events, Tharshan 
Selvarajah, a Tamil baker originally from Sri 
Lanka who has been calling France his home 
since 2006, is set to carry the Olympic torch 
in this year's relay, marking a historic moment 
as the first Srilankan to participate in such a 
prestigious role.
Tharshan, whose culinary skills have endeared 
him to the heart of Paris, came into the 
limelight last year when he clinched the title 
for the best baguette in the city. Competing 
against 176 other entries, his creation not only 
won him a prize of €4,000 but also the honour 
of supplying his baguettes to the presidential 
palace—an accolade that speaks volumes about 
his mastery.
This year, Tharshan's journey takes an even 
more illustrious path as he joins the ranks of 
10,000 torchbearers in a relay that will weave 
through over 400 French towns and territories, 
including picturesque locales like Guadeloupe, 
Martinique, New Caledonia, and Réunion. 
The torch's journey will culminate at the grand 
opening ceremony of the Paris Olympic Games 
on July 26.
In a conversation with a media outlet, 
Tharshan Selvarajah shared his excitement and 
astonishment at being chosen as a torchbearer. 
"It was a pleasant surprise, and I feel incredibly 
fortunate," he remarked.

O
n the 17th of March, 1996, a day when Sri Lanka defied all 
odds to be crowned World Champions, the team's collective 
effort was undeniable. However, the contribution of one man 
cannot be overlooked. In fact, a scarcity of superlatives emerges 
when attempting to describe the impact this one individual had on 
the cricketing fortunes of a cricket-crazy island.
If the 17th of March, 1996, hadn't unfolded the way it did, the story 
of Sri Lanka Cricket might have been quite different. Perhaps we 
would have remained a much-loved minnow forever. You never 
know. But a man, short in stature yet inexplicably humongous in 
presence, made all the difference on that beautiful day.
Aravinda De Silva. A genius? No, something far beyond that. If one 
hasn't watched him play, it might be amusing to hear someone like

Sangakkara, a man literally worshipped 
by the world, speak of Aravinda as 
belonging to a different stratosphere. 
When someone as articulate and astute 
as Sangakkara makes such statements, 
they deserve careful analysis.
To decode Aravinda's greatness, I need 
only point to two days in 1996: the Semi-
Final and Final of the World Cup. The 
final cannot be fully appreciated without 
acknowledging the impact of the Semi-
Final. Aravinda's semi-final performance 
was a masterful counterattack, a display 
of skill that would have exhausted 
the abilities of mere mortals or even 
geniuses. While cricket superstars like 
Akram, Ponting, Gilchrist, Stokes, 
Dhoni, and Gambhir delivered on the big 
day in the World Cup Finals, Aravinda 
did it in two knockout games. Silencing 
100,000 fans at Kolkata was the stuff of 
superstardom—a feat so monumental 
it could have allowed him to rest on his 
laurels for years. Yet, he outdid even that 
in the very next game, and not by a small 
margin. Let that sink in.
In cricket history, no team had successfully chased 
down the target in a situation like this. Both 
openers were dismissed early, and Gurusinghe was 
at the crease, holding on but far from dominating. 
In this context, Aravinda De Silva's unbeaten 107 
spearheaded the Sri Lankan chase—a feat never 
seen before. While Dhoni had Gambhir and 
Stokes had Buttler, Aravinda soared above his 
colleagues. It was a knock many can only dream of, 
a performance that could alone attest to Aravinda's</p>

greatness. However, that's where we often 
overlook his equally vital contribution with the 
ball.
When Taylor and Ponting were batting 
together, with nearly 140 runs on the board, Sri 
Lanka's chances seemed all but extinguished 
before they even started batting. It was a 
scene reminiscent of the crumbling dream 
in the Semi-Final. At this critical juncture, 
Aravinda, picking up Taylor and Ponting in 
quick succession, delivered the unexpected 
killer blow that Australia surely hadn't 
anticipated from him. His spell, yielding three 
crucial wickets, set the stage for Sri Lanka. 
That alone was a display of greatness on the 
most significant day of his nation's cricketing 
journey, a feat that leaves you in awe.
Now, add that century on top of his show with 
the ball. Combine both those feats with his 
Semi-Final knock. Just let that sink in. Close 
your eyes, envision those achievements, and 
ask yourself: Can anyone replicate such a feat? 
I'm afraid the answer is no. 
Aravinda wasn't a commercial icon; he wasn't 
part of the big three. Romanticizing his feat 
and adding glamour won't sell. But if it did, it 
would be the greatest cricketing success story. 
Regardless, those who witnessed this sequence 
of events are truly blessed. It was a privilege 
to watch the great man perform great deeds. 
Aravinda was a legend. On those two days, he 
scripted his legacy and signed off in style.
Those who lived it know its true value. And 
when one wonders why the likes of Sangakkara 
hold Aravinda in such high esteem, perhaps 
the answer is simple: just look at those two 
games, and you'll understand why.
Aravinda De Silva isn't just a name. It's an 
emotion—a legacy so profound that words 
scarcely do it justice.</p>

Story
Translated from the original Tamil 
short story Aṉulā  (mDyh) from 
the 1964 collection of short stories 
titled akkā (mf;fh)

he was the reason for my arrogance. It is not that I 
was chronically arrogant. But a certain cockiness 
shrouded over my eyes.
Any sign of anger in my face scared her, making her 
eyes dart hither and thither.
That made me feel smug.
I don’t believe in love. There can indeed be sexual 
attraction between a man and a woman — but I have 
never believed in the concept of love.
Even when I was caught amid the vortex of love, I</p>

had this nagging doubt “is this love?” right till 
the end.
But it didn’t appear that Aṉulā was ever 
encumbered with any such doubt. She wanted 
to love me wholeheartedly, and she did. She 
didn’t seem to care about the potential fallout 
of being in love.
It was two months until my transfer was due. 
Thereafter, I will retreat to a post office in 
some other corner of this island nation. The 
room that I am living in now will become 
vacant.
But what about Aṉulā ’s heart?
I played with that tender heart, getting myself 
ready for a new test.
They say that one can never foretell when 
love would spring forth. Just as the day is 
born from the night, love too is born at some 
instant.
But I think I can put my finger on the exact 
instant when our love was born.
Lunch was the only meal for which Silva 
didn’t sit down with me. I was used to eating 
lunch by myself. I had also gotten accustomed 
to their food to the extent that I cannot eat 
without achchāṟu served by Aṉulā ’s own 
hand.
My plate was on the table. She served 
standing, ladling out one item after another 
with a spoon. While I was eating with my 
head down, something nudged me in my 
unconscious mind. Startled, I looked up.
She stood there with her eyes fixated on 
me. There was a certain untypical glamor 
dominating her eyes.
She smiled gently.
That smile was new to me.
Until then she had been a little girl. Suddenly, 
it felt like I was allured by her, standing at the 
threshold of youth.
That smile was pregnant with meaning.</p>
<hr />
<p>Day by day, her beauty was on a dangerously 
upward trajectory. She decked herself up in 
myriad ways before she appeared in front of 
me. Sometimes her decorations even seemed a 
little childish to me.
But I enjoyed admiring her looks. I found my 
thoughts dwelling on her without conscious 
effort. My love grew steadily.
That is when she made that mistake. Her 
love went out of control. She could not bear 
to be separated from me even for an instant. 
Neglecting even her filial duties, she became 
one with me.
It slowly dawned on me that her love is greater 
than mine. That is when my arrogance was 
born.
Once I realized that she cannot live without 
me even for an instant, I started to gradually 
grow indifferent towards her.
Even her slightest flaws started to magnify in 
my eyes.
My harsh words wounded her gentle heart. 
Often, I intentionally spoke harshly just to 
see the suffering on her face, deriving some 
perverse pleasure from it.
She didn’t find this behavior strange. Perhaps 
she thought this was my nature; she didn’t find 
it a shortcoming. She was content with what 
she received.
She didn’t think twice about openly 
demonstrating that she couldn’t live without 
me.</p>

<hr />
<p>Silva’s profession was dyeing photos and 
selling them. Sometimes Aṉulā helped her 
father out by doing some dyeing herself. That 
must have been the case that day. When my 
usual time for returning home came around, 
she went inside to wash her hands and waited 
for me.
No matter how hard she washed her hands, the 
dye wouldn’t disappear so easily.
She ran to the entrance to stand in front of me; 
when she saw me, her face lit up in a bright 
smile, full of joy.
I wore a stern expression and said, “what is 
this stink — were you dyeing?” with disgust 
in my voice.
Her face fell. I became inexplicably happy in 
torturing that tender heart.
But her sadness never persisted for long. Even 
the hint of a smile from me was enough for 
her to forsake all her worries and seek refuge 
in my company.</p>

She, who didn’t even know how to be shy. Is it 
her childlike nature that attracted me to her?</p>
<hr />
<p>I was lying on the easy chair reading 
something. She came by, leaned on the easy 
chair frame and repeated the one or two Tamil 
words she knew as if she was reading along 
with me. It was beautiful to hear her speak 
Tamil. As she bent down to read, one of her 
long plaits tickled my chest.
I couldn’t bring myself to look at her with 
anger. I raised my head. Fear appeared in 
her eyes. She was beautiful even when she 
was afraid. Sometimes I wondered if I often 
became angry at her just to enjoy this beauty.
Her anxious eyes were fixed on me.
“Anu, are you going to leave or not?”
 She regarded me wretchedly. Her eyes welled 
up. My heart relented a little with pity.
I am not sure what made me say it, “Anu, sing 
me a song”, I said.
I don’t know why I asked for a song. I</p>

thought the request would drive her into an 
embarrassed silence.
But no sooner had I finished speaking than she 
started singing. All those days, I had no idea 
that she could sing.
Standing straight in front of me, like a well-
behaved school kid reciting for a teacher, she 
was singing.
It was a Sinhala song that started with “I am a 
king’s daughter”.
“We had a thousand elephants.
A thousand horses.
Ample wealth.
Our fame spread everywhere.
But what did it matter?
Where is all that wealth and fame?” the song 
continues.
My mind conjured up the image of Aṉulā as 
a king’s daughter. I was so immersed in my 
thoughts that I didn’t even realize that the song 
had ended.
She took a step forward and regarded me as if 
she was asking “how was the song?”
I was startled.
I gently tapped her cheeks and said, “your 
song is just as beautiful as you are”.
That was the only thing I ever did that filled 
her with so much joy.
The transfer order arrived. Aṉulā must have 
overheard when I conveyed the news to Silva.
“Anu”
She was nowhere to be seen. I stepped outside 
to look for her. As I expected, she was sitting 
under the longan tree crying. That tree fruits 
only once every five years. It was due to 
fruit the following year. She was so looking 
forward to plucking a longan fruit to give me.
I did not tell her to stop crying. If I had, she 
would have immediately stopped crying. She 
was awaiting my command even to cry.
“Anu”
She lightly moved the hands that were 
covering her face.
“Anu, I do have to leave.”
“Then I will come with you.”
“You?”
“Yes, why can’t I come?”
She wasn’t toying with me; she spoke 
sincerely. If I had said yes, she would have left 
with me.
“Anu, are you a baby?”
She then raised her face and looked at me 
dolefully. Her glance was filled with an 
uncontrollable sorrow.
“Are you really going to leave me?” she 
started to weep.
My decision must have taken her by total 
surprise.
After that she went straight to bed without 
speaking to me.
The next day, I was packing up. Aṉulā walked 
in with her hands behind her back. She 
dropped something secretly into my bag and 
looked at me eagerly.</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

“Anu, what is this?”
It was the little Buddha statue that she had 
bought during the Kandy perahera last year. It 
was made of ivory. I remembered how excited 
she was to buy that statue. I almost couldn’t 
bring myself to accept her gift. But with one 
look at her eyes, I changed my mind.
“Will you never come here again?”
Looking at her face, I was overcome with pity.
“Anu, how can I stay away from you — you 
will make me kiribath won’t you?
When I finally took my leave, she held her 
face against my ear and asked, “do you really 
not like me?” amid sobs.
Even then, I couldn’t discern the feminine 
shyness in her face.
Wasn’t her love deep? Otherwise, how could 
she bid me goodbye with a smiling face?
But I had long harbored this deep-seated 
desire to part from her. I must have had the 
unquenchable urge to experience the pain of 
separation.
But I didn’t have the endurance to match the 
urge. Aching thoughts of Aṉulā filled my 
heart. I was unable to function. I was about to 
go crazy.
If my grief was such, Anu, how could her 
tender heart bear her pain?
I couldn’t bear the burden that I had willingly 
taken on.
She sat by the pillar with her hands around her 
knees, singing,
“I am a king’s daughter.”
In my mind’s eye, I saw her trepidatious eyes. 
What has she ever received from me except 
fear?</p>
<hr />
<p>I had naively presumed that Aṉulā was just 
an unimportant blip in my long life. But the 
tables turned so quickly that it was as if my 
life itself was about her. I became keenly 
aware that every moment without Aṉulā was 
one of anguish. My heart yearned for her. 
Admitting defeat was embarrassing.
Where did all that arrogance go?</p>
<hr />
<p>A great weight pressed down on my heart.
My eager eyes spotted Aṉulā already from far 
away.
She was sitting with her legs folded. My 
shadow must have entered her field of vision 
first. Her startled eyes were momentarily 
fixated on me. But a nameless sorrow engulfed 
her face right thereafter.
She ran inside.
Some dyed pictures were drying in the sun. 
At a distance, the familiar longan tree was 
shedding a flower or two. Silva’s sarong, 
that same old sarong, was drying on the 
clothesline.
Aṉulā was nowhere to be seen.
“Anu”
Even then it was authority that was dominant 
in my voice, not love. I went inside. She was 
rubbing sand onto her hands, trying to wash 
the dye away.
“Anu”
She didn’t even lift her head.</p>

“Anu, are you cross with me?”
She gently lifted her head and shook it. Her 
characteristic smile did not appear.
“Where is your father?”
“He went to New Town.”
It was just questions and answers. The former 
fondness has disappeared.
Where is my old Aṉulā?
The fragrance of kiribath wafted his way. The 
calendar was four days behind. The place 
where the Buddha statue stood was stark in its 
emptiness.
There was an unopened letter on the table, 
addressed to Silva.
“Anu, aren’t you going to light the lamp?”
She lit a portable oil lamp, placed it on the 
table, and went away to stand at a distance.</p>

A somewhat dirty blouse, sāri tied with the 
characteristic Sinhala flare at the hip; a face 
engulfed with sorrow. Even then she reminded 
me of a Sigiriya fresco.
For the first time, I was floundering in front 
of her. I was unable to order her around, nor 
admit defeat.
I regarded her piteously. When I moved the 
lamp to see her face better, my hand shook.
“Don’t you like that I have come to visit you?”
Her face fell. She bent her head silently.
“Father is discussing my marriage to 
Piyadāsa….”
An unfamiliar pain stabbed my heart. I 
couldn’t even imagine the prospect of Aṉulā 
being betrothed to someone else. Nevertheless, 
I couldn’t help recognizing the faint sense of 
relief somewhere deep within my heart.
I looked at Aṉulā. In the dim light of the lamp, 
her eyes glistened. I could not ignore it in the 
same way I used to ignore her tears pouring 
down. It seemed like that single teardrop 
would shatter my heart. I did not want her to 
cry. Had it been the old Aṉulā, tears would not 
have moved me.
But my heart did not have the strength to 
withstand Aṉulā’s tears.
“Anu! Will you sing that song?”
She remained quiet. I could not bear that 
stubborn silence.
Even though I did not ask her wholeheartedly, 
I was not prepared to accept the fact that she 
rejected my request.
“Anu, will you not sing for me …?”
She wanted to say something. Her lips 
trembled.
“For how long am I going to beg you?”
The long fingers in her right hand softly shut 
my mouth.
I could smell the faint odor of dye.
Slowly pulling at the threads on the gunny 
sack, she began to sing softly.
“I am a king’s daughter.”
As she sang, I kept staring at her eyes lit up by 
the flickering lamp. When she got to the last 
words of her song, I felt that all the sad music 
in this world had blended into her voice.
“All my jewelry is bronze, not gold;
 My saree is torn, not silk;
 Still,
 Don’t laugh at me, passerby!
 I am a king’s daughter –
 I am… I am …”
She could not bring herself to sing those last 
few lines. Instead, she heaved a gentle sigh.
When did the lamp go out?
There wasn’t even the whisper of wind.</p>
