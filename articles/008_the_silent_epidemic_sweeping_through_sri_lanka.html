The Silent Epidemic 
Sweeping Through Sri Lanka
I
n a disturbing trend that has shaken the Northern Province of Sri 
Lanka, this year commenced with the tragic deaths of four young 
individuals, aged 20 to 30, linked to drug addiction. One poignant case 
was a young youth from Chavakachcheri who died during a drug party 
celebrating his release from prison, highlighting the unyielding grip of 
drug abuse in our society.

on a major drug trafficking route. Narcotics from Afghanistan,

Pakistan, and India are smuggled via the 
ocean, exploiting the challenges of policing 
vast maritime areas. This has transformed 
Sri Lanka into a pivotal hub in the global 
drug trade, posing severe challenges for law 
enforcement and public health.
International maritime law allows nations to 
police waters within 12 nautical miles of their 
coastlines. Beyond this, the high seas become 
a haven for traffickers. In Sri Lanka, traffickers 
transport drugs near maritime boundaries, 
transferring them onto smaller boats to evade 
detection. This method, coupled with the use 
of fishing vessels, complicates the interception 
of these illegal cargoes.
Adding to the complexity is the alleged 
involvement of influential figures in facilitating 
the drug trade. This metaphorical "guard 
eating the crop" scenario points to potential 
complicity within security forces, undermining 
efforts to combat drug trafficking.
The 'Yukthiya' operation, Sri Lanka's 
significant crackdown on drug abuse, 
commenced on December 17 and spanned 
fifty days, leading to the arrest of over 100,000 
individuals for drug-related offences. While 
highlighting the government's resolve, it 
also sparked debate over human rights 
implications.
During 'Yukthiya', substantial drug seizures 
were reported, indicating the magnitude of the 
narcotics challenge. Most arrested individuals 
were cannabis users, predominantly males 
aged 25 to 29. The ethnic breakdown</p>

showed 75.9% Sinhalese, 9% Tamil, and 7% 
Muslim, with the majority being labourers or 
unemployed.
In the Northern and Eastern provinces, there's 
heightened concern over drug abuse, especially 
among the Tamil-speaking population. Critics 
suggest the prolonged military presence, 
initially a countermeasure against the LTTE, 
is now facilitating intensified nationalist 
measures disguised as anti-drug trafficking 
efforts. Despite significant drug-related arrests 
and seizures, the continuous discovery of 
unidentified boats and drug packages suggests 
persistent trafficking activities.
Combating this scourge requires more than 
official measures. It demands the involvement 
of youth, families, and communities, alongside 
effective law enforcement and treatment 
programs. As a nation, we must tackle this 
challenge head-on, understanding that the 
solution lies not only in arrests and seizures 
but in addressing the underlying social and 
economic factors fueling this epidemic.</p>

Mahathaya's Saga:
Power, Paranoia, and Politics in the LTTE

Romance in the Rebel Ranks: Thiyagu and the 
Female Fighter's Forbidden Love
It's worth noting an incident involving Kirupan, who was, in 
fact, at the juncture of starting the RAW phobia within the 
LTTE.
In 1987, during the Indian Army's siege of Jaffna, LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran managed to escape to Niththikaikulam in 
the Mulaitivu district. He crossed the Nayaru Bridge with a 
highly trusted group of about 20 bodyguards. Accompanying 
Prabhakaran were Sornam, Kirupan, Thiyagu, 'Pampu' Ajith, 
Series

and a team of loyal bodyguards, all known for 
their unwavering loyalty. Thiyagu, originally 
named Kanthaiya Kirupakaran and hailing 
from Arasadi, Sangathanai, Chavakachcheri, 
is notable for being the first cousin of S. P. 
Tamilselvan, who later became the leader of 
the LTTE's political wing. Thiyagu's sister, 
Captain Ajitha (Kanthaiya Sukunarani), also 
served as a fighter in the LTTE during the 
same period.
The 1-4 Base Camp was established by the 
LTTE at Niththikaikulam. The term '1:4' 
originates from the encrypted communication 
codes used by the LTTE. This code was part 
of a systematic coding system employed for 
secure communications via wireless high-
frequency communication sets. Each district 
commander within the LTTE was equipped 
with a uniquely coded wireless set. For 
instance, Maththaiya's set was coded 'Three 
Seven, 3:7,' Pottu Amman's as '8:4,' and 
Banu's as '4:6.' Similarly, '1:4' was the code 
for Prabhakaran's wireless set. This code also 
became the symbolic name for his base, which 
was established in the Niththikaikulam forest. 
Likewise, the base established by Maththaiya 
near Omandai, located near Koliyangkulam 
along the A-9 highway, was coded '3:7.'
The 1:4 base was not a singular entity but 
rather a composite of various separate units 
and camps. Within this complex, the area 
where Prabhakaran resided was named 
'Punitha Bhoomi' (Gdpj G+kp), translating 
to 'holy land.' This section was also home 
to his most trusted associates, including 
Thiyagu. Additionally, the 1:4 base included 
several other notable sections: 'Sencholai', 
which served as the starting point of the

base; 'Amuthasurabi' (mKjRugp), tasked 
with food provision; 'Nasakari' (ehrfhup), 
responsible for bomb and mine production; 
and 'Neethithevan' (ePjpNjtd;), dedicated to 
delivering justice. Sources present at the 1:4 
base during its operation informed the Jaffna 
Monitor that nine distinct units were within 
the camp each assigned a specific function.
The 'Punitha Bhoomi' base, where 
Prabhakaran resided, was highly secure and 
meticulously concealed within the larger 1:4 
base. Sources who were at the 1:4 base during 
its operation disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor 
that even those living within the camp had 
limited knowledge about the Punitha Bhoomi 
base, including details about its location and 
methods of entry. 
Meanwhile, within the 1:4 base, a separate base 
exclusively for female fighters was established, 
named 'Vidiyal,' which means 'The Sunrise' 
in Tamil. Prabhakaran positioned it adjacent 
to his Punitha Bhoomi base to ensure these 
women fighters' safety and appropriate 
protection. This base was overseen by Major 
Sothiya (Maria Vasanthi Michael), in whose 
honour the formidable fighting force of the 
LTTE female guards – the Sothiya Regiment – 
was later formed.
Access to the women's camp, Vidiyal, was 
restricted, with other male members of 
the LTTE, including Prabhakaran himself, 
not permitted to enter the women's camp. 
A highly trusted individual was needed to 
relay messages between Vidiyal and Punitha 
Bhoomi. For this purpose, Thiyagu was 
appointed by Prabhakaran. He was responsible 
for carrying Prabhakaran's messages to the 
Vidiyal base and bringing back requests and 
news from the Vidiyal camp to him.
LTTE sources revealed that Thiyagu was a 
highly skilled fighter, particularly during the 
intense conflicts with the Indian Peace Keeping

Force (IPKF). These sources recollect a specific 
incident where the Indian Army conducted an 
unexpected landing near the 1-4 base using 
two helicopters. In this encounter, Thiyagu 
played a crucial role as part of the team that 
successfully shot down one of the helicopters, 
dealing a significant blow to the Indian Army.
Furthermore, a source who was present with 
Thiyagu at the 1:4 base conveyed to the Jaffna 
Monitor that Thiyagu possessed the qualities 
and capabilities to ascend to a commander's 
role in the LTTE in the future. A notable 
factor contributing to this potential was 
Prabhakaran's favorable opinion of him. The 
source emphasized that being liked and trusted 
by Prabhakaran was a key criterion for anyone 
aspiring to become a commander within the 
LTTE ranks.
Thiyagu's frequent visits to the Vidiyal camp 
led to a significant development in his personal 
life. During this time, he developed a romantic 
relationship with Yuliya, a female fighter who 
held a ranking position within the LTTE. As 
their relationship deepened, they became 
intimate, which resulted in Yuliya's pregnancy. 
It is believed that upon learning about the 
pregnancy, Thiyagu started planning an escape, 
not for himself, but for Yuliya.
His plan wasn't to abandon the LTTE but 
to discreetly send Yuliya to India under the 
pretext of seeking medical treatment. This 
strategy was plausible as it was a common 
practice for the LTTE to send fighters to India 
for medical attention, whether they were 
injured on the battlefield or fell ill in the forest. 
Thiyagu's intent was to ensure Yuliya's safety 
and well-being while maintaining the secrecy 
of their situation.

According to sources, Yulia skillfully 
pretended to be suffering from severe stomach 
pain while in the camp as part of the plan 
devised by Thiyagu. Thiyagu, who served as 
a messenger for Prabhakaran and the Vidiyal 
camp, utilized his position to communicate 
Yulia's condition to Prabhakaran. He suggested 
that she be sent to India for advanced medical 
care, highlighting the inadequacy of medical 
facilities in the forest to treat her supposed 
condition.
Following this recommendation, Yulia was 
initially transported to Alampil Semmalai. 
A former LTTE soldier, who was stationed 
at the Vidiyal base at the time, recounted to 
the Jaffna Monitor that female LTTE guards 
physically carried Yulia on a stretcher from 
the base to Alampil Semmalai. The journey to 
ensure her safe passage didn't end there; from 
Alampil Semmalai, she was taken by boat to 
Valvettithurai. The final leg of her journey to 
reach India involved another boat trip from 
Valvettithurai to Vedaranyam. This carefully 
orchestrated plan was executed to ensure 
Yulia's safe and discreet transfer to India under 
the guise of seeking medical treatment.
Accordingly, she was admitted to a hospital 
in Salem district, Tamil Nadu, trusted by the 
LTTE. At the hospital, the doctor discovered 
her pregnancy and informed Kirupan, who 
was overseeing LTTE operations in India. 
Kirupan then relayed the news to Prabhakaran. 
Upon hearing this, Prabhakaran ordered 
an investigation to determine the father of 
the child. Credible LTTE sources told Jaffna 
Monitor that the woman was moved from

the hospital to a secret LTTE location for 
interrogation by female fighters.
During the investigation, the pregnant fighter 
revealed that Thiyagu was the father of her 
child. Kirupan relayed this revelation to 
Prabhakaran via wireless communication. 
Subsequently, Thiyagu was arrested at the 
1-4 Base Camp. As Thiyagu was a bodyguard 
to Prabhakaran and always carried a loaded 
handgun, Sornam, Prabhakaran's chief 
bodyguard, meticulously planned the 
operation for Thiyagu's apprehension. It's 
typical for bodyguards to leave their guns 
behind while using the toilet or taking baths. 
Capitalizing on such a moment, the physically 
imposing Sornam apprehended Thiyagu from 
behind. A credible source at the Punitha 
Bhoomi base disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor 
that Prabhakaran did not fear Thiyagu would 
use his handgun against him or other LTTE 
members. However, there was a significant 
concern that Thiyagu might commit suicide 
using the gun, prompting Prabhakaran 
to order his arrest at a time when he was 
unarmed.
Sources reported to the Jaffna Monitor that 
upon learning he had been named as the father 
of the female fighter's unborn child, Thiyagu 
immediately confessed the truth. According 
to these sources, his prompt confession 
demonstrated his love for her. A source who 
was at the 1-4 base at the time suggested that, 
although it might seem illogical, Thiyagu 
could have easily denied any involvement 
if he did not truly love her. By confessing 
immediately, he appeared to be protecting the 
pregnant fighter's honour. If he had denied 
the allegations, it would have been nearly 
impossible for the LTTE to identify the child's 
father, particularly since conducting DNA tests 
was a difficult task at that time. This source 
strongly disputes the claims of other credible 
sources who suggested to the Jaffna Monitor 
that the relationship was driven by lust rather 
than love.
Credible sources at the 1-4 Base Camp 
revealed to the Jaffna Monitor that a majority 
of the female fighters from the Vidiyal camp, 
along with most members of Prabhakaran's 
inner circle, were insistent, subtly exerting 
significant pressure on him to impose the 
ultimate punishment to both. Another reliable 
source informed the Jaffna Monitor that 
prominent LTTE figures, such as deputy leader 
Mahathaya and early member Yogaratnam 
Yogi, who was also a close ally of Prabhakaran, 
advocated for the execution. This source 
suggested that Mahathaya and Yogi, being 
puritans, exerted considerable pressure on 
Prabhakaran, who was himself an ultra-
puritan.
A credible source who was at the Punitha 
Bhoomi base revealed a complex internal 
dilemma faced by Prabhakaran. Initially, he 
appeared hesitant to order the executions 
of Thiyagu and the female fighter, the 
source added. In an unprecedented move, 
Prabhakaran reportedly resorted to a public 
vote among the fighters to determine the fate 
of Thiyagu and the pregnant female fighter. 
The outcome was staggering, with the majority 
of the female fighters voting overwhelmingly 
for execution. 
This decision, as some LTTE sources suggest, 
was primarily motivated by concerns over 
a security and trust breach within the 
organization. A source who supported 
the decision to execute them argued with 
the Jaffna Monitor that Thiyagu and Yulia 
violated the basic disciplinary code of the 
LTTE. Thiyagu, being a trusted bodyguard 
of Prabhakaran, also breached a trust code. 
Additionally, by arranging for Yulia's transfer</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

to India, they compelled other female fighters 
to carry her on a stretcher through the forest 
to the seashore, significantly endangering 
the lives of other fighters. However, others 
interpreted the decision as a reflection of the 
LTTE's puritan ideology.
The female combatant was ultimately retrieved 
from India and brought back to the 1-4 base 
under the supervision of Prabhakaran's 
trusted associates. In a tragic turn of events, 
the pregnant woman and Thiyagu were 
executed in the remote Nithikaikulam forests 
by the very organization to which they had 
dedicated themselves. Thiyagu's execution 
was carried out by a group of selected male 
LTTE members, while the termination of the 
pregnant combatant's life was conducted by 
a group of selected female fighters from the 
Vidiyal camp, following direct orders from 
Prabhakaran.
Before departing for their execution, fully 
cognizant of their imminent end, the female 
fighter extended their final well-wishes to 
their comrades, including those tasked with 
carrying out her execution. She uttered, 'ey;yh 
,Uq;Nfh&gt; ftdkh ,Uq;Nfh' – 'Be well and 
be careful.' A female fighter from the camp 
shared with the Jaffna Monitor that, while the 
sentiment of 'be well' was comprehensible, 
the phrase 'ftdkh ,Uq;Nfh' (be careful) was 
somewhat perplexing to them.
A reliable informant confided to the Jaffna 
Monitor that the group of female fighters who 
both witnessed and took part in the execution 
were profoundly impacted by the ordeal. They 
returned to the Vidiyal camp engulfed in deep 
sorrow and distress, and they wept for hours.
Captain Ajitha (Kanthaiya Sukunarani), 
Thiyagu's younger sister and an LTTE cadre 
stationed at the Vidiyal camp at the time, 
was informed by the LTTE about her brother 
Thiyagu's impending execution, sources 
conveyed to the Jaffna Monitor. This news left 
her shattered, leading her to break down in 
tears. Following her brother's execution, Ajitha 
was engulfed in immense distress. Overcome 
with grief, she continuously wept and refrained 
from eating for three days.
Despite her profound grief, Captain Ajitha 
(Kanthaiya Sukunarani) did not leave the 
LTTE. Her unwavering commitment to the 
cause of freedom led her to continue fighting 
alongside the LTTE. Tragically, she was killed 
in a battle against the Sri Lankan army in 1990 
in Katuvan, Jaffna. She died alongside fellow 
LTTE fighters Samson, Stalin, Allan, Captain 
Asha, Rama, and Rathikala. In recognition 
of her sacrifice, the small lane leading to 
her house, 'Varathan Illam,' in Arasadi, 
Sangathanai, Chavakachcheri, was later 
renamed 'Sukunarani Lane' in her honour, 
commemorating her martyrdom.
A few credible sources, including former LTTE 
cadres, claim that Julia, was closely related to 
Prabhakaran's wife, Mathivathani. They assert 
that Julia was, in fact, Mathivathani's cousin, 
specifically the daughter of Mathivathani's 
father, Erampu's sister.
Another source, a friend of Prabhakaran 
who was not present at the 1-4 base during 
the incident, relayed to the Jaffna Monitor 
that Prabhakaran was later confronted with 
a haunting question by someone close to 
him. This individual asked Prabhakaran, 
'Ok, Thiyagu and the female fighter made 
mistakes and breached security protocols. You 
sentenced them to death. Granted, they were 
punished for their actions, but what wrong 
did the innocent unborn child commit to 
deserve death? How can you decide the fate of 
an unborn child who had nothing to do with</p>

these mistakes and did not participate 
in any wrongdoing?' This question, 
our source notes, heavy with moral 
complexity, reportedly left Prabhakaran 
without an answer.
We met a middle-aged woman who 
was once a young novice fighter in 
the Vidiyal camp when Thiyagu's 
saga happened. Her voice trembling 
with palpable anguish. Her words cut 
through the air like a sharp blade. 'Our 
liberation struggle, once a majestic 
edifice built upon the countless sacrifices 
of thousands of fighters, lay in ruins by 
2009 — shattered completely, from its 
deepest roots to its highest branches. 
This devastation, this utter annihilation 
is the bitter fruit of our own sins,' she 
declared with piercing intensity. Her 
eyes, mirrors of deep sorrow, reflected 
a soul tormented by the past. 'Within 
the confines of the organization, our 
vision was blurred; we couldn't see the 
moral decay, the egregious wrongs we 
were committing. It's only now, standing 
on the outside, looking back with eyes 
wide open, that the horrifying scale 
of our errors becomes painfully clear. 
We weren't just bystanders; we were 
complicit. We lent our voices to endorse 
the deaths of Thiyagu, Yulia, and an 
innocent, unborn child. That blood, 
that unforgivable sin, clings to us like 
a haunting specter, chasing us to our 
graves.' With these words, she let out a 
sigh so heavy, so laden with despair, it 
seemed to carry the weight of a thousand 
regrets, leaving a stinging silence in its 
wake.
