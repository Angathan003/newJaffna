ri Lanka's military history, 
often shaped by Sinhalese 
voices, has a rare exception: 
Major General (Retd.) 
Hermenagild Lakshman 
David. Born in Jaffna, the 
cultural heartland of Sri Lanka’s 
Tamil community, David rose to a two-star 
General—an achievement few Tamil officers 
have attained in the Sinhala-majority armed 
forces.
With a Doctorate in Business Administration, 
an MSc in Defence and Strategic Studies, and 
an MBA, he became a transformative figure

in Sri Lanka’s military education system. His 
legacy is etched in the institutions he shaped: 
as Chief Instructor and Commanding Officer 
at the Sri Lanka Military Academy, Deputy 
Vice-Chancellor at Kotelawala Defence 
University (KDU), and Commandant of the 
Defence Services Command and Staff College.
But it was during his command in Vavuniya 
in the mid-2000s that David truly stood 
apart. In a region predominantly Tamil, his 
leadership was a stark contrast to the military’s 
often harsh and oppressive approach during 
the civil war. Known for his humanity and 
generosity, he earned the respect and goodwill 
of the Tamil community—a rare achievement 
in a conflict marked by deep mistrust and 
suffering. While the Sri Lankan military’s 
actions during the war remain a source of pain 
and trauma for many Tamils, David’s tenure in 
Vavuniya offered a glimpse of what leadership 
could look like when rooted in empathy and 
fairness.
As the Founder Chairman of the Fr. H. S. 
David Foundation and former President 
of the Sri Lanka Institute of Training and 
Development, he has worked tirelessly to 
empower others. Now residing in Canada, he 
has taken on a new role as a licensed member 
of the Law Society, advocating for clients in 
tribunals and courts, and contributing to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.
In this intimate and revealing interview with 
Jaffna Monitor, Major General David breaks 
his silence and offers unparalleled insights into 
his journey.
Were there other Tamils who held the 
position of Major General in the Sri 
Lankan Army?
Yes, a few Tamils have held the prestigious 
rank of Major General in the Sri Lankan 
Army. In the history of independent Sri 
Lanka’s military, the first Ceylonese Army 
Commander was of Tamil origin—Colonel 
Anton Muttukumaru—who served as the 
Commander of the Ceylon Army. However, 
he was promoted to the rank of Major General 
only after his retirement.
The first Tamil to achieve this rank while 
in active service was Major General E. 
George Thevanayagam, an alumnus of St. 
John's College, Jaffna. In addition to him, 
approximately three to four other Tamils 
attained the rank of Major General during 
their service.
Who were the Tamil Major Generals 
during the war with the LTTE?
During the conflict, I was the only Tamil from 
the North to be promoted to the rank of Major 
General. Another notable figure was Major 
General Leonard Mark, who served as the 
Commander of Security Forces in Jaffna and 
Major General Anton Muttukumaru</p>

Mullaitivu. His father was Tamil, but Leonard, 
who hailed from Puttalam, may have received 
his education in Sinhala medium, which 
makes it difficult for him to converse in Tamil.
From the beginning, it seems that very 
few Tamils joined the Sri Lankan Army. 
When did you join, and what motivated 
you to enlist?
I joined the army in 1980, soon after 
completing my A/Ls. At the time, I was 
pursuing my ICMA qualification when I came 
across a newspaper advertisement announcing 
enlistment for Army Cadets to be trained in 
India.
My father, Ignatius David, a teacher and 
cadet master who served as a Lieutenant in 
the National Cadet Corps during his tenure 
at S. Thomas’ College, Gurutalawa, had a 
profound influence on my passion for the 
military. Adding to this inspiration was a 
family friend and relative, Colonel Rajayogam, 
who was then serving as the Engineer Advisor 
to General Sepala Attygalle. In fact, we were 
staying at his house in Jaffna, and his visits, 
along with his stories of military life, played a 
Major General E. George Thevanayagam (right), in full ceremonial uniform, shaking hands with a fellow officer during a formal 
military event.

pivotal role in shaping my decision to join the 
armed forces.
By 1980, ethnic riots against Tamils 
in 1956 and 1977 had already created 
deep divisions. With Tamil liberation 
movements gaining momentum and 
allegations that the military was being 
used to oppress and target Tamils, did 
you not see the army as part of the 
anti-Tamil machinery?
At that time, institutions like the army, navy, 
and air force were regarded as national 
establishments that primarily attracted 
sportsmen who joined the forces to advance 
their careers. These institutions were seen 
more as government services than as 
instruments of ethnic oppression.
Personally, I neither observed nor believed 
that they harbored systemic ethnic bias.
However, I did notice a growing disconnect 
between the public and law enforcement 
personnel. Firstly, many officers could not 
speak the local language. Secondly, Tamils 
were significantly underrepresented in 
the forces, not even in proportion to their 
ethnic ratio. Another contributing factor was 
the practice of transferring police officers 
to the North as a form of punishment, as 
these postings were considered difficult or 
undesirable. Many of these officers were sent 
on disciplinary grounds, and their lack of 
commitment naturally led to friction and 
misunderstandings, further damaging the 
image of the security forces in Tamil-majority 
areas.
Over time, this trend—combined with 
politically motivated decisions and the 
influence of certain commanders' promotions 
and appointments being tied to political 
agendas—began to alter public perception. 
These systemic changes gradually reinforced 
the narrative that the military was hostile 
toward Tamils. In fact, I was enlisted in the 
army while residing in Jaffna—something that, 
at the time, reassured me of the institution's 
impartiality.
At the time you joined the army, wasn’t 
it already seen as an anti-Tamil force?
Honestly, no. That perception did not exist 
when I joined the army. In my opinion, the 
turning point came in 1983 with the ambush 
in which 13 soldiers, including an officer, were 
killed. I later heard that one of the survivors 
is still alive and recently recounted his story. 
In fact, his testimony highlights how a Tamil 
doctor, Dr. Xavier from Jaffna Hospital, 
performed surgery on him and provided full 
assurance of his recovery.

I joined the army in 1980 and lived near the 
Hospital Road-Kandy Road junction in Jaffna 
until 1985. During this time, I did not face 
any threats or adversarial remarks from any 
militant group. There were no attempts on my 
life, and I did not have any personal security, 
even though my friends knew I had joined the 
army.
Meanwhile, my father, who was a teacher 
and lecturer, was a close friend of C.E. 
Anandarajah, the then-principal of St. 
John’s College, who was later assassinated by 
militants. After Mr. Anandarajah’s death, my 
father suffered a stroke. He was a strict teacher, 
the kind who wouldn’t hesitate to reprimand 
students, and he was devastated when he 
learned that the very younger generation he 
cared deeply for had killed such a respected 
educator. The loss shook him profoundly, 
leading him to decide to leave Jaffna. Until 
then, we had been living on Hospital Road, 
and I stayed with my family.
You were the founder and former 
chairman of the Fr. H. S. David 
Foundation. What is your 
relationship with Fr. (Dr.) 
Hyacinth Singarayar David, 
the renowned scholar who 
mastered more than 30 
languages?
He was my periyappa—my 
father’s elder brother—a man 
of extraordinary intellect and 
profound wisdom. His legacy 
is one that I hold close to my 
heart. Tragically, he passed 
away under heartbreaking 
circumstances.
I joined the army in the 1980s, a time marked 
by one of the darkest events in Jaffna’s 
history—the burning of the Jaffna Library 
in 1981. That horrific event, orchestrated 
by political thugs under the direct watch of 
certain politicians, remains etched in my 
memory. It was not merely a cultural loss for 
our people; it was a deeply personal tragedy 
for our families.
At the time, my Periyappa was residing at St. 
Patrick’s College. On that fateful night, other 
priests showed him the flames engulfing the 
library. Among the volumes reduced to ashes</p>

was his own research, painstakingly compiled 
over the years. The sight devastated him. As 
this was not an era of digital records, he faced 
the irretrievable loss of his life's academic 
work. We believe the shock and grief of this 
event contributed to his passing that very 
night.
In his honor, our family, along with well-
wishers, established the Fr. H. S. David 
Foundation. Under the leadership of the new 
chairman, Thushy David, the foundation has 
expanded its efforts, ensuring that Fr. David’s 
enduring contributions to humanity continue 
to inspire future generations.
Regarding the burning of the Jaffna 
Library, do you believe the military 
was responsible for its destruction?
It’s important to approach this issue with 
nuance. The burning of the Jaffna Library 
was not an act sanctioned by the military. 
Rather, it was carried out by a small group of 
antisocial elements, compounded by political 
thugs who get assistance from stooges in 
the forces, who acted more like mercenaries 
than representatives of their respective 
organizations. Their actions in no way 
reflected the values or conduct of the broader 
military forces.
Similarly, there were isolated incidents of 
theft and looting by certain individuals. 
However, it would be neither fair nor accurate 
to hold the entire institution accountable for 
the misconduct of a few. The overwhelming 
majority of military personnel remained 
committed to their duties and had no 
involvement in these regrettable events.
Your military career spans the entire 
timeline of Tamil militancy, from its 
inception, including the rise of the 
LTTE, to its annihilation in 2009. In 
your view, what factors contributed to 
the early flourishing of militancy?
After J.R. Jayewardene became President 
of Sri Lanka in 1977, he introduced the 
concept of an open economy, marking a 
significant departure from the socialist-
oriented policies of previous administrations. 
While this economic liberalization aimed to 
attract foreign investment and modernize 
the economy, it also heightened geopolitical 
tensions, particularly with India.
Backed by the USSR, India viewed Sri 
Lanka’s growing alignment with Western 
allies, particularly the United States, as 
both a strategic and geographical threat. 
In response, it resorted to covert measures 
to counterbalance this shift. One of India’s 
key strategies was to exploit Sri Lanka’s 
internal divisions. At the time, Tamil youth—
disillusioned by the policy of standardization, 
systemic discrimination, state-sponsored 
violence, and political marginalization—were 
already gravitating toward resistance.
According to researcher Rohan Gunaratna, 
India seized this opportunity to keep 
Jayewardene’s administration in check, using 
its intelligence agency, the Research and 
Analysis Wing (RAW), to provide training and 
support to Tamil militant groups. Ironically, 
while India was arming and training these 
groups, it was simultaneously providing 
military training to Sri Lankan armed forces.
Tamil militant groups received military 
training not only in India but also in Palestine, 
under the guidance of the Palestine Liberation 
Army (PLA). Without India’s intervention, 
it is unlikely that the Tamil militants' armed 
struggle would have reached the scale and 
sophistication it ultimately did.</p>

However, this intervention had far-reaching 
consequences. What began as an initiative 
under Indira Gandhi’s leadership to counter 
Jayewardene’s pro-Western policies eventually 
backfired. This miscalculated strategy 
culminated in the assassination of Rajiv 
Gandhi in 1991, as India's own creation turned 
into a Frankenstein’s monster.
You mentioned the politicization of the 
military. How did the politicization of 
the Sri Lankan military come about?
For much of its early history, the Sri Lankan 
military operated with minimal political 
interference, maintaining a professional 
and apolitical stance. However, this began 
to change under former President J.R. 
Jayewardene.
A key turning point came in 1981 when 
General Denis Perera, a widely respected 
and professional Army Commander, retired. 
Instead of adhering to the tradition of 
promoting senior officers based on merit, 
Jayewardene appointed his confidant and 
relative, Major General Tissa Weeratunga, 
as his successor. This decision marked the 
beginning of political influence creeping into 
the upper ranks of the military. Several senior 
Brigadiers were denied promotions, effectively 
forcing them into early retirement—a move 
widely perceived as politically motivated and 
aimed at consolidating loyalty within the 
armed forces.
Before becoming Army Commander, then-
Brigadier Weeratunga played a pivotal role in 
the government’s response to Tamil militancy 
in Jaffna. In 1979, he was appointed Overall 
Operational Commander with sweeping 
powers under the Prevention of Terrorism 
(Special Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979. His 
aggressive approach, rather than quelling 
tensions, further inflamed the situation, 
escalating violence instead of de-escalating it.
This trend continued in subsequent years, 
with political influence tightening its grip on 
military leadership. Only a handful of Army 
Commanders managed to resist this pressure. 
One notable exception was General Srilal 
Weerasooriya, who upheld professionalism 
and refrained from political involvement 
during his tenure.
While J.R. Jayewardene was the first to 
introduce direct political interference in the 
military, this influence reached unprecedented 
levels under the Rajapaksa brothers, 
particularly Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Under 
their leadership, the military became deeply 
politicized, fostering a culture where loyalty 
to political leaders often took precedence over 
national security priorities.
What Kind of Interference did the 
Rajapaksa Brothers Introduce in the 
Military?
As Secretary of Defense, Gotabaya strategically 
positioned individuals within the military who 
were loyal to him and his brothers, aligning 
key military leadership with their political 
objectives.
One of the most evident examples of this 
interference was Gotabaya’s favoritism toward 
the Gajaba Regiment, his former unit. Under 
his leadership, the regiment was elevated to 
a position of significant political influence. 
Promotions within the regiment—and for 
his political allies—were expedited, often 
bypassing traditional protocols and sidelining 
senior officers. This favoritism fostered a "my-
man" system, where certain individuals were 
privileged while others felt marginalized.
The strained relationship between then-retired</p>

Lt. Col. Gotabaya Rajapaksa and then-Lt. 
Gen. Sarath Fonseka, who was the Army 
Commander at the time, further deepened 
divisions within the military. Their dynamic 
was marked by clashing egos and competing 
priorities. Their disagreements became public, 
with Gotabaya actively working to undermine 
Gen. Fonseka. He promoted officers who were 
antagonistic toward Fonseka, bypassing both 
seniority and merit in favor of political loyalty 
and personal allegiance.
Competent officers deserving of promotion 
were overlooked in favor of those who 
aligned with Gotabaya’s personal agenda. 
The Rajapaksas’ approach institutionalized a 
culture where political loyalty took precedence 
over merit, fundamentally undermining the 
military’s independence and integrity.
Did the tensions between Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa and Sarath Fonseka arise 
while Fonseka was still the Army 
Commander?
This tension was separate from their later, 
more publicized fallout when Fonseka decided 
to contest the presidential election against 
Mahinda Rajapaksa. Their disagreements had 
already emerged during their overlapping roles 
in the military hierarchy.
The primary cause of their strained 
relationship appears to have been an ego clash. 
Ironically, Fonseka was a senior officer in the 
military while Gotabaya was still a junior 
officer. This prior dynamic influenced their 
working relationship later, when Gotabaya, as 
Defense Secretary, held greater authority over 
Fonseka.
Adding to the complexity was their regimental 
affiliation. Fonseka belonged to the Sinha 
Regiment, while Gotabaya was from the 
Gajaba Regiment. During Gotabaya’s tenure</p>

as Defense Secretary, his blatant favoritism 
toward the Gajaba Regiment—especially in 
prioritizing its officers for promotions and 
key positions—further deepened the divide 
between the two.
Do you believe Sarath Fonseka's 
arrest after his defeat in the 2010 
presidential election was an injustice?
The idea that we reap what we sow holds 
some truth, yet, setting aside philosophical 
perspectives, what happened to General Sarath 
Fonseka was undeniably a grave injustice.
According to military regulations, any 
allegations of treason should have been 
addressed through a formal court-martial 
proceeding, adhering to established 
protocols. However, in my view, the accused 
was not given a fair opportunity to defend 
himself. In Fonseka’s case, due process was 
blatantly disregarded. His arrest was abrupt 
and forceful, tarnishing the reputation of 
the military, while the subsequent legal 
proceedings lacked transparency, deviating 
from both military norms and the principles of 
natural justice.
It was later revealed that Gen. Fonseka was 
accused of acting against national interests, 
particularly concerning the White Flag 
incident. The Rajapaksas alleged that he 
attempted to disclose sensitive information 
that could have been detrimental to Sri Lanka.
However, at the time of the alleged incident, 
Fonseka was in China, raising serious doubts 
about whether he had been deliberately kept 
away as the conflict neared its conclusion—
leaving many questions unanswered.
Regardless of differing opinions on Fonseka’s 
conduct, the manner in which he was 
treated—stripped of his dignity and subjected</p>

to a highly questionable legal process—was 
deeply troubling.
Did the White Flag incident happen or 
not?
I cannot provide firsthand confirmation, as I 
was not present at the site during the events in 
question. However, based on widely discussed 
accounts within the military, it appears that 
the White Flag incident did take place.
From what I have heard, it is claimed that a 
deal was negotiated between Basil Rajapaksa 
and members of the LTTE’s second-tier 
leadership, with assurances that they would 
be allowed to surrender safely. However, it is 
alleged that Gotabaya Rajapaksa later reneged 
on this agreement and ordered their execution. 
Whether this decision was justified remains 
a highly contentious issue, with conflicting 
perspectives and narratives.
Another critical aspect often overlooked is 
the role of internal betrayals within the LTTE 
itself. I have heard that some members of 
Prabhakaran’s inner circle reportedly provided 
intelligence suggesting that allowing these 
individuals to survive posed a significant risk. 
This information is believed to have influenced 
the course of action that led to the White Flag 
incident.
During the final years of Prabhakaran’s 
leadership, several cracks began to emerge 
within the LTTE. A significant illustration of 
this was the killing of Tamilselvan, the LTTE’s 
political head. This incident is widely regarded 
as one that could not have occurred without 
insider information. The precision with which 
Tamilselvan’s exact location was targeted 
during a Sri Lankan Air Force strike appeared 
almost impossible without highly specific 
intelligence.
In your view, who is responsible for 
the victory against the LTTE? Was it 
Gotabaya, Fonseka, or someone else?
The downfall of the LTTE cannot be credited 
to any single individual—it was the result 
of a complex interplay between internal 
weaknesses within the LTTE and coordinated 
external efforts.
The LTTE leadership lacked the strategic 
foresight to sustain a prolonged war effort. 
Leading an armed struggle—especially one 
that claims to represent a minority—requires 
sustained international backing. Yet, the 
LTTE convinced itself that it could wage war 
in isolation, a miscalculation that ultimately 
proved fatal.
In its early years, the LTTE operated as a 
highly effective guerrilla force, making it 
nearly impossible for the Sri Lankan military 
to predict their attacks. But over time, they 
transformed into a conventional army, which 
demanded substantial external support in 
terms of logistics, strategy, and firepower. 
Their failure to secure this support turned into 
a major vulnerability.
Any armed movement that spans over two 
decades must evolve to remain effective. 
The LTTE’s inability to adapt left even its 
supporters questioning the viability of their 
struggle. A pivotal moment in their decline 
was the defection of Eastern Commander 
Karuna, one of their most formidable leaders. 
His departure didn't just weaken the LTTE 
militarily—it exposed deep internal divisions, 
further accelerating their downfall.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan military held 
overwhelming advantages—superior 
manpower, devastating firepower, fighter 
jets dominating the skies, naval patrol boats 
securing the seas, and a vast logistical network</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

sustaining its operations. Most critically, it had 
the backing of powerful foreign allies, further 
tipping the scales in its favor.
By late 2008, when Kilinochchi fell, the LTTE 
leadership should have realized they were 
fighting a losing battle. Their last remaining 
stronghold, Mullaitivu, left them with just 
two choices—either defend it or face total 
annihilation. Instead of launching a direct 
assault, the military strategically encircled and 
isolated them, cutting off external support and 
squeezing them into an inescapable trap before 
delivering the final blow. The LTTE leadership, 
however, failed to comprehend the gravity of 
the situation and made no meaningful attempt 
to alter their course.
In the early stages, the Sri Lankan government, 
with India’s alignment, leveraged U.S. 
counterterrorism strategies to dismantle the 
LTTE’s international operations.
One of the most decisive turning points was 
the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. That single 
act irreversibly turned India against the 
LTTE, stripping them of a crucial ally. The 
global landscape also shifted post-9/11, with 
international counterterrorism efforts leading 
to frozen LTTE assets and the systematic 
dismantling of their arms smuggling networks. 
Several of their arms shipments were 
intercepted and destroyed in international 
waters, crippling their ability to fight. Yet, even 
as they grew increasingly isolated, the LTTE 
leadership remained blind to the inevitable.
India, though not directly involved in the 
final phase, played a crucial role by providing 
intelligence and satellite imagery to the Sri 
Lankan military. International intelligence 
agencies, too, played their part in curbing 
LTTE funding and breaking their global 
networks.
Given these factors, the LTTE’s downfall was 
not the work of one man—it was a result of 
strategic military planning, international 
cooperation, and the LTTE’s own internal 
flaws.
General Fonseka, a battle-hardened 
infantryman, played a key role in deploying 
snipers and long-range fighting patrols that 
severely weakened the LTTE’s leadership. 
Gotabaya’s role, on the other hand, was largely 
in assisting his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, by 
coordinating military operations to align with 
political objectives.
But if anyone truly deserves credit, it is the 
thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airmen 
who fought and bled on the battlefield. Many 
disabled veterans have been reduced to mere 
political talking points, celebrated when 
convenient and forgotten when not. The same 
fate befell members of the LTTE and other 
militant groups. They were the real warriors of 
the conflict.
I have always believed that the true heroes are 
the unknown soldiers who perished in battle. 
Many of those who now call themselves ‘war 
heroes’ do so for political mileage rather than 
genuine valor. Except for a few rare exceptions, 
these so-called war heroes are, in reality, 
nothing more than war zeros.
Had the LTTE resorted to guerrilla 
warfare after losing Kilinochchi, do 
you think they would still exist today?
If the LTTE had released the civilians and 
retreated into the jungles after the fall of 
Kilinochchi, they would have scattered, 
making it far more difficult for the military 
to eliminate them entirely. Guerrilla warfare 
would have allowed them to regroup, launch 
sporadic attacks, and prolong their survival. 
By avoiding concentration in a single location, 
they could have posed a continuous, invisible</p>

threat, significantly complicating the military’s 
efforts to achieve a decisive victory.
However, the military’s key advantage during 
the final phase of the war was that the LTTE 
leadership and fighters were cornered into 
a small stretch of land. Crucially, there was 
no attempt by the LTTE leadership to revert 
to guerrilla warfare. Instead, they remained 
trapped, and their decision to stay in one place 
made them an easy target for the Sri Lankan 
military. Sporadic escape attempts were all 
thwarted.
Another critical factor was the physical and 
mental state of their second-tier leadership. 
Many of these commanders had joined the 
LTTE in their 20s and 30s when they were 
physically agile, resilient, and mentally sharp. 
However, by the final phase of the war, they 
were in their 50s or older, many with families. 
After decades of fighting, they either should 
have transitioned leadership to a younger 
generation or adapted their strategy. In their 
30s, they could endure the hardships of jungle 
warfare and engage in relentless guerrilla 
operations, but how many could sustain that 
same intensity and endurance in their 50s?
The LTTE leadership failed to implement a 
strategic transition, either in leadership or 
military tactics. They neither empowered 
younger leaders nor adjusted their approach 
to align with evolving global realities. Instead, 
they became predictable and vulnerable, 
ultimately sealing their fate.
From a military standpoint, the LTTE had 
lost its resilience in the final phase of the 
conflict, making it significantly easier for the 
Sri Lankan forces to eliminate them. Consider 
this: LTTE leaders and their fighters were</p>

confined to a narrow strip of land, completely 
surrounded by the military on all sides. They 
forcefully held civilians with them, using them 
as human shields. For the Sri Lankan military, 
the strategy became straightforward—rescue 
the civilians and eliminate the LTTE.
When you know exactly where your opponent 
is and can effectively confine them with no 
viable escape strategy, the outcome becomes 
inevitable. From a military perspective, what 
more could you ask for? It was a situation 
perfectly set for the LTTE’s total annihilation.
When were the strategies to annihilate 
the LTTE formulated?
The foundation for the LTTE’s ultimate 
military defeat was inadvertently laid by 
their own strategic miscalculation during 
the 2005 presidential election. By preventing 
Tamil voters in the North from casting their 
ballots—allegedly in exchange for financial 
incentives from the Rajapaksa camp—the 
LTTE effectively ensured Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 
victory. This decision, aimed at blocking 
Ranil Wickremesinghe from gaining power, 
ultimately backfired, triggering a series of 
events that culminated in the LTTE’s downfall 
in 2009.
The next phase of this strategy involved the 
return of Sri Lankan military expatriates 
with U.S. citizenship, including Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa, who played a pivotal role in leading 
military operations and providing strategic 
direction. This development signaled a tacit 
alignment between U.S. policy—particularly 
its efforts to freeze LTTE assets—and the Sri 
Lankan government’s military preparedness 
and resolve.
What was behind the strategy to 
eliminate the LTTE, and why was the 
U.S. so invested in this effort?
This was shaped by a confluence of geopolitical 
factors, particularly in the aftermath of the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. These 
attacks fundamentally reshaped global 
perspectives on terrorism, prompting the 
United States to adopt a more aggressive 
stance against armed insurgent movements 
worldwide.
The involvement of Sri Lankan expatriates 
holding U.S. citizenship, such as Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa—who returned to assume the 
pivotal role of Secretary of Defence—further 
strengthened military cooperation between 
Sri Lanka and the United States. This 
collaboration facilitated intelligence sharing 
and strategic coordination, bolstering Sri 
Lanka's military operations.
Additionally, India's intelligence agency, RAW, 
played a crucial role by providing satellite 
imagery and logistical guidance, significantly 
enhancing the effectiveness of Sri Lankan 
military campaigns.
Collectively, these efforts culminated in 
a coordinated international strategy that 
severely weakened the LTTE's operational 
capabilities, ultimately leading to its defeat.
So, you mean to say the early 
assignment of eliminating the LTTE 
was crafted by America?
Not by the U.S. alone—both the U.S. and 
India, which became strategic allies after the 
fall of the USSR, worked together. Based on 
the global geopolitical landscape at the time, 
it can be inferred that the CIA and RAW 
likely collaborated in assisting the Sri Lankan 
government in executing this plan.</p>

Is it true that the LTTE was paid to 
prevent people in the North and East 
from voting in the 2005 presidential 
election, which led to Mahinda 
Rajapaksa's victory?
Yes, in my view, this must be true. Reports 
suggest that the funds were sent to Vavuniya 
and collected by LTTE representatives. It is 
believed that the specific vehicles involved 
traveled via Puttalam, and the operation was 
allegedly known to the late Lt. Commander 
Sripathi Sooriyarachchi, who was then the MP 
for Chilaw.
Following his fallout with Mahinda Rajapaksa, 
Sripathi Sooriyarachchi publicly stated that 
he would reveal details of the transaction—
specifically, how the funds were transferred 
to the North. However, before he could do so, 
he died under suspicious circumstances in an 
accident.
Who collected the money on behalf of 
the LTTE?
The LTTE wouldn’t send senior commanders 
to receive the money. They would have 
delegated such tasks to mid-level operatives or 
trusted representatives.
Sripathi Sooriyarachchi died in a car 
accident. Was there any mystery 
surrounding his death?
As soon as Sripathi Sooriyarachchi began 
openly discussing the money allegedly given to 
the LTTE by the Rajapaksas, it became evident 
to many that his life was in danger. When 
news broke of his death in an accident, 
suspicions arose almost immediately—
for obvious reasons. However, his 
death remains shrouded in mystery, both 
in terms of its cause and the circumstances 
leading up to it.
At a recent press briefing in Jaffna, 
Namal Rajapaksa reportedly stated 
that his father, Mahinda Rajapaksa, 
was deeply affected by the killing 
of Prabhakaran’s 10-year-old son, 
Balachandran, after his capture by the 
army. A journalist who recently met 
Mahinda also noted that he remains 
troubled by this incident. Given 
these accounts, who do you believe 
was responsible for Balachandran’s 
killing, and what could have led to the 
decision to execute an unarmed child 
in custody? Additionally, considering 
that the 
military</p>

spared Rohana Wijeweera’s sons 
despite its brutal conflict with the JVP, 
how do you interpret this contrast?
Allow me to outline the rules governing 
the conduct of hostilities, which primarily 
aim to protect civilians. A principle I firmly 
believe it states: “You cannot give life to the 
dead, nor can you take life from the living.” 
Though I do not know the perpetrator or 
the coward behind this act, the killing of an 
unarmed person is absolutely unacceptable, 
and the murder of a child is an unforgivable 
atrocity. Such acts—whether committed by 
military personnel or militant groups—are 
reprehensible and dehumanizing.
Certain actions during armed conflicts can 
never be justified or excused.
Take, for example, the tragic death of 10-year-
old Balachandran (the son of Prabhakaran) 
or the horrific Aranthalawa Massacre, where 
most of the victims were young novice 
monks—children who cannot be seen as 
combatants in any form. On July 24, 1988, I 
personally witnessed the remains of an infant, 
the child of a then-DIG’s sister, after his 
ancestral home was burned down in Poddala, 
Galle. Similarly, the mass graves of murdered 
children from Embilipitiya Maha Vidyalaya in 
Sooriyakanda stand as a grim reminder of our 
disregard for humanity.
What do all these acts reveal? That our 
society has descended into a cycle of revenge, 
vengeance, and violence. During times of 
conflict, some perpetrators exploit the chaos 
to commit atrocities. If such acts are ignored 
or left unaddressed, society will inevitably face 
even worse consequences in the future. These 
actions are heinous and must be investigated—
otherwise, they risk becoming an acceptable 
norm for all wrongdoings.
To answer the second part of your question, 
one must consider the circumstances—
specifically, the location and intensity of the 
conflict, as well as where their families were 
residing at the time. From my understanding, 
in November 1989, Wijeweera was hunted 
down and arrested while living in disguise at a 
tea plantation. It was believed that Wijeweera's 
wife and six children were confined to a naval 
barracks. A similar course of action was 
taken for the Sea Tiger head Soosai’s wife, 
with her children detained at Trincomalee 
Dockyard and subsequently released. While 
Prabhakaran’s family was caught up and, 
following an assault, perished under battle 
conditions, contextually, these were two vastly 
different environments. However, one cannot 
comprehend or provide any explanation for 
the demise of Prabhakaran’s son.
What is your estimation of 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE?
One must acknowledge that Prabhakaran was 
a skilled fighter, and to a significant extent, 
the LTTE was a product of both the actions of 
successive Sri Lankan governments and India's 
geopolitical calculations. I can confidently 
say that Prabhakaran emerged as the most 
dominant leader among Tamil militant 
groups, but he made numerous strategic 
miscalculations. While I wouldn’t say that the 
formation of the LTTE itself was a mistake—
they may have had their reasons—the decision 
to eliminate other Tamil militant movements 
was a grave error.
I vividly remember seeing the bodies of TELO 
and other militant group members displayed 
near Windsor Theatre in Jaffna. When I 
saw that, I realized that these groups were 
heading in the wrong direction. Their actions 
convinced me that they could never succeed in 
their vision of a divided state.
Another significant issue within Tamil society</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

39
is the caste system—a deeply ingrained 
problem that no one wants to confront, even 
today. It is impossible to build a prosperous 
future while clinging to caste-based divisions 
and prejudices.
As for me, I am a proud Tamil. Had the LTTE 
taken a more pragmatic approach and pursued 
their cause more responsibly, they might have 
achieved something meaningful—similar to 
the JVP’s political evolution. However, their 
rigid decisions and violent strategies ultimately 
led to their downfall. Their miscalculations 
overshadowed their initial intentions, causing 
them to lose the very support of the people 
they claimed to represent.
How do you assess the LTTE as a 
fighting force? Were they valiant 
fighters?
They were highly skilled fighters, exceptionally 
trained and fiercely committed. The suicide 
bombers were prepared to sacrifice themselves 
without hesitation. The Sea Tigers, in 
particular, displayed remarkable dedication, 
excelling in naval warfare and introducing 
numerous innovative tactics at sea. The 
LTTE demonstrated extraordinary ingenuity, 
constructing submarines, assembling satellite 
stations, and developing improvised vehicles—
such as motorbikes running on kerosene—
while transforming ordinary materials into 
sophisticated weaponry.
However, while their innovations in warfare 
were undeniably impressive, my lingering 
question remains: why was such immense 
talent and capability not channeled into 
more constructive fields? The Jaffna Tamil 
community is inherently known for its 
resilience and industrious nature. I recall how 
farmers would climb onto a shadoof (Jyh) as 
early as 4 a.m. to draw water, toiling tirelessly 
until 10 a.m.—a testament to their unwavering 
dedication and perseverance.
The LTTE undeniably altered the perception 
of Sri Lankan Tamils, who were once seen as a 
passive and docile community. They instilled 
a spirit of resistance and defiance, proving 
that they could fight back against oppression. 
However, this transformation came at an 
immense cost, with little tangible gain.
Their sophistication in arms development and 
strategic operations was truly remarkable. Yet, 
the ultimate question remains: why did such 
extraordinarily talented individuals choose 
this path?
The LTTE’s fighters possessed the intelligence, 
creativity, and discipline to thrive in fields like 
technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation. 
Some of their brightest minds could have risen 
to global prominence—perhaps even reaching 
the heights of someone like Sundar Pichai, the 
CEO of Google. Instead, their potential was 
consumed by destruction and war—a path that 
proved to be a non-recoverable investment.
You identify yourself as a proud Tamil. 
We have even seen pictures of you 
wearing a Veshti and attending school 
functions while still serving in the 
army. Didn’t you feel conflicted, given 
that the army was often viewed as 
an oppressive force against Tamils, 
while the LTTE was seen as fighting 
for the Tamil cause? Didn’t you face a 
dilemma being part of that army?
You can ask anyone who lived in Puttalam or 
Vavuniya during my tenure in the army—did 
any injustice occur to the Tamils or any other 
community under my command? The answer 
will be no. I did not allow any harm to come</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

to them. If there is any Tamil who claims that 
the army harassed or mistreated them while I 
was in charge in Vavuniya, I challenge them to 
come forward. It simply did not happen under 
my command.
I never identified myself as someone from the 
South. Even within the army, I always upheld 
my identity as a proud Tamil and openly stated 
that I was from Jaffna. I made it a point to visit 
religious dignitaries and places of worship in 
Vavuniya, showing my respect and actively 
participating in religious ceremonies.
Until the very end, I have stood tall, firmly 
asserting my Tamil identity—"Be a Tamil, 
stand tall, and never bow down." That has 
always been my principle, guiding my actions 
throughout my service in the army.
Were there any challenges being a 
Tamil in a predominantly Sinhala-
majority army?
Absolutely. Such challenges are inevitable 
anywhere in the world. Instead of seeing them 
as obstacles, take them as opportunities to 
move forward. Wasting time tackling every 
issue of justice will only slow you down.
During my service in southern Sri Lanka 
during the JVP insurrection, I encountered 
many instances where innocent Sinhala youth 
were detained on suspicion. After thorough 
evaluations, I ensured the release of several 
young men who had no proven ties to the 
rebellion. Likewise, while serving in the North 
and East, I adopted the same approach—
working to release innocent Tamil youth who</p>
<p><img alt="p040_i1.jpg" src="assets/images/009_the_military_that_fought_the_war_should_have_been_/p040_i1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

41
had been wrongfully detained or held without 
sufficient evidence of any connection to the 
LTTE.
What stood out, however, was the difference 
in perception. When I secured the release of 
Sinhala youth in the South, it was regarded 
as routine justice and raised no concerns. But 
when I did the same for Tamil youth in the 
North, it often provoked suspicion and led 
some to question my motives. In fact, some 
even suspected me of having links to the 
LTTE.
Despite this, the soldiers under my command 
had unwavering trust in me. I had earned 
their respect, and they followed my orders 
without hesitation. My faith in God remained 
unshakable, and I carried out my duties with 
that faith as my guiding principle.
Being a Tamil in the army came with its own 
barriers—I was denied rightful promotions 
and other privileges. However, I never let that 
discourage me. Over time, God ensured that I 
received everything I deserved. I have always 
believed that if your principles and intentions 
are right, you will ultimately succeed.
Life, in many ways, is like a marathon—there 
will be slowdowns and moments of falling 
behind, but with resilience, persistence, and 
unwavering integrity, you will reach your goal 
and emerge victorious.
Before retiring from the army, 
we heard that you submitted a 
13-point reconciliation plan to the 
then Rajapaksa government. What 
happened to it?
I submitted a 13-point reconciliation and 
revival plan to then-President Mahinda 
Rajapaksa through the Army Commander at 
the time. I believed the plan outlined a genuine 
framework to address the root causes of the 
conflict and heal the wounds of those affected 
by the war. However, there was no serious 
effort to consider or implement it. Instead 
of prioritizing reconciliation, the leadership 
chose to exploit the post-war environment for 
political gain.
The JVP insurgency in the South ended in 
a manner similar to—but with less intensity 
than—the LTTE conflict. Yet, there were no 
victory celebrations or medals awarded upon 
its conclusion. Why? Because it is not ethical 
to celebrate the demise, misery, or pain of 
others. This should not be confused with 
honoring fallen comrades or commemorating 
those who sacrificed their lives. When the 
JVP insurgency was quelled, the military 
established a genuine inquiry to investigate 
the events and hold responsible individuals 
accountable. Why was a similar effort not 
undertaken following the end of the Northern 
conflict?
The military’s role is to protect and defend 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. In both 
cases—the JVP and LTTE insurgencies—the 
army was deployed to suppress an armed 
rebellion. However, what was lacking was 
a structured post-conflict rehabilitation 
process for those involved. Just as surrendered 
LTTE cadres underwent rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society, soldiers who fought 
in the war should have received similar 
psychological and social support. Their 
reintegration into civilian life was equally 
crucial but was largely ignored.
One of the long-term consequences of this 
failure can be seen in the "grease man" 
incidents—cases involving traumatized young 
men, many of them former soldiers, who 
engaged in erratic and criminal behavior due 
to unresolved psychological scars from the 
war. Even recent violent incidents in Mannar</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
42
highlight the lasting effects of neglecting post-
war trauma.
Had a proper commission of inquiry been 
established after the war, it could have 
identified excesses and irregularities within 
the military, held individuals accountable, and 
provided rehabilitation where necessary.
This would have enabled both soldiers and 
ex-combatants to reintegrate into society with 
dignity and ensured they had the resources to 
rebuild their lives. If such measures had been 
implemented, Sri Lankan society today would 
look very different.
However, for political reasons, the Rajapaksa 
brothers chose not to take these necessary 
steps. This decision left lasting scars—not just 
on individuals, but on society as a whole.
On what basis do you say that the 
army should have been rehabilitated?
Globally, it is well-documented that 5–10% 
of actively engaged combatants develop some 
form of mental strain or trauma, commonly 
referred to as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD). This condition has been medically 
proven and widely studied.
Even after the war, I witnessed firsthand how 
soldiers who had participated in intense 
combat would instinctively hide or take 
cover at the sound of firecrackers. I had 
young soldiers in my unit who reacted in this 
manner, displaying clear signs of trauma. 
Many army personnel who took part in the 
war suffered from PTSD and should have 
undergone proper rehabilitation through 
structured mental health programs.
Although some NGOs attempted to 
provide counseling, these initiatives were 
largely ineffective due to a lack of adequate 
government support. Unfortunately, proper 
rehabilitation was never prioritized, as the 
Rajapaksa administration was more focused 
on capitalizing on the war victory for political 
gain rather than addressing the mental health 
needs of its soldiers.
What were the key points in your 
13-point proposal?
Here are some of the most critical 
recommendations from my proposal:
Justice and Accountability
People, particularly within the Tamil 
community, seek justice and accountability 
for the atrocities committed by all sides. A 
fair, transparent, and balanced approach to 
justice is essential—one that addresses the 
full scope of human rights violations resolves 
cases of those missing in action, and facilitates 
the release of individuals held in prolonged 
custody, regardless of their political affiliations.
Victory Parade
The victory parade in 2009, following the 
defeat of the LTTE, was, in my view, highly 
unnecessary if the operation was genuinely a 
"humanitarian" mission. Such parades carried 
significant political and social undertones. 
After the war, where did we stand in terms of 
national identity as Sri Lankans?
The government used the event to assert its 
authority, framing the end of the conflict as a 
"victory." But victory over whom? The nation 
did not celebrate the conclusion of the JVP 
insurrection—why not?
Many, especially within the Tamil community, 
saw the parade as a symbol of their 
marginalization and a reminder of the heavy 
toll of the war on civilians, including concerns 
over human rights abuses and the treatment of</p>

ethnic minorities. I believe this event became 
an obstacle to reconciliation. While military 
parades are important for national pride, I 
question whether they should be held after an 
internal conflict that cost the lives of our own 
countrymen.
Common War Monuments
War monuments should honor all who were 
affected—armed forces, police, militants, 
and civilians alike. Only then can people 
truly reflect on the consequences of such a 
devastating conflict and its long-term impact.
Strategic Military Presence
The army should not be completely withdrawn 
after the conflict, but its presence should be 
strategically reduced. Instead of maintaining 
a heavy military presence solely in the North 
and East, military cantonments should be 
established in each province, ensuring a 
balanced national security approach.
Future of Ex-Soldiers and Ex-Combatants
The government should invest in the future 
of both skilled and unskilled ex-military 
personnel by providing career training 
and second-career opportunities. Given 
their discipline and training, they could be 
grouped for national projects, contributing 
to the country’s development. Such initiatives 
should extend to retiring officers and soldiers 
to uphold societal integrity and long-term 
stability.
Return of Occupied Land
All civilian lands seized by the military during 
the war should be returned to their rightful 
owners. The prolonged military occupation of 
private land fuels resentment and stands as an 
obstacle to true reconciliation.
Ethnic Representation in the Military
There must be adequate representation of Sri 
Lankan Tamils in the military. Only then will 
the Tamil community feel a sense of ownership 
over the armed forces and view them as a 
national institution rather than a symbol of 
ethnic dominance.
As a retired military officer with three decades 
of service who has lived through the conflict, 
I see the journey of healing and rebuilding as 
both a personal and national responsibility. 
In the post-war period, the military engaged 
in numerous projects in the North and East, 
winning the hearts and minds of the people. 
Unfortunately, politicians have often been 
reluctant to acknowledge and appreciate such 
efforts.
The government faces a monumental task in 
ensuring peace, stability, and inclusivity while 
addressing the socio-economic and emotional 
scars of the  past. A firm commitment to 
national unity and a long-term, sustainable 
reconciliation process will be key to Sri Lanka’s 
healing and future prosperity.</p>

Richard de Zoysa’s Murder 
and the Era of Fear: "Rani" 
Revisits Sri Lanka’s Past
T
he haunting epigraph, "A mother stops living when her children 
are dead," forms the bedrock of Asoka Handagama's Rani, a 
stylish biographical drama thriller. The film provides a gripping 
portrait of Dr. Manorani Saravanamuttu's relentless quest for justice 
in the wake of her son's murder – the acclaimed journalist Richard 
de Zoysa. Rani delves into a harrowing period of Sri Lankan history, 
resonating with a chilling contemporary relevance concerning 
political violence and impunity.
Nearly 35 years have passed since Richard de Zoysa's abduction and

murder on February 18, 1990. A journalist, 
author, human rights activist, and actor, de 
Zoysa's death sent shockwaves through Sri 
Lanka. Widely believed to be the work of a 
death squad linked to elements within the 
then-government of President Ranasinghe 
Premadasa, his killing was not an isolated 
incident. It occurred within a broader 
context of escalating human rights violations 
perpetrated by the government in its efforts 
to suppress the insurgency. While the precise 
motive remains officially classified, speculation 
persists that de Zoysa possessed incriminating 
information regarding these abuses. Janaka 
Mallimaratchi's memoir, "Rathu Anguru," 
recounts de Zoysa's growing distress in the 
weeks leading up to his death, his despair over 
the mounting youth casualties, and his fervent 
desire to halt the violence.
"Rani" opens with the grim discovery of 
Richard's body on Moratuwa beach. For Mano, 
a dedicated medical officer delivering babies, 
the loss of her only child is devastating. Her 
now-famous statement, "I was lucky that 
my son was brought back to me by the sea," 
poignantly echoes the anguish of countless 
families of the disappeared who were never 
afforded such closure. Flashbacks depict 
the harrowing abduction, the armed men 
storming her home, and the terrified silence of 
neighbors – a scene that powerfully captures 
the helplessness of ordinary citizens in the face 
of state-sponsored terror. The film then follows 
Mano's arduous journey as she navigates a 
system designed to protect the perpetrators, 
not the victims.
For those born after this period, like myself, 
the film is a crucial historical document. 
"Rani" has reignited conversations about 
political assassinations and the pervasive 
climate of fear that gripped Sri Lanka 
during this era. The film offers a visceral and 
immersive experience, drawing the viewer into 
Mano's world of grief, despair, and unwavering 
determination.
Swarna Mallawarachchi's masterful 
portrayal of Dr. Manorani is nothing short of 
breathtaking. She embodies the character's 
strength, vulnerability, and unwavering 
resolve, taking the audience on an emotional 
journey that spans the spectrum of human 
experience. Mallawarachchi's nuanced 
performance transcends mere acting; it is a 
powerful testament to a mother's love and a 
citizen's fight for justice.
Handagama skillfully weaves in recognizable 
figures from Sri Lankan politics – Lalith 
Athulathmudali, President Premadasa, 
Mangala Samaraweera, and a young Mahinda 
Rajapaksa – adding layers of historical 
intrigue. The meticulous attention to detail, 
from period newspapers and television 
programs to everyday objects like vintage 
cream soda bottles, creates a palpable sense of 
nostalgia and authenticity for those who lived 
through this era.

Anuththara shines as his friend, Gayan. The 
makeup artistry, particularly in bringing 
Ranasinghe Premadasa to life on screen, 
is commendable. The film also excels in 
its portrayal of the burgeoning friendship 
between Mano and a young mother whose 
baby she delivers, adding a human touch to the 
larger political narrative. Mayura Kanchana's 
portrayal of Karu, Dr. Mano's loyal helper, 
further enhances the film's authenticity.
Richard de Zoysa's work as the Colombo 
correspondent for IPS (Inter-Press Service), 
reporting on human rights abuses, 
undoubtedly posed a threat to the government. 
Rumors of his involvement in a satirical play 
critical of Premadasa, "Mei Kawuda, Mokada 
Karanne," (Who is he and what is he doing?) 
which was never staged, further underscore 
the risks he faced. The disappearance and 
presumed murder of the play's producer, 
Lakshman Perera, adds another layer of 
tragedy to the story. The film subtly alludes to 
this connection, perhaps through the character 
of Gayan.
De Zoysa's assassination is meticulously 
documented in "Under Siege; Mass Media 
in Sri Lanka," which details the abduction, 
the flawed investigation, and the allegations 
against high-ranking officials. The book also 
highlights the threats faced by Mano and 
her lawyer, as well as the attempts to link de 
Zoysa to the JVP. The fact that Richard's body 
was recovered, unlike so many other victims 
of enforced disappearances, underscores the 
significance of his case.
De Zoysa's legacy extends beyond his 
journalism. An award for independent 
journalism was established in his name by 
IPS. He is also the inspiration for Rajiva 
Wijesinha's novel, "Limits of Love," and 
features prominently in Shehan Karunatilaka's 
Booker Prize-winning novel, "The Seven 
Moons of Maali Almeida." His acting career, 
notably his role in Lester James Peries's 
"Yuganthaya," further cements his place in Sri 
Lankan cultural history.
While the film excels in many aspects, some 
casting choices fall short. Sanath Gunathilaka's 
portrayal of Lalith Athulathmudali, 
while technically proficient, feels more 
like an impersonation than a genuine 
characterization. Similarly, the portrayals 
of Mangala Samaraweera and Mahinda 
Rajapaksa lack depth and feel somewhat 
exaggerated.</p>

The film effectively depicts Mano's friendship 
with Athulathmudali and her grief at his 
assassination, highlighting the perilous 
political climate of the time. History suggests 
a complex and ultimately antagonistic 
relationship between Athulathmudali and 
Premadasa.
"Rani" powerfully evokes empathy for Mano 
and the countless mothers who have lost 
children to political violence. However, the 
film's ending feels rushed and emotionally 
underdeveloped. While it effectively portrays 
Richard's abduction and Mano's pursuit of 
justice, it fails to fully capture the depth of her 
sacrifices and struggles. The resolution feels 
abrupt and unsatisfying, leaving the audience 
with a sense of incompleteness.
The film portrays the assassination of 
President Ranasinghe Premadasa on May 
1, 1993, during the UNP's May Day rally 
in Colombo. He was killed along with 23 
others by an LTTE suicide bomber at the 
Armour Street-Grandpass Junction in 
Hulftsdorp. The attacker was later identified as 
Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar.
A particularly striking moment in the film 
is Manorani Saravanamuttu’s reaction to 
Premadasa’s death. Believing him to be the 
mastermind behind her son’s murder, she 
appears to find a sense of closure in his 
demise. This sentiment, however, was not 
hers alone. Several individuals have recounted 
similar emotions upon hearing the news. 
A friend’s mother, for instance, recalled 
that she was watering her plants when the 
announcement came—she instinctively felt a 
surge of relief and reacted without thinking.
While the loss of any life should not be a cause 
for celebration, Premadasa’s assassination 
was seen by some as the end of an era of 
state violence and extrajudicial killings. For 
many, it marked a turning point in Sri Lanka’s 
turbulent history—one that, for Manorani and 
others, brought a sense of justice, however 
complex and unsettling it may have been.
Despite a few shortcomings, I commend the 
production and Swarna Mallawarachchi's 
exceptional performance. This film, more than 
a biography, feels like a tribute to her acting 
prowess. It's a departure for Handagama, 
known for exploring controversial themes. 
While "Rani" is commendable, it could have 
been more impactful.
Ultimately, I'm glad I saw "Rani" in the theater. 
It was powerful and moving, and I recommend 
it to anyone interested in reliving the 1990s, 
paying tribute to Richard de Zoysa, expressing 
frustration with corrupt politics, or witnessing 
a remarkable performance.</p>
