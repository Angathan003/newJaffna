W
e met M.A. Sumanthiran at his 
Colombo residence. A prominent 
civil lawyer with an illustrious career in civil 
litigation, human rights, and constitutional 
law, Sumanthiran has represented the Jaffna 
District as a Member of Parliament since 2015. 
Prior to that, from 2010 to 2015, he served as 
a National List MP under the banner of the 
Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi. What follows 
are excerpts from a wide-ranging and hard-
hitting interview with him. Part 2 of this 
candid conversation will be featured in our 
next issue.
The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK) has faced internal divisions 
recently, with factions supporting 
different presidential candidates, 
leading to conflicting statements from 
its leaders. Who currently holds the 
official position within ITAK, and which 
faction's voice should the general 
public or ITAK supporters consider as 
the party's official stance?
The official stance of ITAK is determined by 
its Central Committee. Therefore, any decision 
made by this body should be considered 
the party's position, regardless of differing 
opinions among individual leaders.

What actions has the party taken 
against Ariyanethiran, a Central 
Committee member of ITAK, who was 
announced as the common Tamil 
candidate?
Ariyanethiran's actions were deemed to 
be in breach of the party's core principles. 
Consequently, the party has formally requested 
an explanation from him, marking the initial 
phase of the disciplinary process. Further 
actions will be determined based on his 
response and subsequent proceedings.
What will be the final step in this 
process?
The final step will involve a formal inquiry 
conducted by the party's disciplinary 
committee. Based on the findings of the 
investigation, appropriate measures will be 
implemented. Until the conclusion of the 
disciplinary proceedings, Ariyanethiran 
is barred from participating in any party 
meetings, including his role as Vice President 
of the District Committee and as a member of 
the Central Committee.
Will he be expelled from the party?
That remains to be seen, as it will depend on 
the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings 
and the findings of the committee.
In your view, who do you believe will 
win the upcoming election?
Based on my analysis of the current political 
landscape as of today, I foresee the contest 
narrowing to two formidable contenders: 
Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake (AKD). Both have amassed 
substantial support and represent pivotal 
segments of the electorate, positioning 
themselves as the key forces in this political 
race.
Setting aside the party's decision, 
which presidential candidate do you 
personally support?
Personally, I would prefer to support Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake. However, there is a 
challenge in this regard. His support among 
the Tamil population in the Northern and 
Eastern provinces is relatively low, with 
estimates suggesting it may not exceed 10%. 
In such a situation, I am uncertain whether 
supporting him would be a viable option.
In your opinion, whom will the majority 
of Tamil people support?
The majority of Tamil support is currently 
behind Ranil Wickremesinghe, followed by 
Sajith Premadasa. However, if true change is 
desired, I believe Anura Kumara Dissanayake 
could bring about at least a minimal shift. The 
 Among the three main presidential candidates, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe commands the most influence within the 
Tamil population, largely due to his long-standing political 
career free from ethnic nationalism and racial politics—a 
principle deeply valued by the Tamil community.</p>

other two have been part of the existing system 
for a long time, and I doubt they would be able 
to bring any significant reforms to governance. 
Whether Anura Kumara will win or not, I 
cannot say, but if elected, there could be a 
different approach to governance under his 
leadership.
But Anura Kumara Dissanayake has 
not said anything regarding Tamil 
rights, has he?
Actually, he has. When questioned about land 
and police powers, he stated that all powers 
currently provided in the constitution would 
be implemented as they are.
You mentioned that among the three 
leading presidential candidates, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe enjoys more support 
among the Tamil people. What is the 
reason for that?
Among the three main presidential candidates, 
Ranil Wickremesinghe holds the most 
influence within the Tamil population. 
A significant reason for this is his long-
standing political career, during which he has 
consistently avoided using ethnic nationalism 
or racism for political gain. This belief is 
strongly held within the Tamil community.
Is that true?
Yes. Ranil has never exploited ethnic divisions 
or resorted to racism for political advantage. 
Notably, in 2005, he openly supported a federal 
system during his presidential campaign. 
However, he lost that election primarily 
because voters in the Tamil-speaking North 
and East were prevented from voting by the 
LTTE. Had the Tamil population been able to 
vote, it is widely believed that he would have 
won. The Tamil community recognizes that 
his defeat was largely due to their inability to 
participate, and some of the older generation 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake offers the potential for at 
least a minimal shift.
Ranil and Sajith have long been 
part of the existing system, and 
I seriously doubt their ability to 
bring any meaningful reforms 
to governance.</p>

feel a sense of responsibility to correct this 
missed opportunity.
Additionally, during his tenure as Prime 
Minister under the "good governance" period, 
the Tamil people benefitted from various 
development projects, with substantial funding 
allocated to long-neglected areas. Ranil played 
a pivotal role in these initiatives, and as a 
result, he is a familiar and trusted figure among 
the Tamil population. In contrast, the other 
two candidates remain relatively unknown to 
the Tamil community, while Ranil's political 
track record is well recognized.
While the Tamil people predominantly voted 
for Sajith Premadasa in the last presidential 
election, it was Ranil who led the campaign 
efforts in the North and East. In fact, he 
played a key role in fielding candidates like 
Sarath Fonseka, Maithripala Sirisena, and 
Sajith Premadasa in the last three presidential 
elections—each of whom received significant 
Tamil support. Consequently, there is 
little opposition to Ranil among the Tamil 
community. While some politically astute 
individuals may express concerns about 
whether he will deliver on his promises, and 
there is some validity to those concerns, the 
majority of Tamil people still view Ranil as a 
familiar and approachable figure.
You have been a vocal critic of the 
common Tamil candidate. What do 
you foresee as the negative impact of 
having a common Tamil candidate?
Initially, there were concerns that the 
emergence of a common Tamil candidate 
could provoke a rise in Sinhala nationalism, 
but that hasn't happened. The Sinhala political 
parties have largely disregarded this candidacy, 
much like they did when Shivajilingam ran 
for president. Therefore, we don't see it as 
a significant issue at this stage. Currently, 
Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism is not a major 
factor, largely because the leading candidates—
Ranil Wickramasinghe, Sajith Premadasa, 
and Anurakumara Disaanayage—have 
refrained from fueling it. Although Namal 
Rajapaksa may have attempted to incite ethnic 
nationalism, he is not considered a serious 
contender.
Even within our own party, while we decided 
to oppose the common Tamil candidate, some 
members suggested leaving the decision to the 
people. I disagree with that approach. If we 
don't clearly state our position, people might 
assume we are undecided and may choose to 
support Ariyanethiran.
What is your estimation of how many 
votes the common Tamil candidate 
may receive?
In 2005, Ranil Wickremesinghe lost the presidential election 
primarily because Tamil-speaking voters in the North and 
East were prevented from voting by the LTTE. Had they been 
able to participate, it's widely believed Ranil would have 
won. Many within the Tamil community, especially the older 
generation, now feel a sense of responsibility to rectify this 
missed opportunity and support his leadership.</p>

I anticipate that he may receive between 25,000 
to 50,000 votes. If that happens, it won't have 
a major impact and will be viewed similarly to 
Shivajilingam's previous candidacy. However, 
if the vote count exceeds 100,000, it could give 
the impression that a segment of the Tamil 
community supported him yet failed to make 
any real impact in the election. This would 
reflect poorly on the Tamil community as a 
whole. That's why I urged my party to take a 
clear stance and avoid ambiguity. As the main 
political party representing the Tamil people, 
we have a responsibility to provide leadership 
and direction. If we fail to do so now, we risk 
losing our standing as their political leaders. 
It is essential that we remain committed to 
guiding our community with clarity and 
purpose.
A few political parties supporting the 
common Tamil candidate have signed 
an agreement with certain individuals. 
Is this appropriate? Can a political 
party make political agreements with 
individuals?
The presidential election is entirely a political 
process—there is no aspect of it that can be 
considered apolitical. Suggesting that political 
considerations should be excluded from such 
an event is fundamentally contradictory. If 
political parties begin signing agreements 
with individuals, it raises questions about their 
very purpose as political entities. How can a 
political party, which by nature must engage in 
politics, enter into agreements with individuals 
who advocate keeping politics out of the 
process?
If individuals or social groups wish to provide 
political direction or make decisions, they 
must first enter the political field and earn the 
During his tenure as Prime 
Minister under the "good 
governance" period, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe led key 
development projects that 
greatly benefitted long-
neglected Tamil areas, 
solidifying his reputation 
as a trusted and familiar 
leader within the Tamil 
community. In contrast, 
Sajith Premadasa and 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake 
remain relatively unknown, 
while Ranil's well-
established political track 
record continues to earn 
respect.</p>

support of the people. Only then will they have 
the authority to influence decision-making. 
Until that point, they can express their views, 
and as elected representatives, we are obligated 
to listen. However, the ultimate responsibility 
for decision-making lies with us, as the people 
have entrusted us with that authority. While 
individuals may offer opinions, they do not 
have the mandate to make decisions, and this 
distinction must be clear.
This is not a new issue. Attempts by individuals 
or civil society to influence political decision-
making have occurred before. During a period 
when Sampanthan was more active, civil 
society representatives would often approach 
him, urging for unity and the formation of a 
National Council. Writers and intellectuals 
would present lofty theories. For example, 
during a meeting in Mannar attended by 
Bishop Rayappu Joseph and Sampanthan, 
a similar situation arose. After hearing the 
day's arguments, Sampanthan respectfully 
responded, "Thank you for your important 
views. We will make a decision at the 
appropriate time."
One participant, a columnist and now a 
prominent supporter of the common Tamil 
candidate, stood up and demanded an 
immediate decision. To his disappointment, 
Sampanthan calmly replied, "The people have 
not given you the authority to make decisions. 
That authority rests with us. We will not shirk 
that responsibility. While we have listened to 
your suggestions, the final decision is ours to 
make."
Political parties and elected representatives 
must maintain this clarity—the responsibility 
of guiding the people and making decisions 
lies with us, not with civil society groups or 
individuals masquerading as social activists. 
Civil society does not hold the mandate to 
make political decisions.
Some suggest that recent actions, 
including the common Tamil candidate 
initiative, are part of a coordinated 
effort by those who have left the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA) to form a new 
political alliance. Do you agree with 
this assessment?
It is possible. They have been actively working 
on multiple fronts to achieve such an outcome. 
When the local government elections were 
announced, we, the Illankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK), proposed a strategy in which 
the parties within the TNA would contest 
separately, as we believed this would maximize 
the number of seats we could secure.
Those who are now backing the common 
Tamil candidate and were once part of the 
TNA immediately reacted by threatening 
to break away if we pursued this approach. 
However, we never asked anyone to leave. In 
fact, we believed that contesting separately 
could yield better results, but only if we 
remained united as a whole.
Their concern is that contesting separately 
would reveal the true extent of their support 
base, and this has caused apprehension. They 
are worried about exposing who genuinely 
has the people's backing. To counter this, 
they falsely accused us of attempting to break 
up the alliance. In reality, we only suggested 
contesting separately with their agreement.
Ranil has never exploited ethnic divisions or resorted to 
racism for political advantage.</p>

We have no issue with collaborating, but 
any decision must be based on a clear 
understanding of the actual support each 
party commands. ITAK is the only party with 
a comprehensive political structure. We have 
foundational, local, district, and constituency 
branches, ensuring full organizational 
coverage. No other party has this level of 
infrastructure. Moreover, ITAK operates under 
a fully democratic process. While the other 
groups may call themselves political parties, 
they originated from militant movements 
and transitioned into political entities, which 
is commendable. However, they still lack the 
internal democratic structure of a genuine 
political party.
Our goal has always been to unite, to build 
collective strength through solidarity. But 
for unity to be meaningful, each party must 
understand its role and place. When joining 
a prominent political force like ITAK, one 
cannot expect equal footing or shared 
leadership from the outset. A realistic grasp of 
political clout and organizational capability is 
essential for this alliance to flourish.
Do you think there is a chance for 
the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to 
reunite again?
Certainly, there is a possibility.
Is there a chance that you would 
welcome back those who criticized and 
left the TNA?
For the sake of broader unity, it is beneficial to 
come together, even if there are differences in 
opinion. However, they must not assume that 
we, ITAK, would compromise our uniqueness 
or alter the decisions we make for the benefit 
of the people.
Some within our party have raised questions, 
asking why we, too, should not support the 
common candidate since others are doing so. 
But true leadership lies in opposing what we 
believe to be harmful to the people, even if it 
goes against the majority opinion.
In this regard, I hold a great deal of respect 
for the Tamil National People's Front (TNPF). 
Whether their decisions are right or wrong, 
they stand firmly by their decisions, regardless 
of how many people oppose them.
Many of those who left the country at various 
points of time, especially during crises, hold 
certain fixed perceptions. We cannot blame 
them entirely for that—they remember the 
country as it was when they left, particularly 
those who went abroad after the 1983 violence. 
Their memories remain frozen in that period. 
But we have progressed significantly since 
then.
Those who still harbour resentment against 
the country, seeking to destabilize, bankrupt, 
or reignite chaos, must consider the impact 
their actions have on their own brothers and 
sisters who remain here. This is a matter that 
deserves serious reflection. While some abroad 
may cling to such views, those of us here 
must think critically and not be swayed by 
While the Tamil community predominantly supported 
Sajith Premadasa in the last presidential election, it was 
Ranil Wickremesinghe who led the campaign efforts in 
the North and East.</p>
