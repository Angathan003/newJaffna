Anton Master Speaks:
dialogue
Former Military Office Chief 
of LTTE Shares His Untold 
Story with 'Jaffna Monitor'
BY: 
Kaniyan Pungundran

LTTE's Annihilation of Rival Militants: A 
Condemnation of Injustice and Cruelty
While there were clashes between the LTTE and TELO in 
Jaffna, I was stationed in Chennai, overseeing MO works. 
According to the reports I received, TELO operatives had 
abducted a prominent member of the Liberation Tigers. 
This led to a rescue attempt by key LTTE figures, during 
which a former bodyguard of Prabhakaran, who was part of 
the LTTE, was fatally shot by TELO members. This incident 
sparked the conflict between the LTTE and TELO.
Part- 4
KT Sivakumar, also known as 
Anton Master, is a prominent 
early member of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and a close associate of leader 
Prabhakaran. He significantly 
contributed to the LTTE 
as a member of its Central 
Committee and as the founder 
and head of the Military Office 
(MO), enhancing the group's 
military effectiveness. Known 
for his reticence in media 
interactions, Sivakumar prefers 
'dialogues' over interviews. 
The following is a part of a 
series of dialogues I had with 
him, providing rare insights, 
which will be featured in the 
forthcoming issues.
Sri Sabaratnam</p>

I did not investigate this incident further, 
adhering to a non-interference policy in the 
operations of other LTTE sectors. Therefore, the 
specifics of Kittu's actions remained unknown to 
me. However, I was informed that under Kittu's 
command, the Tigers killed the TELO leader, 
Sri Sabaratnam, and many TELO fighters. Years 
later, I learned that Sri Sabaratnam was captured 
alive and was shot dead despite pleading for 
mercy. This act is morally reprehensible and 
constitutes a crime against humanity.
Similarly, after I left the LTTE in 1988 and 
moved to Canada, I heard reports that the LTTE 
had killed EPRLF leader Padmanabha and eight 
others in Chennai. This act is profoundly wrong 
and disgraceful.
Reflections on LTTE's Early 
Executions: The Case of Alfred 
Duraiappah and Beyond
Beginning in the early 1970s, especially during 
Alfred Duraiappah's tenure, Tamil youth in Sri 
Lanka increasingly embraced armed struggle as 
a perceived last resort for Tamil liberation. This 
shift, a response to feelings of oppression and 
marginalization where Tamils were perceived 
as second-class citizens, marked a significant 
turning point.
This transition to militancy, however, presented 
considerable challenges. Many Tamil youths, 
lacking experience and guidance, found it 
difficult to navigate the complexities of armed 
Funeral of Pathmanabha and 14 Other EPRLF Members, Following the Kodambakkam Attack on June 19, 1990.</p>

resistance while adhering to international 
humanitarian laws. Initially, this period did not 
feature an ideological framework associated 
with Velupillai Prabhakaran, nor was there 
a policy of executing individuals for non-
alignment with such ideology.
Over time, Prabhakaran's evolving leadership 
was characterized by strategic and tactical 
errors, contributing significantly to his downfall 
and the demise of the LTTE. These outcomes 
offer vital lessons for future generations about 
the complexities and challenges of conducting 
a freedom struggle.
In the post-World War II era, the international 
community, striving to prevent future conflicts, 
established the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and various treaties. These documents 
highlight the critical importance of protecting 
human rights through the rule of law to dissuade 
individuals from rebelling against tyranny and 
oppression. This historical and legal context 
emphasizes the imperative of adhering to human 
rights standards in any movement, including 
those aimed at freedom and self-determination. 
Unfortunately, Prabhakaran and the LTTE did 
not heed these principles, a factor that played a 
role in their ultimate failure.
LTTE's Early Internal Sanctions: The 
Michel and Parkunan Cases
You are inquiring about the internal killings 
sanctioned by the LTTE's central committee, 
Prabhakaran with then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MGR along with senior LTTE member Shankar. 
This photo was taken after a few months of Prabhakaran shaving his head to fulfill his vow after 
LTTE's first arms shipment arrived safely at LTTE's shores.</p>

before it transitioned to sole leadership. 
Notable examples include the cases of Michel 
and Parkunan, which received the central 
committee's approval. However, these 
acts were not motivated by malevolence. 
The involved young men had drafted a 
constitution for their movement, believing it 
to be the optimal approach for their struggle. 
This rigidity and strict adherence to their 
rules and regulations, however, adversely 
affected the LTTE and its relationships with 
other movements. Reflecting on this later, 
I realized the impracticality of running 
a freedom movement with such a rigid 
constitution, particularly one that mandates 
the execution of anyone who leaves the 
organization to start a new one.
Prabhakaran and God: A Glimpse 
into His Spiritual Devotion
Prabhakaran possessed a deep religious 
devotion, yet he rarely expressed it openly. 
He showed little interest in religious rituals 
or cultural celebrations.
When the Tigers were awaiting their first 
shipment of arms, Prabhakaran made 
a specific vow to a temple, though I am 
uncertain whether it was to the Palani 
Murugan or the Tirupati temple. Upon the 
safe arrival of the arms container in the 
hands of the LTTE, he shaved his head to 
fulfill this vow, subsequently wearing a cap 
for a period.
I met him during another significant 
event in 1987 when Prabhakaran's wife, 
Mathivathani, and their children were 
expected to travel by boat from India to 
Jaffna. He appeared noticeably anxious 
about their journey. In a gesture of deep 
faith, he again pledged an offering to a 
temple for their safe arrival, although I 
am unsure whether it was to the Palani 
Murugan or the Tirupati temple. I could 
not remember the specifics of the offering. 
I did not know how he fulfilled this vow for 
his family's safe travel.
Prabhakaran must have read the Bhagavad 
Gita, as he was fond of reading all kinds of 
books and wouldn't have missed it. However, 
I cannot assert whether the Bhagavad Gita 
inspired his killings. Regarding Hindu 
philosophy, first, there's 'I vs God,' then 
'Soul vs God (Dualism) ,' and finally 'I vs 
I,' symbolizing 'I am that oneness.' I'm the 
God, the soul, the body, and everything (I 
am That-monism). I think Prabhakaran 
contemplated this third stage, believing in 
the Hindu philosophical concept of 'I am 
the killer, and I am killed.' He was ready to 
die, just as he was ready to kill. But he did 
not wish to be killed easily and maintained 
intense security measures around him. In 
terms of devotion, karma, wisdom, and 
yoga, as described in Hindu philosophy, I 
have seen him exhibit devotion and karma.
However, he was not a religious fanatic. 
My house in Jaffna had pictures of Jesus, 
Buddha, and Gandhi in the living room. 
Later, I replaced Gandhi's picture with 
Swami Vivekananda's over time. Whenever 
Prabhakaran visited my room, he would 
look at the Buddha's picture and say 
nothing; even during our fight against 
Buddhist chauvinism, Buddha's picture was 
in my house, and he never objected to it. I 
believe Prabhakaran respected all religions 
and did not discriminate based on religion 
or caste.
