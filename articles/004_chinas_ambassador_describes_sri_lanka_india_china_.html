E
mulating Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic “I Have a 
Dream” speech, China’s Ambassador to Sri Lanka, 
Qi Zhenhong, outlined his vision for a collaborative 
initiative between Sri Lanka, India, and China, 
emphasizing that such a partnership is essential for 
regional progress. In a notable statement, he declared, 
“India is not an enemy nation to China. My dream is 
for Sri Lanka, India, and China to come together and 
advance a joint initiative in South Asia.”
He urged observers not to focus solely on the 
confrontation between China and India, emphasizing 
that both nations are major powers, neighboring 
countries, and ancient civilizations. At the same 
time, they are emerging markets with a 
shared mission—development.

"I believe that relations between China and 
India will continue to improve over time. 
As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
once said, China and India should strive 
for harmony by maintaining balance rather 
than seeking conflict. I have a dream that, in 
the future, China, India, and Sri Lanka will 
collaborate on a joint project or venture," he 
said during an interaction with select media 
representatives at the Chinese Embassy in 
Colombo.
The discussion, attended by media 
representatives, including Jaffna Monitor, 
covered key aspects of China’s policy 
approach. The ambassador elaborated on 
China’s Two Sessions—an annual political 
gathering comprising the National People's 
Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
These sessions set the country’s legislative and 
economic agenda for the year, shaping both 
domestic and foreign policies. The briefing 
also included insights into the Government 
Work Report, China’s economic prospects, and 
the country’s evolving diplomatic strategy.
China Reveals $7 Billion Loss in Sri 
Lanka’s Debt Restructuring
Speaking at the media briefing, Ambassador 
Qi revealed that China’s Export-Import Bank 
(Exim Bank) has incurred a $7 billion loss 
due to Sri Lanka’s foreign debt restructuring.

He noted that Although China is not a 
member of the Official Creditor Committee 
(OCC), China was the first country to sign 
a debt restructuring agreement with Sri 
Lanka, setting a precedent for other creditors. 
Expressing disappointment, he remarked, 
“Nobody in Sri Lanka talks about it, because 
we don’t do propaganda.”
The ambassador emphasized that China 
remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka’s 
economic stability. "Now, we look forward to 
seeing other official creditors finalize their 
agreements with Sri Lanka so that the country 
can recover and move toward financial 
stability as soon as possible," he stated.
China Responds to Tamil MP’s Remarks 
on Alleged Interference in Northern 
Waters
When asked about Tamil MP Selvam 
Adaikalanathan’s recent statement in 
Parliament—where he claimed " I ask, in what 
capacity is China engaging with our fishermen 
in the North today? China’s agenda has always 
been to seize land and exploit resources. We 
will not allow any form of intervention in the 
North through such means. No country other 
than India will be permitted to interfere in the 
North."—the Chinese Embassy in Colombo 
responded with a firm denial.
Deputy Chief of Mission  Zhu Yanwei who 
accompanied the Chinese ambassador in 
the press interaction, first asked whether the 
statement had been made by an Indian MP 
or a Sri Lankan Tamil MP, given its nature. 
Upon being informed that it was made by a 
Sri Lankan Tamil MP, he responded: "China 
has no strategic interest in Sri Lanka’s land or 
maritime territories. Our engagement with 
Sri Lanka is for the benefit of all its people, 
including those in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces. We do not differentiate between 
Tamils, Sinhalese, or Muslims. The Chinese 
Embassy here is committed to working with 
everyone in this country in all sectors—be it 
development, agriculture, or any other area. 
Our relationship with Sri Lanka dates back to 
prehistoric times, and China’s involvement is 
based on assisting its people, not geopolitical 
ambitions. Sri Lanka’s maritime boundaries 
belong solely to Sri Lanka, and China has no 
intention of creating conflicts between Sri 
Lanka and India."
He also emphasized that MP Adaikalanathan’s 
statement was a personal opinion and should 
be respected as freedom of speech.
When asked about the perception among 
Northern communities regarding China’s 
increasing presence in the region—particularly 
concerns raised in some Tamil newspapers 
that China might be "fishing in troubled 
waters" in relation to the Sri Lankan Tamil 
and Indian fishermen issue—Zhu Yanwei 
dismissed such claims.
"Sri Lanka’s land and waters belong to its 
people. Any disputes Sri Lanka has with its 
neighbors should be resolved independently 
by the governments involved, without 
interference from third parties.
China and India are each other’s largest 
neighbors, and we firmly believe they should 
be partners, supporting each other’s success. A 
cooperative pas de deux between the dragon 
and the elephant is the only viable path for 
China and India.
As for Sri Lanka, we trust in the country's 
wisdom and political acumen to manage its 
relations with its neighbors," he stated.</p>

China’s Stance on the Sri Lanka-India 
Fishermen Issue
When Jaffna Monitor asked whether China’s 
acknowledgment of Sri Lanka’s sovereignty 
over its maritime waters implied support 
for Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen in the Sri 
Lanka-India fisheries dispute, Zhu responded 
diplomatically, avoiding taking sides: "China 
stands with all its friends, including both 
India and Sri Lanka. We hope this issue 
can be resolved peacefully through mutual 
understanding and agreement between the 
two nations."
Continuing his discussion with the press, 
China’s Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Qi 
Zhenhong, described President Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake’s recent visit to China as highly 
productive, emphasizing that the relationship 
between the two nations has now entered a 
new phase, characterized as a “community 
with a shared future.”
"At the beginning of this year, the President 
of Sri Lanka undertook a highly successful 
state visit to China. Our bilateral relationship 
has now entered a new stage, defined as a 
'community with a shared future.' During this 
visit, 15 Memorandums of Understanding 
(MOUs) were signed," Ambassador Qi stated.
He underscored that such agreements would 
not have been possible without a strong 
foundation of mutual understanding between 
the two countries. "Both sides are now working 
closely to implement these agreements, 
delivering on the important consensus reached 
by our two leaders and bringing tangible 
benefits to our peoples," he added.</p>

China’s Support for Sri Lanka’s 
Development
Providing an example of ongoing cooperation, 
the ambassador stated that the Chinese 
government will donate school uniforms to Sri 
Lankan students in 2026. A Chinese delegation 
of experts will visit Sri Lanka to oversee the 
initiative, which will benefit a larger number 
of students than in previous years, including 
Buddhist monastic students.
Additionally, he revealed that China is set to 
donate and construct a National Exhibition 
Center in Colombo’s Port City, aimed at 
enhancing Sri Lanka’s global engagement.
The ambassador also highlighted the 
importance of personnel training and 
exchange programs, reinforcing long-term 
development cooperation between the two 
nations.
$3.7 Billion Sinopec Investment &amp; 
Hambantota Oil Refinery
Addressing China’s investment in Hambantota, 
the ambassador highlighted the development 
of South Asia’s largest oil refinery in the 
region—a project backed by Sinopec, a leading 
Chinese oil and gas company—with an 
investment of $3.7 billion.
The ambassador stated, "This initiative is 
expected to generate over 15,000 jobs for Sri 
Lankans and significantly contribute to the 
country’s economic recovery."
When asked about concerns regarding the 
potential impact on local water resources, 
he assured the media that China has taken 
environmental considerations seriously. "Water 
conservation measures are being implemented 
to mitigate long-term consequences," he 
stated.
He further emphasized that Sinopec’s 
investment will play a crucial role in helping 
Sri Lanka navigate its economic crisis, foster 
industrialization, increase government 
revenue, and enhance job creation.
Revival of Stalled Chinese Projects in Sri 
Lanka
The ambassador also addressed concerns 
over delayed Chinese-funded projects in Sri 
Lanka, stating that while some projects have 
been halted due to economic challenges, once 
debt restructuring is fully settled, China will 
reassess and proceed with previously delayed 
initiatives.
To ensure the success of these bilateral 
projects, he stressed the need for earnest and 
constructive discussions between Sri Lanka 
and China, aiming for win-win cooperation 
that benefits both nations.
China’s Position on U.S. and Russia
When asked about U.S.-Russia relations, 
he asserted that China and Russia maintain 
a non-aligned stance, striving to avoid 
geopolitical conflicts. He also reaffirmed that 
China’s historical ties with Russia remain 
strong and are unlikely to change. "A mature, 
resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship 
will not be swayed by any turn of events, nor 
will it be subjected to interference by any third 
party," he stated.
When asked about the deterioration of China-
U.S. relations following Donald Trump’s 
assumption of office as U.S. President, he 
emphasized, "China and the U.S. must seek 
peaceful coexistence on this planet."
He reiterated China’s commitment to 
maintaining stable bilateral relations with the 
U.S. However, he noted that China continues</p>

to face economic, technological, and military 
pressures from the U.S. Despite Washington’s 
aggressive tactics, he asserted that China 
is prepared to counter any challenge to its 
national interests.
"We are ready to go to any extent and fight the 
U.S. if China is treated unfairly," he warned.
Regarding U.S. tariffs, he stated, "China will 
definitely take countermeasures in response to 
arbitrary pressure.
China Denies Allegations of Interference 
in Jaffna University Appointment
Regarding the official letter allegedly issued by 
the Chinese Embassy, which was purportedly 
addressed to the President of Sri Lanka and 
the Education Minister in support of Professor 
Balasundarampillai's candidacy for the Vice 
Chancellor position at Jaffna University, 
Chinese officials have strongly denied its 
authenticity.
The letter, widely circulated on social media, 
contained a passage stating:
"In light of his vast experience, integrity, and 
unwavering commitment to the advancement 
of higher education in Sri Lanka, we believe 
that Emeritus Professor Balasundarampillai 
would be an ideal candidate for the position 
of Chancellor of the University of Jaffna. His 
appointment would not only bring immense 
prestige to the university but also inspire 
future generations of scholars in the region. 
The Embassy of the People's Republic of China 
respectfully requests Your Excellency to give 
favorable consideration to the appointment of 
Emeritus Professor P. Balasundarampillai as 
the Chancellor of the University of Jaffna."
The circulation of this letter has fueled claims 
that foreign countries are interfering in Sri 
Lanka’s internal affairs. However, when Jaffna 
Monitor inquired about the matter, Chinese 
officials vehemently dismissed the letter as an 
outright fake—so poorly written that it was 
evident the author had no understanding of 
how an embassy drafts official correspondence, 
an official stated to Jaffna Monitor.
"We have officially lodged a complaint with 
Sri Lanka’s Foreign Ministry regarding this 
matter," a Chinese official told Jaffna Monitor. 
"This is a sinister attempt to portray China 
as meddling in Sri Lanka’s internal affairs, 
particularly in Jaffna, in an effort to turn the 
people of Jaffna against us. We are aware 
that powerful individuals are behind this 
fabrication, but we will ensure that they do not 
succeed."
Monitoring India from Jaffna? ‘That’s a 
Bad Joke!’ Says China
After the press meet, in a casual conversation, 
Jaffna Monitor asked an influential Chinese 
diplomat about the speculation that China’s 
growing presence in the North was aimed at 
monitoring India.
Chuckling at the suggestion, he quipped, 
“That’s a bad joke! As you know, we are 
technologically advanced in every aspect. We 
have thousands of satellites-if we wanted to 
monitor India, we could do it while sitting 
comfortably in a room. We wouldn’t need 
to take a long trip to Jaffna just for that!”  he 
added, “Trust me, we’re here for development, 
not espionage.
What specific development projects China has 
planned for the North-and how they will take 
shape-remains to be seen.</p>
