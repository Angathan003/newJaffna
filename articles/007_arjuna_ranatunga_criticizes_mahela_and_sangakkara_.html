n a recent television interview, former Sri Lankan 
cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga raised severe 
concerns about the state of cricket in Sri Lanka, both 
in terms of player development and governance. He 
criticized former players Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela 
Jayawardene, and Tillakaratne Dilshan for not preparing 
the next generation, specifically Dinesh 
Chandimal and Lahiru Thirimanne, to fill 
their shoes after retirement. Ranatunga 
suggested that this lack of mentorship 
hindered a smooth transition and 
impacted the team's performance and 
stability.
Additionally, Ranatunga highlighted 
the pervasive corruption issue within 
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). He shared 
an unsettling experience where he 
was blatantly asked about the amount 
of money he could offer in exchange 
for votes, illustrating the extent of the 
corruption. This situation revealed that 
financial incentives were prioritized over 
genuine efforts to improve the sport. 
Ranatunga even claimed that the depth of 
corruption was so severe that someone as 
famous as Mahinda Rajapaksa would be 
unable to win an SLC election.
These comments from Ranatunga, a respected figure in 
Sri Lankan cricket, shed light on the challenges facing 
the sport in the country. The issues of poor succession 
planning and deep-rooted corruption suggest a need for 
significant reforms in the administration and management 
of cricket in Sri Lanka.

Criticizes Mahela 
and Sangakkara for

The Hunting Festival 
Translated from the

STORY
"True devotees..."
The crowd was momentarily stunned when the majestic 
voice boomed through the public address system. But the 
bustle was instantly restored as if the crowd wanted to 
declare that none among them are really true devotees. 
Children ran around boisterously engrossed in their games. 
Women were busy either “counting days in their monthly 
calendars'' to see if it would be appropriate for them to visit 
the temple on the day of the chariot festival, or gossiping 
and laughing about the sarees, jewelry, and the outlooks 
of other women. The white-vēṭṭi-and-wristwatch crowd 
of men who work in the city but had come back to the 
village on vacation, had taken refuge under the shadows 
of the peepul tree on the south side, and the portia tree</p>

east of it. They held forth knowingly, trying very hard to 
impress their audience, on the political situation in the city, 
the secret plans of ministers, and the shortcomings of the 
current government. Some others took these utterances 
as gospel and kept on vigorously nodding their heads in 
agreement. A few of the devout villagers were bustling 
about attending to various chores.
“Our omnipotent Lord is embarking on his hunt. He is 
sitting atop a beautiful horse for his procession. Behold 
that wonderful sight! Confide your concerns and sorrows in 
him and seek relief.”
The devotees got themselves ready to appeal to the 
deity about their myriad sundry concerns in the hope of 
obtaining relief.
Mounted on horseback, the deity made a grand entrance. 
They had decorated him with colorful flower garlands and 
clothing. A long staff had been thrust into one of his hands, 
a bow and arrow in another, and a third was holding the 
horse’s reins.
This deity has five hands; he is the Vigneswaran who 
removes all hindrances; Ganapathy, Vinayagan. Sometimes 
he is angry; sometimes he is happy and jolly; sometimes 
he is bored; sometimes he is into a beatific trance without 
caring about anything else. Right now, I thought I saw him 
with a subtle smile.
I must tell you a lot more about him and me. His temple is 
on the north side of the village. He had more possessions 
than a noteworthy rich man in the village. Now, he and I 
are like friends on nodding terms. He always had a certain 
haughtiness that one expects from a spoiled brat. He is 
older than me, many times over. My parents introduced 
him to me when I was a mere toddler. I had great respect 
for him then. To be totally honest, it was respect tinged 
with fear that he might choose to do me some harm. Later, 
I respected him because I wanted his friendship to fulfill 
my wants and needs. Sometimes when my wants were not 
met or when my hopes were dashed, I was incensed into 
trying to ignore him. Now our relationship has reached 
an amicable state. I have this urge to have an even closer 
relationship so that I feel obliged to visit him whenever 
there are special festivities at his home.
The hunting procession began.
Children chanted arōkarā loudly; Some held victory flags 
and proceeded with a skip and a jump; others walked with 
great composure, holding oil-fed torches aloft. A prayer 
troupe followed the deity. Muscular young men took turns 
carrying the deity, hoping to gain his grace. A colorful 
procession of women floated along slowly.
The deity had set off on the hunt with his entourage. I, too, 
joined the procession as part of his entourage. I walked 
witnessing the occasional diversions and amusements 
along the way. From time to time, I glanced at the holy 
face of the compassionate deity. I felt that the same smile 
was constant on his face.
The setting sun cast its rays through the gaps in the</p>

coconut trees that surrounded the field wells on the southwest 
side of the temple, and the green trees that enveloped the 
houses dotting the landscape. A gentle breeze wafted through, 
accompanied by the melodic waves of nādhaasvaram.
I let my heart, numbed from the sorrows of the mechanical 
city life, to delight itself in the lively beauty, motions, 
and naivete of the village life. My reverie was suddenly 
interrupted by the sight of that woman among the throng 
of women, her hands brought together above her head in 
veneration and devotion. The sight grated on me.
From my birth until I was a strapping youth of twenty, I lived 
among naive villagers as one of them. I played, learned, and 
dreamed the dreams of youth in that milieu. It is in this same 
milieu that I grew up, learning to be the rock that bears the 
joys and sorrows of life. I had encountered that woman in 
those times; I even remember talking to and laughing with 
her on a couple of occasions. 
Never on those occasions did her face stand out in any way. 
But now, that face with the buck teeth protruding through the 
small mouth grated on me.
She was wearing a simple handl oom saree. Although she 
was four or five years older than me, she looked like a young 
woman unfamiliar with the maturity or ravages of age. 
With her hands brought together above her head, she was 
immersed in her devotion, oblivious to her surroundings. A 
golden thāli glittered brightly on her neck.
How is she able to be unwavering in her peace? How is she 
able to worship God in that understated quiet manner? How 
is she able to immerse herself in her joy oblivious even to her 
own self? How is she able to become one with the essence of 
life?
The drum roared dum dum dum. They had placed a 
niraikudam at the entrance of a house along the way. The 
priest uttered the requisite religious incantations and waved 
a lamp in front of the deity. The rays of the evening sun 
reflected off the bronze niraikudam in a yellow glitter. 
Someone climbed on top of the wooden horse hoisted by 
the young men, and draped a red silk cloth over the deity. 
The crowd chanted arōkarā. She, too, stood with her hands 
clasped in worship.
I looked at the deity. All I could see was his mysterious smile.
The procession inched forward. Some people tried to squeeze 
the procession to one side of the road to make way for a car 
to go past. Someone removed the sālvai wrapped around 
their waist, flapped it vigorously and called out “arōkarā for 
a path, arōkarā for a path.” Someone else broke off a branch 
from the portia tree in a roadside fence and growled at the</p>

children, “make way you rascals!”
Somehow the big car managed to go past the procession. 
Inside a man and a woman were sitting at the front. The 
man was driving. The woman looked at the procession 
with interest and said something to the man.
As the car drove over the land parched by the summer 
heat, it left a trail of dust.
“What awful dust!” someone moaned.
“How can we have a hunt without dust?” responded 
another.
The crowd guffawed.
I looked at the merciful deity. He too was smiling. For 
someone setting out on a hunt, there was no bravery to be 
seen on his face. What a meaningful, sarcastic smile!
The hunting grounds were only a little distance away. Off 
the road, on a red-earth patch of land behind the temple on 
the eastern side, the field for the hunt had been set up. The 
ground had been swept clean and sprinkled with water to 
sanctify the area. In the middle, a fat virgin plantain tree 
was placed and suitably reinforced. The crowd of people 
formed a circle of about thirty yards in diameter, centered 
around the plantain tree. The deity stood among the people 
along with his closest retinue, like a tiger ready to pounce.
They circled the tree quickly at a rapid trot while carrying 
the deity; they strutted around thrice. The horse rocked 
back and forth with its forelegs in the air. The old priest 
held a sharp sword and stood at the ready near the tree. 
They ran back and forth while carrying the deity.</p>

On the third time, as the deity retreated and then advanced, 
the priest hoisted the sword and swung it across the 
plantain tree. With the same motion, he swung it again 
in the reverse direction. The first swing cut the tree into 
two, the reverse swing did no damage to the tree. The 
drumming reached a crescendo: dum, dum, dum. The 
nādhaasvaram played the ghaṉarāgam at length.The 
conch roared. The crowd chanted in devotional ecstasy.
Fragrant rosewater was sprinkled on to the deity. 
Vermillion was sprinkled on to the chopped off piece of the 
plantain tree and water was poured on it. An ālaththi was 
done for the deity using a five-pronged lamp with five oil-
lit flames. A piece of the “kill” was wrapped up in a piece 
of cloth and was tied to a foreleg of the wooden horse on 
which the deity was riding.
From whence did that face get this radiance…? 
That face…? That sad, frustrated, parched face that 
uncomfortably encountered him often on the way to 
school four or five years ago…? She smiled, crinkling her 
forehead with the vermillion poṭṭu, her thāli glittering a 
bright yellow against the blue backdrop of her clothes. She 
has still not forgotten me. Or has she tried not to forget 
me? Or is she incapable of forgetting me?
The hunt ended and the procession began again.
The points carrying lives moved about out of tune.
Where did this great silence descend…!
How did this bustle disappear …!
Is the silence that follows a great outpouring of emotion 
similar to this…!
The profound silence that succeeds great emotional 
upheavals. A complete silence; A silence replete with 
heartfelt poetic beauty…,
Is this what bliss is! Is this the meaning of life!
I regarded the deity. All-knowing, he smiled serenely.
That deity has five hands; He is the Vigneswaran who 
removes all hindrances; Ganapathy, Vinayagan.
