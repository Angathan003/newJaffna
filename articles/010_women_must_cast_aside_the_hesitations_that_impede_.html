"Women Must Cast Aside 
the Hesitations That 
Impede the Revelation of 
Their Talents"

role in preserving my identity throughout my 
journey. In this context, my maiden creation, 
"Iruttin Kaadhali" (The Lover of Darkness), 
has not only mirrored my life but also echoed 
the lives of my fellow companions. This 
poetry collection embodies the outpourings 
of a woman who, after basking in her father's 
love and care until age 38, endeavors to 
immortalize her experiences and lamentations 
following his loss.
I aspired for the release of this poetry 
collection to transcend a mere book launch. 
Hence, I unveiled some of the poems through 
visual displays and performance art. I chose 
a traditional house and meticulously crafted 
various visual setups for this. I desired visitors 
to immediately sense the essence of the book's 
title as they entered the abode. After moving 
through the displays, the book release was 
graciously conducted in the open, under the 
tranquil shade of a neem tree in the backyard. 
I now feel a profound contentment with the 
elegance and grace of the "Iruttin Kaadhali" 
launch. Additionally, the accolades and 
appreciation from many continue to pour in.
Are there any personal experiences 
or specific events that influenced the 
poems in this collection?
Joy and sorrow are universal to all human 
beings. Happiness, melancholy, despair, 
solitude, separation, and loss are emotions that 
have indelibly marked us all. We have traversed 
many a bitter experience and still relish many a 
sweet memory. In this light, the myriad blissful 
yet some bitter encounters I have faced in my 
life are the wellspring of my writings. I hold 
dialogues with my poems. Thus, today, I speak 
to the world through the medium of poetry. 
Like a steadfast companion, my poems journey 
with me, offering solace and clarity.
In the current landscape of Jaffna, 
we see a rare emergence of women 
writers. What do you think are the 
reasons behind this? What steps do we 
need to take to encourage and support 
more women to pursue writing as a 
society?
The right to sculpt our lives and the liberty 
to live them reside within us. The fervor to 
write and the zeal to cultivate it must first 
blossom within. Women must cast aside the 
hesitations that impede the revelation of 
their talents. Frequently, women fear scrutiny 
should they dare to pen their thoughts. Indeed, 
questions will arise. I first etched my poems on 
Facebook's canvas. Many who perused them 
would call, inquiring, "Is there some turmoil 
in the family?" All they sought was an update, 
nothing more. We must learn to traverse such 
inquiries with a smile. Our journey towards 
our aspirations should proceed with quiet 
determination. Women possess the swiftness 
and managerial prowess to juggle multiple 
tasks with finesse. The obstacles to nurturing 
these abilities must be viewed as challenges to 
be met with courage.
How has growing up in Jaffna 
influenced your writing?
Though my father, Asai Rasiah, was a 
celebrated painter, to me, he embodied the</p>

essence of a polymath. The poem he composed 
after beholding me for the first time in the 
hospital and those he penned after perusing 
my childhood photographs evoke a singular 
bliss when read.
One of his friends, the esteemed poet 
and medical doctor, 'Kaapiyakko' Jinnah 
Sherifdeen, once visited our home with his 
nephew, E. Samad, a traditional poet. E. 
Samad, in appreciation of our hospitality, 
composed traditional poetry. My father, in 
turn, crafted a poetic response.
In his book "Vimbam," he meticulously 
inscribed fitting poems beneath his paintings, 
all adhering to classical forms. Thus, my 
passion for poetry was kindled by my father.
How does your current interest in 
reading compare to when you were 
a kid or schoolgirl? Do you think the 
prevalence of high-tech gadgets and 
smartphones has affected the literary 
culture in Jaffna?
In my home, there exists a cherished 
personal library. It holds not only my father's 
professional tomes but also the works of 
literary giants like Sandilyan, Kalki, and 
Sujatha. During my school days, my father 
would gift me Rani Comics, Gokulam, and 
Panchatantra tales. I would eagerly devour the 
adventures of Mayavi in Rani Comics, my eyes 
wide with wonder. In contrast to the present 
era of sophisticated communication devices, I 
find that the times spent reading by the glow 
of an oil lamp and gathering to share stories 
under the moonlight were the true harbingers 
of joy and imagination, fostering a sense of 
well-being that modern times often lack.
Your father, Asai Rasaiya, is 
considered one of the best painters 
Jaffna has ever produced. How did his 
upbringing and teachings influence 
you, and what inspired you to pursue a 
passion for writing instead of painting? 
How did his philosophy and artistic 
influence shape your approach to 
writing?
My father never imposed his artistic profession 
or any other field upon me. However, due to 
being born into an artistic family, expressions 
related to these fields have been present within 
me since childhood. At the age of three, I was 
enrolled in Bharatanatyam classes. As I grew 
older, he would take me to evening classes 
for vocal music and violin under the tutelage 
of respective teachers. For my advanced 
studies, I chose Bharatanatyam as a subject. 
Subsequently, I went to India to pursue my 
degree in Bharatanatyam. It was only after 
my father's passing that I began to focus my 
attention on poetry. Thus, I did not have 
the opportunity to receive his guidance or 
influence in this realm.
