N
iththilan (name changed), a courageous 
United Nations worker, was one of 
the witnesses to the harrowing scenes of 
Sri Lanka's final war in 2009. He remains 
among the few living who can testify to the 
devastating atrocities committed by both the 
Sri Lankan government and the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
In September 2008, following a directive 
from the Sri Lankan government ordering the 
immediate evacuation of UN and international 
humanitarian organizations from LTTE-
controlled territories, Niththilan was appointed 
as the officer in charge of all UN operations in 
the LTTE-controlled territory. In this pivotal 
role, he led the UN mission within the LTTE-
controlled region, directing local staff in the 
absence of his international colleagues.
Currently residing in Europe, Niththilan has 
decided to break his silence and share his 
experiences with 'Jaffna Monitor' under the 
condition of anonymity.
How were you appointed as the official 
in charge of the UN following the Sri 
Lankan government's order for the 
immediate withdrawal of UN staff from 
LTTE-controlled areas?

The order for evacuation was issued on 
September 2, 2008, during the peak of the 
war. At that time, it seemed inevitable that 
Kilinochchi—the de facto capital of the 
LTTE—would soon fall into military hands.
I believe that the Sri Lankan government did 
not want any foreign observers present to 
witness the impending atrocities within the 
regions controlled by the Tigers. The claimed 
concern for the safety of United Nations 
organizations and their international staff was 
not the government's priority. Instead, their 
goal was to prevent external witnesses from 
observing the forthcoming human rights 
catastrophes—that is the truth. Hence, the 
government had to expel foreign observers 
from these areas.
The evacuation order was issued abruptly. Our 
important meetings typically took place at 
the UNICEF building, located across the lane 
from the Kandaswamy Temple in Kilinochchi. 
During one such meeting, we received a 
directive from Colombo stating that all United 
Nations and international non-governmental 
organizations (INGOs) were ordered to 
evacuate the areas controlled by the LTTE, 
except for the ICRC. The ICRC was granted 
an exception due to its unique contractual 
obligations with governments and because it 
does not publicly discuss its observations in 
war zones.
This notification came as a tremendous shock 
to us. We had planned to relocate all our 
operations to nearby Mallavi if Kilinochchi 
was captured, having already scouted locations 
for all United Nations organizations and 
international NGOs to continue their work. 
How did the people and the local staff 
of international organizations react 
when the international workers were 
ordered to leave?
The Sri Lankan government's evacuation 
order extended not only to international 
staff but also to all aid workers, including 
locals. All international organizations were 
instructed to close their offices and withdraw 
from Tiger-controlled areas. This directive left 
the entire staff profoundly disheartened. The 
international workers, who had become deeply 
attached to the local people, felt particularly 
distressed.
In my view, the United Nations and other 
humanitarian organizations should have 
used their global influence to challenge the 
government's directive. With over 350,000</p>

people living in these LTTE-controlled areas, 
these organizations should have taken a stand 
and declared that they would not abandon 
them.
Yet, no one—not even the United Nations—
made such a declaration. The absence of public 
advocacy from these organizations was deeply 
disappointing. If this was a blow to us, imagine 
the emotional turmoil of the local people.
How did the general public react to 
this...?
The disappointment among the people was 
palpable, sparking a spontaneous protest. 
Normally, in Tiger-controlled areas, the 
Tigers themselves orchestrated all protests 
and demonstrations. However, this time, 
I can confidently say that the protest was 
genuinely initiated by the people. They 
desperately pleaded with the international 
workers, begging them not to leave. The people 
physically blocked their way, refusing to let 
them depart.
In this emotionally charged situation, it 
became necessary to seek assistance from 
Nadesan, the political head of the LTTE. 
Following our appeal, the Tigers dispatched 
their clearance team to ensure the path was 
safe before any movements could proceed.
Was it not a problem for the LTTE that 
international workers were leaving?
Internally, the LTTE was not in favor of the 
departure of international workers. However, 
they also did not want to be tarnished with the 
reprehensible label of hindering UN workers. 
The Tigers have always sought international 
recognition and were cautious not to 
antagonize a major organization like the UN.
How many local UN workers remained 
inside the LTTE-held area after the 
evacuation of international workers?
More than a hundred local UN staff members 
and their families, originally from outside the 
Vanni region but working in LTTE-controlled 
areas, successfully secured travel passes from 
the LTTE and departed with the international 
staff. However, local staff native to the Vanni 
region were only granted travel passes for 
themselves, as the LTTE did not issue passes 
for their families.
Nevertheless, local workers who had close ties 
with the LTTE managed to secure passes for 
their families, and they, too, departed. After 
this, a total of 130 people, including 35 local 
workers and their family members, remained 
inside LTTE territory.

I spoke with the UN Resident Coordinator in 
Sri Lanka and conveyed that I, along with the 
few UN workers remaining in the LTTE-held 
area, did not want to abandon the people in 
distress. We wanted to continue working for 
them and to act as international witnesses to 
the atrocities occurring there.
At one point, the UN Resident Coordinator, 
Neil Buhne, agreed to this arrangement, and 
I was appointed as the officer in charge of the 
entire operation. All UN operations in the 
Tigers' area came under my supervision, and I 
was to report directly to Neil Buhne.
Were you provided with any 
guarantees for your safety by the LTTE 
or the Sri Lankan government?
We were given assurances by Nadesan, the 
political leader of the LTTE. He issued a 
letter to the local UN workers and their 
families, guaranteeing them exemption from 
compulsory conscription, and we encountered 
no issues in our movements from the Tigers' 
side.
Nadesan assured us that the same respect and 
honour given to withdrawing international 
workers would also be extended to the local 
workers. Furthermore, he guaranteed that the 
Liberation Tigers would not intrude into any 
UN premises.
Did the LTTE uphold its promise?
The answer would be both yes and no. As 
the military was nearing Kilinochchi, our 
UN storage facilities in the area contained 
essential supplies such as dry foods and other 
foodstuffs. Our stores also held thousands of 
litres of diesel and petrol, which were scarce in 
the LTTE-held area.
However, one day, an intelligence unit from 
the LTTE forcefully entered our office at the 
55th-mile post in Kilinochchi, intimidated 
the guards, and loaded all the stored diesel 
and petrol. Approximately 20-30 barrels were 
taken. We reported this incident to Nadesan, 
who acted promptly. He contacted the 
intelligence unit and demanded the return of 
the stolen items.
Although we did receive them back, about 
a third was missing, and the returned diesel 
and petrol were contaminated with water, 
rendering them unusable.
Did the LTTE confiscate food items and 
dry rations from the UN stores in the 
Vanni region during the conflict?
No, the LTTE did not take food items or 
dry rations from the UN stores in the Vanni 
region. Instead, they only requisitioned petrol 
and diesel, which were scarce resources at the 
time. During this period, essential food items 
like rice were abundantly available, with prices 
as low as 20 rupees. The Vanni region was 
largely self-sufficient and rich in rice fields, 
seafood, and vegetables. Although the local 
population lacked monetary wealth, there was 
no widespread hunger until the final months 
of the conflict. As the war intensified, the 
LTTE leadership relocated to the seashores of 
Mullaitivu, forcibly taking large numbers of 
civilians with them. This move dramatically 
altered the local dynamics, as people lost 
access to their agricultural lands, leading to 
increased hardship and poverty.
You mentioned that UN personnel and 
their families were exempted from the 
forced conscription by the LTTE. Could 
you elaborate on how the LTTE's forced</p>

recruitment of children was conducted 
during that period? Additionally, how 
did the local population react to these 
abductions, and what impact did 
these actions have on the relationship 
between the LTTE and the community?
In my opinion, in the eastern provinces under 
the control of Karuna Amman, then-chief of 
the Batticaloa and Ampara districts, the LTTE 
enforced a strict and ruthless conscription 
policy. This approach was fully endorsed by 
the LTTE's leadership in the North, who had 
observed its effectiveness in the East and had 
long contemplated implementing it in the 
North.
The LTTE launched an attack on the 
Muhamalai Forward Defence Line on August 
11, 2006, aiming to advance towards Jaffna. 
Reportedly, the LTTE achieved initial success 
on the first day. However, from the second day 
onward, recognizing the strategic importance 
of Jaffna, the Sri Lankan Army deployed 
significant forces in response, and the LTTE 
lost this offensive.
Following the LTTE's withdrawal from 
Muhamalai in 2006, the leadership reportedly 
decided to intensify their recruitment efforts.

Initially, the LTTE called for voluntary 
enlistment from families, requesting that at 
least one member per non-combatant family 
join. However, this appeal met with limited 
response, attracting only 25-30 youths.
Subsequently, the recruitment strategy shifted 
to compulsory, ruthless enlistment, mandating 
that one person from each family participate in 
the movement. This policy shift led to a surge 
in complaints to both the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 
the North-East Secretariat on Human Rights 
(NESOHR), an entity associated with the 
LTTE. 
Despite its ties, NESOHR, under the leadership 
of Father Karunaratnam (also known as Kili 
Father), received a vast number of grievances 
about forced conscriptions and abductions of 
children.
A close friend of mine who worked at 
NESOHR conveyed to me that they received 
around 6,000 complaints by September 2008. 
Post-September 2008, the situation concerning 
child abductions reportedly deteriorated, 
and the LTTE started abducting children and 
anyone who could bear arms. Before 2008, 
UNHCR and NESOHR received around 
6,000 complaints, but this does not imply that 
only 6,000 incidents occurred. From what I 
understand, there were many more incidents 
that went unreported. However, after 2008, the 
situation with forced enlistments spiralled out 
of control. The LTTE's ruthless child abduction 
units went on a rampage, abducting even small 
children as young as 14 years old. 
Why did the UN remain a mute 
spectator to these atrocities? Couldn't 
the UN take any action?
We were essentially mute spectators; 
realistically, we couldn't take any significant 
actions. We did not have any formal 
agreements with the LTTE, but they ensured 
our safety since we were operating within 
their regions. The UN typically worked with 
the LTTE, and while we were able to offer 
advice, we couldn't direct their actions. In this 
respect, the UN was indeed weak, a fact I must 
acknowledge.
UN officials discussed the issue of forced 
enlistments unofficially with LTTE leadership, 
including figures like Tamilselvan—the then 
Political leader of the LTTE while he was 
alive—as well as with Nadesan. Unfortunately, 
nothing changed. The LTTE claimed to be the 
de facto government, asserting that mandatory 
training and enlistment were standard 
practices in many countries. Our limited 
influence meant that we could only secure 
a commitment from them not to forcibly 
enlist UN workers and their families. I must 
shamefully admit that was the extent of our 
capabilities. Frankly, while ensuring our own 
safety, we could not stop the forced enlistments 
or abductions.
As the war intensified and LTTE territories 
diminished, they even abducted a few UN 
workers and their family members. In my 
opinion, the primary reason for the LTTE's 
defeat was their policy of forced enlistment. 
How can you abduct someone and expect 
them to fight loyally? This was a thoughtless 
and cruel decision by the LTTE leadership.
What are the atrocities committed 
by the LTTE in forced abductions and 
enlistments?
 I hesitate to recall these incidents, but there 
were many heart-wrenching stories that</p>

highlight the LTTE's ruthlessness. Let me 
share a few. I knew a girl, the top student in 
the biology stream at A-level in Kilinochi 
district, who was awaiting admission to Jaffna 
Medical College. She was the first in her family 
to potentially become a doctor. Tragically, she 
was forcibly abducted by the LTTE and died 
just a few months after the abduction. 
The LTTE abducted children from their beds 
and girls while they were taking baths. They 
abducted children after mercilessly beating 
their parents. When parents hid their children, 
the LTTE abducted the parents and tortured 
them until the children returned. To escape 
these ruthless abductions, many people 
married off their young daughters, some as 
young as 15 or 16, thinking that if they became 
pregnant, the LTTE would not abduct them. 
Hundreds of young girls, only 15,16 years old, 
got married and became pregnant. 
In the Mathalan area, the LTTE even abducted 
young girls who were two or three months 
pregnant and sent them to the front lines. 
What the LTTE did was a shameful act that 
every Tamil worldwide should be ashamed 
of. I do not know who initiated this forced 
enlistment strategy, but how could the LTTE 
leadership think that youths, abducted and 
sent to the frontline, would fight with ferocity?
Some suggest that this forceful 
enlistment may have occurred without 
the knowledge of the LTTE leader, 
Prabhakaran..?
The LTTE often publicly claimed to 
possess a formidable intelligence wing. It is 
laughable when people suggest that these 
atrocities occurred without the knowledge of 
Prabhakaran, which directly challenges the 
well-known centralized leadership structure of 
the LTTE. I am certain that nothing significant 
could happen in LTTE-controlled territories 
without Prabhakaran's knowledge. Given that 
we were operating within the LTTE's clear, 
single-window system, it is absurd to suggest 
that these atrocities took place without the 
awareness of the LTTE leadership.
Who has been actively involved in 
carrying out the leadership's orders to 
forcefully abduct children?
It was carried out by numerous individuals 
within the LTTE, with the political wing 
and the Tamil Eelam police at the forefront. 
Local area commanders were also deeply 
Brutal child abductors and war criminals of the LTTE: From left to right: Elilan, former Trincomalee Political Head of the LTTE; 
C. Ilamparithi, former Jaffna Political Head of the LTTE; and Kannathasan, former Head of the Tamil Eelam Music College</p>

involved. Among those who engaged in 
these brutal acts, as I witnessed, three figures 
stood out for their notorious involvement: 
Ezhilan, who headed the Trincomalee Political 
Department; Kannathasan, formerly the head 
of the Tamil Eelam Music College, who later 
transitioned to an academic role as a lecturer 
at Jaffna University; and Ilamparithi, former 
Jaffna political wing head of the LTTE. These 
individuals orchestrated a chilling campaign 
of child abduction, and I witnessed all three 
engaging in these brutal acts. However, it is 
important to note that these three were not the 
only ones involved in the child abductions.
How was Kannathasan involved in the 
brutal abductions you witnessed?
Kannathasan led a brutal abduction squad. 
I distinctly remember his name and actions 
from February 4, 2009, the day we, UN 
workers, were forced to move to the Mathalan 
area from Puthukkudiyiruppu. Prior to 
that, we were stationed directly in front of 
Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital.
It was Sri Lanka's Independence Day, 
and the government aimed to bring 
Puthukkudiyiruppu under control by that 
date. In their efforts, the government launched 
intense attacks on the area. On the night 
of February 3, the Sri Lankan government 
employed cluster bombs for the first time, with 
several shells striking Puthukkudiyiruppu 
Hospital. 
That same night, I immediately informed 
my UN reporting channel about the use of 
cluster bombs and attached a few photos of the 
unexploded ordnance. The UN quickly reacted 
and published a report condemning the use 
of cluster bombs, which are globally banned. 
However, the UN shamefully withdrew the 
statement on the same day following pressure 
from the Defense Ministry.
We, United Nations staff members and 
our families were given just two hours by 
the government to evacuate on February 
4. We relocated to the Mathalan area, and 
Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital also moved to an 
unfinished building in the new Mathalan area. 
Dr. Sathiyamoorthy, then the director of 
Kilinochchi Hospital and now the director of 
Jaffna Teaching Hospital, is a close friend. He 
contacted me, suggesting that proximity to 
the UN staff might shield the hospital from 
shelling. He requested that we establish our 
UN hub near the temporary hospital. 
In front of the temporary hospital was a rice 
field with a lone poovarasam tree (Indian 
tulip tree). Under this tree, we raised the UN 
flag and recorded the GPS coordinates at its 
four corners, sending them to our office in 
Vavuniya to officially mark it as a UN hub. Our 
hub was identified by two trucks and a flag.

For many months, terrible abductions 
occurred around us, but inside our UN 
hub, none of our staff or their children were 
abducted. However, Kannathasan led an 
abduction team that entered our UN hub in 
the Mathalan area and abducted four people, 
including two of our staff. 
I also witnessed him leading a brutal 
abduction squad and abducting children. 
Regrettably, I did not file a criminal case 
against him, a decision I still regret today.
Was Kannathasan carrying out the 
abductions because he was ordered to 
by the top command, or was he acting 
willingly?
Kannathasan conducted these abductions with 
great enthusiasm. From my observations, he 
seemed to enjoy directing a large team of child 
abductors and took pleasure in the act.
A member of the Tamil Eelam police, who 
was part of the team that came to abduct UN 
staff members, was a known person to me. 
He confessed that he was carrying out these 
terrible acts because he felt there was no 
other way and he was obeying orders from 
the top, but Kannathasan was different. He 
willingly engaged in these actions with evident 
enjoyment.
He abducted a young girl named Vijayabalan 
Manjula and sent her to the frontline, where 
she tragically died. Her mother filed a case 
against him, and the Vavuniya High Court 
sentenced him to life imprisonment—a 
sentence he truly deserved. However, our 
Tamil National Alliance parliamentarian, 
Sumanthiran, defended 
Kannathasan in the court of appeal, 
and he was later released.
Sumanthiran should be ashamed 
and deeply regret his actions. He 
failed to consider the agony of the 
mother who lost her child. 
I'm sure Kannathasan abducted 
about 500 children, with at least 300 
of them killed on the frontline.
