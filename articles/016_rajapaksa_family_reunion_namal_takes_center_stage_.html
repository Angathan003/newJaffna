Sri Lanka
I
n a striking display of familial unity, the Rajapaksa brothers 
are rallying behind Namal Rajapaksa, the 38-year-old 
presidential candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna 
(SLPP). Despite swirling rumours of a rift among the siblings—
complete with speculation that Basil and Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
were no longer on speaking terms—the senior Rajapaksas have 
banded together to throw their full weight behind Namal. This 
show of solidarity is not just a family affair; it's a calculated 
move to ensure that the Rajapaksa name continues to loom large 
in Sri Lankan politics.
Rajapaksa Family Reunion:
Namal Takes Center Stage 
in SLPP’s Survival Show

Namal, the youngest candidate in the 
upcoming election, is stepping into the 
spotlight with the backing of his politically 
seasoned uncles. It's as if the brothers have 
dusted off their old playbook, set aside any 
differences, and decided to run a full-court 
press for the next generation. The Rajapaksas 
are known for their deep-rooted influence and 
strategic moves, and with their "win-at-any-
cost" mentality, this latest manoeuvre is no 
different. After all, blood is bloody thicker than 
water.
Namal is receiving strong backing from his 
uncles—Gotabaya and Basil Rajapaksa—each 
of whom, an SLPP insider told Jaffna Monitor, 
will play a strategic role in the campaign. 
Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal's father and the 
most politically experienced and charismatic 
of the Rajapaksas, is expected to spearhead 
public meetings across the country. His 
considerable influence and popularity are 
anticipated to galvanize the SLPP's base and 
attract crowds in every constituency.
However, the insider noted that due to 
Mahinda's advancing age and health concerns, 
it's uncertain how many meetings he'll 
actually be able to attend. While his presence 
is undeniably powerful, the insider hinted 
that the former president might not have the 
stamina to make as many campaign stops as 
the party would hope. Despite this, Mahinda's 
involvement—whether in person or through 
his enduring legacy—remains a crucial 
element of the campaign, one that the SLPP is 
banking on to energize its supporters and sway 
undecided voters.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose presidency ended 
abruptly in disgrace amid widespread criticism 
and anger among the Sinhala people, will 
now shift his focus to leveraging his influence 
within the Buddhist clergy—where he still 
holds significant sway, an SLPP insider told 
Jaffna Monitor. His role in the campaign 
will be carefully managed, centring on visits 
to Buddhist viharas and engaging with the 
influential Buddhist monk community rather 
than making high-profile public appearances. 
This strategy aims to avoid reigniting the 
negative sentiments that still linger from 
his tenure while securing crucial votes from 
Sinhala-Buddhist hardliners.</p>

It's important to note that the Sinhala 
hardliners, who were also among those 
protesting against him and played a role in 
his ousting as president, don't take issue with 
Gotabaya's policies on Sinhala nationalism; 
their discontent stems from his economic 
missteps that plunged the country into 
turmoil. By keeping his public presence low-
key and focusing on his connections with 
the clergy, the campaign hopes to retain the 
support of this critical voter base without 
stirring up the economic grievances that led to 
his fall from grace.
An SLPP insider revealed that Basil 
Rajapaksa, the mastermind behind the SLPP's 
organizational structure, will be overseeing 
and coordinating the entire campaign from 
the party's Colombo headquarters. His role 
is pivotal, ensuring that every aspect of 
Namal's campaign is strategically executed 
with precision. Over the next five weeks, the 
campaign is set to ramp up significantly, with 
Namal participating in rallies across at least 
140 constituencies, making his presence felt 
in every corner of the country. The insider 
emphasized that Basil's meticulous planning 
and strategic oversight will be crucial in 
navigating the complexities of this high-stakes 
election. From the insider's point of view, Basil 
is the linchpin holding the campaign together, 
ensuring that every move is calculated and 
executed flawlessly as the SLPP gears up for an 
intense and widespread campaign effort.
The absence of former Speaker Chamal 
Rajapaksa from Namal's recent nomination 
event sparked speculation about a possible 
family feud. However, party insiders have 
clarified that Chamal's absence was due to ill 
health and dismissed any rumours of discord 
within the family. Both Chamal and his son, 
Shasheendra Rajapaksa, are expected to join 
the campaign trail as soon as health permits.</p>

An SLPP insider revealed to Jaffna Monitor 
that winning isn't exactly the main course 
on Namal Rajapaksa's election menu. The 
real dish being served here is the survival 
of the party itself. According to the source, 
supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe would be 
like serving the SLPP its last supper. Instead, 
Namal was served up as the presidential 
candidate, even if his chances of winning are a 
bit undercooked. But, the insider confidently 
added, "Namal will still be one of the top three 
most-voted candidates in the election.
It's not about this election," the source declared 
with the confidence of a weather forecaster 
predicting sunshine during a monsoon, "but 
about the elections to come. In a few years, 
we'll be back, and this time, we'll bring the 
whole buffet." Namal, they explained, has 
nothing to lose here—he's like a contestant on 
a cooking show who's just happy to be in the 
kitchen. By throwing his chef's hat into the 
ring now, he's setting himself up as the only 
contender for future presidential elections and 
the future face of the SLPP's political feast.
An SLPP insider elaborated, explaining that 
while prominent figures within the SLPP are 
flocking to Ranil Wickremesinghe like moths 
to a flame, this unexpected migration has 
actually rolled out the red carpet for Namal. 
It's as if the party's heavyweights are clearing 
the dance floor, giving Namal the perfect 
opportunity to waltz in and build his own base 
of loyal supporters—people who'll cheer him 
on even if he's slightly offbeat.
According to the source, no matter how this 
election plays out, Namal is in a win-win 
situation. He's not just solidifying his position; 
he's setting himself up as the future headliner, 
with influence that's only going to grow 
stronger. Think of it as Namal laying down 
the foundation for a house party where, by 
the next election, he'll be the undisputed host 
everyone wants an invitation from.
The source concluded by saying, "Namal has 
nothing to lose—whatever the outcome, it's 
only gains for him. In fact, he's already gained 
a lot."</p>
