Prabhakaran's Character and 
Leadership
At that time in 1977, I had not joined the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
Our meetings usually happen at public places 
like temples, bus stands, and libraries. When 
we met at the bus stand, Prabhakaran would 
arrive on a bicycle and take me with him, and 
we would chat while peddling. Prabhakaran 
and I became close to the extent that he would 
leave his gun at my house when he visited. He 
trusted me to that level.
Prabhakaran's Admiration for 
Historical Figures and Ideals of 
Martyrdom
Prabhakaran possessed a laudable quality: 
an eagerness to learn and a deep passion for 
reading. He was influenced by and considers 
Bhagat Singh, Veerapandiya Kattabomman, 
and Subhas Chandra Bose his role models. He 
had a particular admiration for Veerapandiya 
Kattabomman. However, I always viewed 
Kattabomman as unwise. I frequently debated 
this with Prabhakaran, arguing that true 
bravery would have been for Kattabomman to 
regroup his forces and continue the fight rather 
than face execution for defying the British 
tax demands. Prabhakaran, however, did not 
share this view. He passionately believed in 
the nobility of martyrdom and the honour 
of dying on the battlefield. He wished to be 
remembered as a heroic figure in Tamil history, 
akin to Veerapandiya Kattabomman.
In 1987, after the Indian army's arrival in Sri 
Lanka, Prabhakaran many times said to me,

"It's not wrong for a race to perish fighting for 
its freedom." This shocked me. I argued with 
him: Are we fighting to live or to annihilate 
our race and ourselves? His belief that a 
race can die for freedom persisted until the 
end. He lacked thoughts on sustaining the 
liberation struggle and ensuring survival. The 
Tamil literary books he read in his early years 
influenced his mindset. These books glorified 
dying in battle, which resonated with him. 
During the 70s and 80s, Prabhakaran, other 
LTTE members, and I regularly frequented the 
Regal or Rio theaters for the first and second 
screenings. We had a keen interest in films 
related to war, history, westerns, and law &amp; 
order. Hollywood movies often reached Sri 
Lanka late, premiering in Colombo before 
arriving in Jaffna. I watched the 1970 film 
'Patton' at Regal theaters well before meeting 
Prabhakaran. The film, portraying American 
General George S. Patton, includes his famous 
quote during a speech to the 6th Armored 
Division on May 31, 1944: 'No bastard ever 
won a war by dying for his country. He won it 
by making the other poor dumb bastard die for 
his country. 
Prabhakaran possessed many commendable 
qualities. He was dignified in his conduct, 
and I regard him as a true gentleman. I never 
heard him insult or harshly criticize anyone. 
However, he was stubborn, adhering to his 
own inflexible beliefs, akin to the saying, "My 
rabbit has three legs." He was not receptive to 
differing viewpoints. Over time, he developed 
the conviction that anyone not actively 
contributing to the LTTE was a betrayer. 
Initially a liberation fighter with a character 
of comradeship, he gradually believed in his 
totalitarian decisions. Prabhakaran's repeated 
errors in judgment and misguided decisions 
led to the unnecessary loss of many young 
lives and civilians. Thousands were maimed, 
suffering life-altering injuries, tragedies that 
could have been avoided. It's important to 
acknowledge that the Sinhalese population 
also endured loss of lives and considerable 
suffering.
As an individual, Prabhakaran had limited 
knowledge and a lack of foresight. In my 
opinion, he fell short in his role as a leader. 
True leadership carries immense responsibility, 
particularly when it involves thousands of 
young people who trust in and commit to 
the cause, often at the cost of their lives. 
Prabhakaran failed to fulfill this vital duty, 
which is my most significant criticism of him.
