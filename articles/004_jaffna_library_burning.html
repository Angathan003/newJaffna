Why South Asia Reveres Books-and 
Fears Their Destruction
Irrespective of religion, across the Indian 
subcontinent, books have long held an exalted 
status. In the indigenous spiritual traditions 
that emerged from this land-Hinduism, 
Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism-knowledge 
is not merely valued; it is venerated in the 
highest order. In homes, temples, and schools 
across the region, people treat books with 
profound reverence-never touching them with 
their feet, and if done accidentally, offering 
an immediate gesture of apology. Even the

accidental burning of paper is considered blasphemous by 
many, as it symbolizes disrespect to knowledge itself.
This deep cultural sanctity makes the destruction of books 
in South Asia exceptionally rare," a historian told Jaffna 
Monitor. "And when it does happen, it is both spiritually 
and emotionally devastating." He elaborated that such acts 
are believed to invite long-lasting karmic consequences, 
reverberating through cycles of collective consciousness. 
"That’s why," he said, "people are afraid-even those with 
power hesitate to commit such a sacrilege.
Nalanda to Nazi Germany: Fires That Still Burn in 
Humanity’s Conscience
Before 1981-before the burning of the Jaffna Public Library-
the last recorded destruction of a major library in the Indian 
subcontinent occurred nearly 800 years earlier, in the 12th 
century, when the Central Asian invader Bakhtiyar Khilji 
attacked Nalanda University in present-day Bihar.
Nalanda, a globally renowned Buddhist center of learning, 
housed an immense three-block library complex-so vast 
that one of its towers was said to rise nine stories high. 
It contained hundreds of 
thousands of handwritten 
manuscripts on science, 
medicine, logic, philosophy, 
and more, accumulated over 
centuries. When Khilji’s 
army set it ablaze, the fire 
reportedly burned for days. 
Even after centuries, the loss 
of Nalanda is remembered as a 
civilizational wound-one that 
the Buddhist world has never 
truly healed.
In global history, deliberate 
acts of violence against 
repositories of knowledge 
are rare-but when they occur, 
they carry chilling symbolic 
weight. The burning of the 
Great Library of Alexandria-
whether by Julius Caesar’s 
forces in 48 BCE or through 
later destruction attributed to 
Christian zealots or Muslim 
conquerors-marked the 
irreversible loss of a vast 
trove of ancient wisdom. The 
destruction of Baghdad’s 
House of Wisdom by Mongol 
invaders in 1258, during the 
sack of the Abbasid Caliphate, 
was another civilizational 
catastrophe; legend has it that 
the Tigris River ran black with 
the ink of drowned books.
Closer to our time, in 1930s 
Germany, the Nazi regime 
conducted public book 
burnings across cities-
targeting the works of Jewish 
intellectuals, Marxists, 
pacifists, and any writer or 
thinker the regime feared.

 Historians have long 
noted that these attacks on 
knowledge were condemned 
even more fiercely than 
the mass killings that 
accompanied them. The death 
of scholars and civilians was 
tragic, but the annihilation of 
accumulated learning-meant 
for generations yet unborn-
was viewed as a crime against 
humanity itself.
Where the Dhamma Was 
First Written-And Then 
Burned
Buddhism has always revered 
knowledge. The greatest 
man ever to walk this earth, 
Gautama Buddha, preached 
wisdom, rational thought, 
and non-violence. “Wisdom 
dispels the darkness of 
ignorance,” he said-one of 
many teachings that place 
paññā (wisdom) at the very 
heart of the Dhamma. The 
Buddha did not demand 
blind faith; instead, he urged 
inquiry, introspection, and 
understanding. “Do not accept 
anything by mere tradition… 
but after observation and 
analysis, when you find that 
it agrees with reason and is 
conducive to the good and 
benefit of one and all, then 
accept it and live up to it,” 
he told the Kalamas (Kalama 
Sutta).
For centuries, Buddhist 
monks were the guardians of 
Nazi youth brigades torching “un-German” books by Jewish and leftist authors 
at the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, 1933 — another deliberate attempt to erase 
ideas, identities, and inconvenient truths.

knowledge. Monasteries across South and 
Southeast Asia functioned not just as spiritual 
retreats, but also as de facto universities and 
libraries. Monks served as scribes, translators, 
preservers, and teachers of texts-from palm-
leaf manuscripts to meticulously copied 
parchments. 
Unlike many other religious traditions, 
Buddhism was not spread by conquest, but 
through teaching-rooted in logic, compassion, 
silence, discipline, and devotion. It was the 
quiet endurance of the written word-books 
and texts-and the spoken truth that carried the 
Dhamma across oceans and centuries. 
In fact, it was here in Sri Lanka, at Aluvihara 
in Matale during the 1st century BCE, that the 
oral teachings of the Buddha were committed 
to writing for the first time. This act-carried 
out by monks fearing the loss of the Tripiṭaka 
due to famine and war-resulted in the Pāli 
Canon: the world’s first complete written 
Buddhist scripture. It remains one of the 
greatest contributions Sri Lanka has made to 
global civilization. 
In Buddhist tradition, the act of burning 
a book transcends the mere destruction 
of parchment or palm leaf. It signifies the 
extinguishing of truth, insight, and the very 
path toward liberation. Such an act stands in 
direct opposition to everything the Buddha 
and his Dhamma represent.
The Buddha himself profoundly warned 
against ignorance as humanity's greatest 
enemy, stating: "There is no fire like passion, 
no shark like hatred, no snare like folly, no 
torrent like craving" (Dhammapada). In this 
context, the destruction of a library is not 
simply a worldly crime; it is a karmic betrayal 
of everything the Dhamma holds sacred.
It's a searing paradox in Sri Lanka's history: 
an ideology claiming to embody Sinhala-
Buddhism-a tradition supposedly grounded in 
compassion, wisdom, and enlightenment, and 
one whose collective memory still mourns the 
devastating loss of Nalanda University to a 
foreign invader-was twisted to commit, justify, 
or silently condone an act of unparalleled 
barbarism against knowledge on the island.
Eight centuries after Nalanda burned, in 1981, 
it was Sinhala-Buddhist mobs, backed by state 
power and emboldened by two bloodstained 
UNP Cabinet Ministers present in Jaffna, 
who, with the silent inaction or tacit approval 
of the Army Commander and Police Chief 
also in Jaffna that night, torched the city's 
most cherished symbol of learning: the Jaffna 
Public Library. Over 97,000 books, including 
irreplaceable ancient ola-leaf manuscripts, 
Tamil literary classics, and historical records, 
were reduced to ash. In that single night of 
unspeakable vandalism, they did more than 
burn books - they spat on the very soul of 
what the Buddha and his Dhamma stood for. 
A State-Sanctioned Crime
Sinhala nationalist forces and the Sri Lankan 
state often find themselves at a loss when it 
comes to the 1981 burning of the Jaffna Public 
Library-because, unlike many other atrocities, 
they can’t pin this heinous act on the LTTE, 
nor can they claim that the LTTE provoked it. 
At the time, there was no declared war, and 
the LTTE was merely an emerging group-a 
handful of young men scattered across a few 
hideouts, far from the formidable force it 
would later become.
“One observer told Jaffna Monitor that the 
presence of two Cabinet Ministers, along with 
the Army Commander and the Police Chief-all 
in Jaffna on the very night the library was set 
ablaze-was no coincidence, but a calculated 
show of state power. By orchestrating the</p>

destruction of one of Asia’s finest libraries, 
the then UNP-led government sent a chilling 
message to the Tamil people: ‘If you dare to 
raise your voice-if you demand dignity, rights, 
or recognition-we will silence you. We will 
go to any extent to erase your culture, your 
memory, your very identity.’” He further 
noted, “It was a calculated act of terror-
designed to intimidate an entire community 
into submission.”
More Than a Library: Jaffna’s Temple 
of Knowledge
The burned Jaffna Public Library had 
housed over 97,000 books and irreplaceable 
manuscripts-including the only known 
original copy of the Yalpana Vaipavamalai 
(The History of the Kingdom of Jaffna), 
miniature editions of the Ramayana, accounts 
by early explorers in Ceylon, and a trove of 
ancient palm-leaf manuscripts vital to Sri 
Lanka’s Tamil-speaking communities.
A Sinhala observer once wrote, after visiting 
Jaffna, that the Jaffna Public Library stood 
apart from every other library in the country: 
“It’s not just considered a library. It is treated 
like a temple of knowledge. I have visited 
many libraries across Sri Lanka and the 
world, but this is the only one where you are 
expected to remove your shoes or slippers 
before entering. You enter this library the 
same way you would enter a Buddhist vihāra 
or temple - with reverence.”
My father once told me, “For me, and for 
many young people of my generation, the 
most revered place in Jaffna wasn’t a temple 
- it was the Jaffna Public Library.” To him, it 
was a sanctuary, a sacred space where dreams 
were born and minds were shaped. He would 
often share stories of his youth - how, as a 
teenager, he cycled for miles from a remote 
village, braving sun and rain, just to spend 
precious hours inside that hallowed hall of 
knowledge. He spoke of the silence, the scent 
of old pages, and the feeling of stepping into 
a world far beyond the confines of oneself. He 
would sit there for hours, lost in books - until, 
like clockwork, the kindly librarian would 
walk up with a gentle smile and say, “Thambi, 
we’re closing now.” For him, those hours were 
not just about reading; they were about being 
part of something far greater than oneself.

 The story of the Jaffna Public Library began 
in 1933, when scholar and philanthropist K. 
M. Chellappah launched a modest initiative-
lending books from his home in Puttur. 
Joined by a group of like-minded community 
members, he formed a local committee and 
served as its secretary. What started as a 
single-room collection of roughly 1,000 books 
soon sparked a far more ambitious vision.
The dream of a permanent, purpose-built 
library quickly gathered momentum. 
Community leaders mobilized support, 
securing donations from local well-wishers 
and from the Tamil diaspora in Malaysia and 
Singapore. Their collective determination laid 
the foundation for what would soon become 
one of Jaffna’s most iconic landmarks.
Among the early champions was Dr. Isaac 
Thambiah, a lawyer and intellectual, who 
served as vice-chairman of the committee 
established in 1934 to formally found the 
Jaffna Public Library. His personal collection 
of books significantly enriched the growing 
repository.
Renowned Indian architect V. M. Narasimhan 
was commissioned to design the library in the 
graceful Indo-Saracenic style-a sophisticated 
fusion of Mughal, Hindu, and colonial 
architectural influences. Its soaring domes, 
sweeping colonnades, and pristine white 
façade bestowed a sense of timeless elegance 
upon the city. To ensure the library adhered 
to international standards, the eminent Indian 
librarian S. R. Ranganathan-widely regarded 
as the father of library science in India-
offered expert guidance on cataloguing and 
organizational systems.
 But the effort was not limited to India and 
Ceylon alone. Fr. Timothy Long, an Irish 
priest and rector of St. Patrick’s College from 
1936 to 1954, played a critical role in bringing 
the library to fruition. He traveled extensively, 
including to the United States, to raise much-
needed funds for the project.
Jaffna’s first mayor, Sam A. Sabapathy, was 
instrumental in translating vision into reality. 
He laid the foundation stone for the new 
library on March 29, 1954. Five years later, in 
1959, the first major wing of the Jaffna Public 
Library was officially inaugurated by then-
Mayor Alfred Duraiappah-marking the birth 
of what would grow into one of South Asia’s 
most revered centers of learning.
By the 1970s, it had grown into one of South 
Asia’s largest and best-equipped libraries. 
Its influence reached far beyond the Jaffna 
peninsula-Sinhala students, Indian scholars, 
and international academics all came to access 
its unmatched resources and pursue serious 
intellectual work.

Never Exclusive to Tamil Culture
Though it stood in the heart of a Tamil city 
and was deeply cherished by 
the Tamil people, the Jaffna 
Public Library was never 
exclusive to Tamil culture. 
Its vast collection reflected a 
spirit of intellectual openness-
housing not only Tamil literary 
treasures but also Sinhala 
texts, Buddhist scriptures, and 
works in English and other 
languages. It was, at its core, a 
monument to pluralism.
Elders who frequented the 
library told Jaffna Monitor 
that researchers from India and beyond would 
travel to Jaffna specifically to access its 
archives, often marvelling at the depth, rarity, 
and diversity of the materials it held. “This 
library was a cultural shrine,” one elderly man 
recalled. “It embodied the pride and dignity 
of the Tamil people, yes-but it also welcomed 
Sinhala texts and rare Buddhist manuscripts.”
He went on to explain that, just as Nalanda 
University had once been the epicentre of 
Buddhist learning in ancient India-drawing 
seekers from across Asia-the Jaffna Public 
Library had become a beacon for Tamil 
scholarship in modern Sri Lanka. Its very 
presence, he said, was an act of cultural self-
respect in a nation increasingly dominated by 
Sinhala majoritarianism.
And perhaps that, more than anything else, is 
why it was burned-to erase a living symbol of 
Tamil knowledge, heritage, and intellectual 
power. 
The Anatomy of a Cultural Crime
On the evening of May 31, 1981, tension hung 
heavy over Jaffna. “The town was already on 
edge,” recalled an elderly witness who spoke 
to Jaffna Monitor. That day, the Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF)-then 
the leading Tamil political party 
advocating for autonomy-was 
holding a major election rally in 
the heart of the town. 
In what many believed to 
be a deliberate provocation, 
the ruling United National 
Party (UNP) sent two senior 
Sinhalese cabinet ministers-
Cyril Mathew, a known Sinhala-
Buddhist hardliner, and Gamini 
Dissanayake, a powerful figure 
within the government-to “observe” the event. 
Their real motive, many felt, was to provoke 
and disrupt.
They arrived in Jaffna accompanied by 
hundreds of heavily armed Sinhalese 
police officers and paramilitary personnel. 
The atmosphere quickly turned volatile. 
Eyewitnesses reported confrontations between 
Tamil civilians and security forces-some of 
whom were intoxicated, hurling anti-Tamil 
slurs, and behaving aggressively.

minister of the UNP — a known

Amidst the rising tension, gunmen believed 
to be from the Tamil militant group PLOTE 
(People’s Liberation Organisation of Tamil 
Eelam) opened fire, killing two policemen. 
While the details of the shooting remain 
unclear, it became the spark-or rather, the 
pretext-for what appeared to be a pre-planned 
campaign of violence. The security forces and 
paramilitaries, already on standby, seized the 
moment as a green light to unleash chaos.
For the next 72 hours, Jaffna plunged into 
anarchy, witnessing a chilling display of 
systematic, state-sponsored destruction. 
Police and organized mobs, acting under 
the direction of political actors, unleashed 
coordinated attacks across the town. Dozens 
of Tamil-owned businesses, homes, political 
offices, and newspaper presses were either 
burned, looted, or both.
That night, scores of Sri Lankan police and 
government-sponsored paramilitaries fanned 
out across the city on a rampage It began 
with targeted reprisals: the downtown office 
of the TULF was stormed and set ablaze, as 
was the home of the local TULF Member of 
Parliament, V. Yogeswaranen. The attackers 
did not stop there. 
The Cultural Genocide
 On the second night of the pogrom-June 
1, 1981-Jaffna had already been scarred. 
Its homes smouldered, its streets were 
littered with the ashes of Tamil businesses 
and newspapers, and its people trembled in 
disbelief. But the arsonists, backed by political 
power, were not finished yet. There was 
one final target, one ultimate symbol left to 
destroy. Whether they had initially overlooked 
it, or whether a call from Colombo gave 
the final instruction, they turned toward the 
beating heart of Tamil intellectual and cultural 
pride-the Jaffna Public Library.
According to numerous eyewitnesses-
many of whom are still alive and spoke 
to Jaffna Monitor-the scene that unfolded 
was terrifying in its precision. After dusk, 
uniformed policemen and plainclothes men, 
carrying kerosene cans and sacks, began to 
gather around the library. Just past 10:30 
p.m., flames began to rise. Jaffna’s fortress of

knowledge, its temple of learning, was 
deliberately set ablaze. 
Attempts by then-Jaffna Municipal 
Commissioner C.V.K. Sivagnanam to dispatch 
fire trucks were thwarted, as armed forces 
encircling the Jaffna Public Library turned 
them away. By morning, all that remained of 
the iconic institution were scorched walls and 
the haunting scent of charred paper.
To ensure the building was completely 
destroyed, metal torches were used-alongside 
kerosene and, according to some accounts, 
chemical accelerants. The inferno raged 
unchecked throughout the night, with plumes 
of thick black smoke curling into the sky, 
visible for miles beyond Jaffna town.
 Residents stood helplessly on rooftops, 
balconies, and in gardens - eyes brimming 
with tears and anger - as they watched their 
cultural pride and intellectual soul reduced to 
ash. Among them was Rev. Fr. (Dr.) Hyacinth 
Singarayar David, who witnessed the blaze 
from his school balcony. Stricken by shock 
and grief, he went to bed that night and passed 
away in his sleep due to a massive heart 
attack.
Multiple eyewitnesses even recall seeing the 
ministers standing calmly on the veranda 
of the Jaffna Rest House, a government 
guesthouse just across the street, silently 
observing the inferno as it consumed the 
library.
An independent fact-finding mission from 
the Movement for Inter-Racial Justice and 
Equality (MIRJE) visited Jaffna shortly after 
the atrocity and issued a clear, unambiguous 
conclusion: “There is no doubt that the attacks 
and the arson were the work of some 100–175 
police personnel.” The perpetrators were not 
an uncontrollable mob-they were agents of the 
state.
Silence, Denial, and Mockery: The 
Aftermath of Jaffna’s Inferno
The next day, government ministers 
downplayed the attack, suggesting that a 
few policemen had acted irresponsibly and 
that the violence had escalated beyond their 
control. The narrative that the destruction was 
the unintended consequence of spontaneous 
disorder was repeatedly promoted by state 
media and echoed by government officials for 
years.
Most damning of all was the silence of 
President J. R. Jayewardene. He neither 
condemned the atrocity nor ordered any 
serious investigation. National newspapers 
gave the incident only minimal attention, 
treating the burning of one of South Asia’s 
greatest libraries as a minor news item.

Parliament raised anguished questions about

the incident, they were mocked and heckled 
by government benches. Several Sinhalese 
hardliners openly suggested that if Tamils felt 
aggrieved or discriminated against, they should 
leave Sri Lanka and go to India - a refrain that 
had become a frequent insult hurled at Tamils 
throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.
The burning of the Jaffna Public Library 
concluded with denial and impunity; no one 
was held accountable. This lack of justice, 
combined with the heinous crime of destroying 
a library, effectively terrorized an entire 
generation of Tamil youth. 
The Day They Burned the Buddha
The heinous act of burning the Jaffna Public 
Library transcended the mere destruction 
of books; it shattered the very soul of a 
civilization. In that inferno, memory was 
extinguished, wisdom suffocated, and truth 
brutally murdered. For countless horrified 
witnesses, it was tantamount to burning the 
Buddha himself.
In one of the most haunting literary responses 
to this cultural crime, renowned Tamil poet and 
scholar Prof. M. A. Nuhman captured the raw, 
unyielding agony and gravity of the act in his 
searing poem, Murder of Buddha, poignantly 
translated into English by S. Pathmanathan.
This is no mere lament for a lost building; it 
is a blistering, unforgiving indictment of a 
nation's conscience. It lays bare the profound 
betrayal of Buddhist values by the very hands 
that claimed to defend them, exposing the 
grotesque, soul-crushing irony of setting fire to 
sacred knowledge in the ruthless, consuming 
blaze of power.
We end with this poem - not merely as 
literature, but as testimony. It speaks with a 
moral clarity that no article can fully match.
Murder of Buddha
by Prof. M. A. Nuhman
(Translated by S. Pathmanathan)
Last night I dreamt 
Buddha was shot dead 
by the Police — 
guardians of the law. </p>
<p>His body, drenched in blood, 
lay upon the steps 
of the Jaffna Library. </p>
<p>Under cover of darkness, 
the ministers arrived. </p>
<p>“His name is not on our list. 
Why did you kill him?” 
they asked, anger rising. </p>
<p>“No, sir. 
There was no mistake. 
Without killing him, 
it was impossible to harm a fly — 
therefore…” 
they stammered. </p>
<p>“Alright then. 
Hide the corpse,” 
the ministers ordered, 
and departed. </p>
<p>The men in civvies dragged the body 
into the Library. 
They heaped the books — 
ninety thousand in all — 
and lit the pyre 
with the Sigalovada Sutta. </p>
<p>Thus, 
the remains of the Compassionate 
One 
were burned to ashes, 
along with the Dhammapada.</p>
