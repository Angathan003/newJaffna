I
f not for the bravery and persistence of 
Indian journalist Anita Prathap, the Sri 
Lankan state might well have succeeded in 
burying the truth about Black July 1983. At a 
time when the government was determined to 
deny that any pogrom had taken place—and 
when the state machinery worked overtime 
to suppress every whisper of anti-Tamil 
violence—it was Anita Prathap who broke the 
silence on the international stage. Defying the 
odds, she travelled to Sri Lanka and became 
one of the first foreign journalists to document 
and report on the brutal massacre of Tamils.
Her searing eyewitness accounts, along with 
the photographs she captured while stealthily 
risking her life with a Kodak Instamatic 
camera, directly challenged the state’s official 
narrative. Knowing that all journalistic 
material was being seized at the airport by 
Sri Lankan authorities, she smuggled the 
negatives out of the country with the help of 
a young couple and managed to get them to 
India. In doing so, she not only defied a state-
led media blackout but also forced both India 
and the wider world to confront the truth. Her 
reporting helped internationalize the horror 
of the 1983 violence and spotlight the long-
ignored plight of the Tamil people. Years later, 
in her acclaimed book Island of Blood, Anita 
reflected on that experience that changed 
everything: “Life for me has since been defined 
as before and after the 1983 riots.”
In 1984, she achieved the unthinkable—
persuading the elusive LTTE leader Velupillai 
Prabhakaran to sit down for his first-ever 
interview. Published in The Sunday magazine 
under the headline “If Jayewardene was a true 
Buddhist, I would not be carrying a gun,” the 
piece offered the world a rare glimpse into the 
mind and philosophy of the man who would 
go on to become the epicenter of the Tamil 
armed struggle. It was in this very interview 
that Prabhakaran delivered one of his most 
quoted declarations: “Nature is my friend. Life 
is my philosopher. History is my guide.”
She was a trailblazer in every sense of the 
word. At a time when women in Asia were 
rarely seen anywhere near riot zones, conflict 
areas, or frontlines, Anita Prathap walked 
straight into the fire—armed only with a pen, 
a camera, and an unshakable commitment to 
telling the truth. By doing so, she redefined 
what it meant to be a woman in journalism. 
Her courage was contagious. Today, every bold 
young female journalist from South Asia—
including India and Sri Lanka—chasing stories 
in the world’s most dangerous corners is 
undoubtedly walking a path she helped carve.
This is Jaffna Monitor’s exclusive interview 
with her.
You began your journalism career at a 
time when it was virtually unheard of 
for women in Asia to report on politics, 
riots, or war zones. You’ve mentioned 
that even your editors and male 
colleagues were initially taken aback 
by your determination to cover such 
stories. What was it like navigating 
the deeply male-dominated world of 
political and conflict journalism in 
those early years?
It was tough, but not that tough. What I 
have learnt is that persistence breaks down 
resistance. Most people do things one way 
because that’s the way things have been done. 
So their resistance is due to many factors – 
women have not reported war, women don’t 
cover politics, etc., etc. There were, instances 
of male chauvinism, but equally, there were 
supportive men. Most of them were old-
fashioned, not necessarily misogynistic. I don’t 
give up. I fail a lot, but because I don’t give up, 
I win eventually. Everybody remembers my 
victory; I remember all my failures.</p>

You come from a remarkable family 
rooted in Kerala’s ancient Catholic 
community—your grandfather was 
a pioneering educator and legislator, 
your father the first in your community 
to earn an MBA from the U.S., and 
your upbringing spanned seven 
schools across eleven years. How did 
this intellectually rich, reform-driven, 
and peripatetic childhood shape 
your worldview? In what ways did 
your parents and early experiences 
influence your adaptability, curiosity, 
and your decision to pursue journalism 
on the frontlines of global conflict?
My parents, grandparents, background, and 
childhood all shaped me to become who I am, 
but they did not make what I am- in terms 
of career. Yes, being in 7 schools in 11 years 
made me extremely adaptable, unafraid of 
new situations and new people. I am always 
excited to go to new places, meet new faces, 
taste new dishes, have new experiences, and 
try new gadgets. Newness opens up new 
frontiers, fresh ways of seeing, experiencing, 
understanding the world. How little we know! 
I see every day as a classroom of new ideas, 
thoughts, and experiences. Every night, when 
I go to bed, I think of all the new things I have 
learned during the day. I am learning more 
things now than I learnt when I was in my 
20s. Learning new things every single day. 
That’s what gives me joy and satisfaction. I am 
curious by nature. As they say, curiosity is not 
a destination, it's a compass in life.
Sri Lankan Tamils like me have a deep 
personal connection and enduring 
gratitude toward you for being one of 
the first to expose the 1983 anti-Tamil 
pogrom to the outside world. Without 
your courageous reporting, some say 
the full brutality of 'Black July' may 
have never reached global attention. 
You risked your own safety to stealthily 
photograph the carnage, and your 
eyewitness reports sparked an uproar 
in the Indian Parliament, ultimately 
playing a role in India’s decision to 
intervene in Sri Lanka. Looking back, 
how did that moment shape your 
career and the public’s understanding 
of the conflict? Did you foresee that 
your journalism would have such 
political consequences, and how did 
you cope with the emotional toll of 
documenting such horror firsthand?
It was the turning point of my career, I would 
say—even life, even though I was totally 
unaware of it at that time. Everything that 
happened afterwards was defined by this. 
It was war of a kind we, Indians, had not 
seen since the Partition, and South India did 
not really bear witness to that. I reported in 
detail—no adjectives, just describing what 
I saw. It was hugely difficult for me—the 
dangers, the unfolding of an atrocity, the 
horrifying images and emotions unseen and 
unheard of in my world until then. It shocked 
everyone, it stabbed everyone’s conscience. 
It’s one thing covering a situation like this 
through press briefings and interviews with 
analysts, etc., totally different when you report 
it from hell as it unfolds. No one had covered a 
story of this tragic proportion in this manner. 
Perhaps even more significantly, no woman 
had reported from ground zero. It captured 
people’s imagination, it stirred the Tamil</p>

media, and then suddenly I became part of 
the story. It shattered myths about women, 
broke glass ceilings. It was impactful in every 
way. Even today, no matter all the stories I 
have done—reporting from Siachen glacier or 
Taliban capture of Kabul—it is the Sri Lanka 
ethnic crisis, the interviews with Prabhakaran 
that is associated with me, most of all.
As you mentioned, it is the interviews 
with Prabhakaran that remain most 
closely associated with you. At the 
time, nearly three dozen Sri Lankan 
Tamil militant groups were active, 
each fighting for Tamil Eelam on their 
own terms. Why did you identify the 
LTTE and its leader, Prabhakaran, as 
the frontrunner? Was there something 
distinctive about their strategy, 
leadership, or organizational structure 
that drew your attention?
Yes, absolutely. As they say, a person is known 
by the company he/she keeps. A guerrilla 
organisation is known not just by the leader, 
but by its cadre. The LTTE cadre was superior 
in every way — they were committed, hard-
working, simple, unassuming, and spoke little. 
They were dedicated in a powerful way. The 
other groups had normal cadres; they were like 
us, ordinary people. When I saw how different 
the LTTE members were, I realised the leader 
must be of a different calibre if he raised this 
cadre. I met all the other leaders, but it was 
impossible to meet Prabhakaran. I was told

— he is fighting a war, he has no time for 
interviews. I liked the fact that he was not into 
self-promotion, and so I redoubled and tripled 
my efforts to meet him.
With your redoubled and tripled 
efforts, you became the first journalist 
ever to interview the elusive 
Prabhakaran. Could you take us 
through how you managed to secure 
that interview? What convinced him to 
speak with you, and why do you think 
he placed his trust in you? How did 
that historic encounter unfold—and 
as someone who met Prabhakaran in 
person, how did he strike you?
He finally agreed to meet me after the July 
riots. His reason was that the LTTE were 
guerrillas, so they had to go into the war 
zones. But I didn’t have to, I was only a 
journalist. But that I chose to risk 
my life for the story impressed him, 
about my so-called courage and 
dedication. He said he was grateful 
that I had “internationalised” the 
Tamil conflict and brought attention 
to it, that I did so by highlighting 
Tamil suffering. He wanted to 
meet me to personally express his 
gratitude. After my articles, there 
was no longer he-said-she-said type 
of reporting. The onslaught against 
Tamils was evident. JR told me a 
few years later that G. Parthasarathy, 
India’s envoy to Sri Lanka, quoted 
incidents from my report during 
their meeting to highlight that India 
cannot remain silent against such 
atrocities. The Indian side told me JR 
started the meeting denying any anti-
Tamil pogrom, but kept quiet after a 
while when these specific incidents 
were pointed out.
When I first met him, my impression of 
Prabhakaran was that he was unimpressive. 
By the end of the interview, I felt he lived up 
to the impression I had of him before I met 
him – his commitment shone through like 
headlamps in a dark forest.
The LTTE has often been described 
as a highly disciplined and tightly 
organized movement. Based on your 
firsthand observations, what aspects 
of its internal structure, command 
hierarchy, or operational discipline 
left a lasting impression on you—or 
perhaps even evoked a sense of awe?
I was always impressed by their dedication. I 
have never seen anything like it. We can’t get 
a carpenter to fix a table properly—here was 
Prabhakaran raising a cadre willing to sacrifice 
Prabhakaran’s first-ever interview, given to Anita Prathap in 1984 for 
Sunday magazine.</p>

their lives for him and for the cause. There was 
no flash or boastfulness, no body language that 
suggested they were on a grand mission. Their 
simplicity was striking. They were soft-spoken 
and neatly dressed, but in simple clothes and 
chappals. They never carried a gun. Their 
unwavering devotion to Prabhakaran was 
the secret glue that kept the LTTE so tightly 
knit. It was also the most security-conscious, 
secretive group I have ever encountered.
In your conversations with 
Prabhakaran, was there anything he 
shared off the record-or conveyed 
between the lines-that the world never 
got to see or hear? Now that it's been 
over 16 years since his death, would 
you feel comfortable sharing any of 
those insights, if they are still relevant 
or revealing?
No, when I met him, I told him upfront that 
whatever he said would be reported. I taped 
our entire conversation. He knows better than 
to share a secret with a journalist. He never 
spoke ill of anyone. I remember J. N. Dixit and 
Ranjan Wijeratne would say terrible things 
about Prabhakaran.
Ranjan Wijeratne would tell me – ‘Next time 
you come to Colombo, Prabhakaran will be 
a dead man.’ Next time I came, Wijeratne 
was dead, killed by an LTTE suicide bomber. 
Prabhakaran never made threats. He just 
executed them. I knew Gamini Dissanayake 
well. He was an amazing raconteur. He would 
regale me with Colombo 7 gossip. Once I told 
him Prabhakaran likes Chinese food, because 
invariably after our interviews, Chinese fried 
rice, etc., would be served. Even in wanni 
jungle! On my next trip to Colombo, every 
single person I met—from the President to 
people on the street—knew that Prabhakaran 
liked Chinese food. Of course, I had 
mentioned this in my story months earlier, 
but there was hardly a ripple. In Colombo, 
nothing could match the Gamini Broadcasting 
Corporation.
You once described Prabhakaran as 
the man you met with the greatest 
Anita Prathap with Indian Army officers in Siachen</p>

sense of foresight. 
In hindsight, do 
you still stand by 
that assessment—
especially considering 
the decisions he 
made during the 
final stages of the 
war, which ultimately 
led to the LTTE’s 
military collapse 
and a devastating 
humanitarian tragedy?
Yes, I still believe he had 
tremendous foresight. At 
the height of India’s support 
to the LTTE in the ’80s, 
he told me one day he 
would have to fight India. 
It shocked me. And that 
day came in 1987. He said 
the Indian, international 
role will determine the 
fate of Tamil Eelam. He 
was very clear-eyed that 
he and his family may die 
fighting for Eelam. Many 
tried to intervene, urging 
him to come to some sort 
of settlement. Nothing 
worked.
Why do you think he 
consistently refused 
to accept a negotiated 
settlement, even in the 
final years of the war? 
Was it driven by ego, 
unwavering conviction, strategic miscalculation, or 
something deeper within his worldview?
There were many opportunities for a negotiated settlement. 
In 1990, after the IPKF left, Premadasa literally gave him the 
Northeast on a platter. I thought this was as good as it gets—
take it and build on it. His answer was, ‘I don’t want their Eelam, 
I want our Eelam.’ There was ego, there was stubbornness, 
a steadfast purity of intent that is virtually unachievable, 
unrealistic in real life, and also a sense of misplaced loyalty.
When I asked him why he can’t settle for something less than 
Eelam, his reply was, ‘So many of my cadres have died for 
Eelam. If I settle for something less, they would have died in 
vain.’ As I wrote in my book, Island of Blood, he didn’t seem

to see the conundrum—by not settling for 
something less than Eelam, he was sending 
more of his cadres to death.
In your landmark interview with 
Prabhakaran, he famously said, 
“Nature is my friend, life is my 
philosopher, and history is my 
guide”—a line you once remarked 
struck you more deeply than anything 
you'd heard from a prime minister 
or president. But looking back, did 
he truly live by those words? He 
claimed nature was his friend, yet in 
the final stages of the war, he chose 
to entrench himself in flat, exposed 
terrain surrounded by sea and lagoon, 
effectively cutting off escape and 
ensuring encirclement. He said life 
was his philosopher, yet he rejected 
every opportunity for a negotiated 
political settlement, dragging his 
people into an unwinnable war. 
And he called history his guide, yet 
he ignored its clearest lessons—
refusing to return to guerrilla tactics 
and instead opting for conventional 
warfare against a far superior army. 
In hindsight, do you believe these 
choices reflect a betrayal of his own 
ideals? Or was he, by that point, 
blinded by conviction—or perhaps 
delusion?
I think that statement of his was bingo as 
long as he was a guerrilla fighter. And I think, 
at an individual level, it is true for most of 
us – nature as friend, history as guide …. I 
analysed his guerrilla actions in light of his 
quote, and I found it was absolutely true of his 
style. He used terrain to deadly effect, he was 
philosophical also in the way he spoke about 
larger concepts than something pertaining 
to him or the LTTE, and he had a deep 
understanding of history.
We all evolve in life. At 50, we are not what 
we were at 20. Prabhakaran evolved too—but 
that’s where I think he took a wrong turn. I 
wrote about this in the early 1990s. The IPKF’s 
departure was a big boost—he had kicked 
out the world’s third-largest army. Of course, 
Premadasa played a bigger role, but that’s not 
how Prabhakaran chose to see it. In his mind, 
the LTTE had evolved from a guerrilla force 
to a conventional army. This was a fatal turn. 
So many LTTE boys and girls got killed in the 
Elephant Pass battle that followed, where he 
fought a conventional battle. He couldn’t scale 
down, and eventually went down fighting.
What role did women play within 
the LTTE—both symbolically and 
strategically? Do you believe they 
were genuinely empowered within 
the movement, or were they, to some 
extent, instrumentalized in the name 
of revolution? While women held 
leadership roles within all-female 
units, it’s notable that no woman was 
ever appointed to command a mixed-
gender fighting force. How would you 
assess the LTTE’s approach to gender, 
empowerment, and leadership?
It was a male-oriented organisation, no 
question about it. Women came later to 
supplement fighting men. There were plenty of</p>

way? At times, some 
critics perceived 
your work as being 
sympathetic to 
the LTTE. How did 
you navigate such 
criticisms while 
upholding your 
journalistic integrity 
and credibility in 
such a charged 
and complex 
environment?
I never faced any 
pressure from the Indian 
government, LTTE, or 
Sri Lankan government. I 
was probably the only one 
who had top access to all 
three groups. The reason 
they gave me access was 
that I never misreported 
either what they said or 
the facts on the ground.
In a slight twist from 
the Bhagavad Gita, my 
way has always been: do 
your duty—never mind 
praise or criticism. Stay 
steady on the ground, not 
allowing praise to take 
you high or criticism to 
take you low. I wrote what 
Prabhakaran said because 
I had access to him, not 
because I was pro-him. 
Those who hated him felt 
I shouldn’t be reporting 
him. I see why they feel 
that way, but I have a job 
women fighters—maimed, dead. They, too, were leading on the 
battlefront. I have met the leader of the women’s cadre. In their 
behaviour, there is no difference between the men and women 
cadres. Dedicated—men and women of few words, mindful of 
their duties.
Given the highly polarized nature of the Sri Lankan 
conflict, did you ever face pressure—whether 
from the LTTE, the Indian government, or editorial 
leadership—to frame your reporting in a particular</p>

to do as a journalist. I have not spared the 
LTTE from my criticism, but Prabhakaran 
continued to meet me—because he and 
Indian or Sri Lankan ministers knew I had 
no personal agenda, no malice. I was ethical, 
professional, trying to understand—not pass 
judgments.
Situations happen, history unfolds… whether 
we like it or not. As a journalist, I saw my role 
as understanding the situation in its entirety—
not just one point of view, however right it 
may be, or excluding another point of view, no 
matter how wrong it may be. Even illogic has 
its own, often self-defeating, logic. It may not 
be the winning or losing side, but it is part of 
the complex web that life is.
Actually, while I covered all the protagonists 
in this conflict, my number one priority was 
always the public. As much as I took JR, Rajiv 
Gandhi, Prabhakaran’s points of view, I always 
sought the ordinary person’s point of view. 
The most dangerous situations I have been in 
were not journeys to interview Prabhakaran, 
but when I was trying to talk to civilians. I 
guess this is also the reason my reports were 
different.
In your view, what were the key 
miscalculations or structural flaws 
that led to the LTTE’s downfall and 
the tragedy of Mullivaikkal? Firsthand 
accounts and UN reports have 
documented how, in its final years, 
the LTTE resorted to practices such 
as child abductions and targeting 
civilians attempting to flee. How do 
you explain this moral and strategic 
transformation—from a movement 
that took up arms to protect its people, 
to one that ultimately turned its guns 
on them? Looking back, did you 
observe any early signs or tendencies 
toward this kind of brutality when 
you first encountered the LTTE in the 
1980s?
The LTTE always had a brutal side to them. 
How can we forget the lamppost killings, the 
executions? Prabhakaran had zero tolerance 
for those whom he considered ‘traitors’—it 
was punishment, lesson, and deterrence to 
keep the cause a watertight ship. It’s okay that 
he wants to lay down his life for the cause, 
but to demand that of the public is not just 
unrealistic—it’s bizarre.
A characteristic of all strongmen is that they 
never groom a successor. There is no second 
line of defence when it comes to leadership. 
So the organisation—or state—goes crashing 
down with them. The LTTE was a liberation 
movement but it was also a cult revolving 
around Prabhakaran. When he goes, so does 
the group—though the ideology lingers. I 
don’t understand the end. There are no secrets 
in life. Eventually, the full truth will come out.
During the final days of the war in 
Mullaitivu, trusted intermediaries 
were reportedly approached by some 
LTTE commanders seeking surrender. 
Were you contacted by anyone within 
the LTTE at that time?
No
Several independent investigations 
and reports—including the UN 
Panel of Experts (2011), the OHCHR 
Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL,</p>

2015), and credible testimonies from 
survivors—have documented grave 
allegations of war crimes committed 
by the Sri Lankan military during the 
final stages of the war. These include 
indiscriminate shelling in designated 
No Fire Zones, targeting of hospitals, 
summary executions, and sexual 
violence against detainees. What is 
your assessment of the Sri Lankan 
military’s conduct during the last 
phase of the war?
Militaries do what militaries do. They bomb, 
shoot, kill. They have one goal—destroy the 
enemy and his infrastructure. In that mission, 
they care two hoots for hurdles, concerns, 
good practices. We see what is going on in 
Gaza today. The UN is a toothless body. They 
do the best they can—there are brave men 
and women in the UN—but in the end, it 
is the brute state power of the P5 and local 
governments that matter.
Prabhakaran’s story should be a lesson for 
all – Tamils and Sinhalese – that military 
means cannot achieve peace. States can use 
catastrophic means to achieve traumatic 
peace. What politicians on both sides 
must realize is that just peace brings huge 
dividends. Europe is a great example. It was in 
ruins after World War II. By avoiding war and 
pursuing peace and prosperity, it has become 
the admired “lifestyle superpower” of the 
world.
If the Sinhalese politicians pursue a zero-sum 
game, everybody will lose. Life is all about 
the possibilities of abundance, but you must 
choose to see it that way. In my childhood, 
shops in India had few items. It amazes me to 
see abundance today.
Sinhalese politicians don’t have to deprive 
the Tamils of their rights to grab a slice of 
the economic pie. If Tamils are treated fairly, 
what happens inevitably is that Tamils and 
Sinhalese together will bake an economic pie 
of abundance—and everybody gets a bigger 
slice. This is common sense, but also proven 
by historical experience.
Sixteen years after the end of the war, 
many of the core grievances of the 
Tamil people remain unaddressed. 
The Prevention of Terrorism 
Act (PTA)—widely condemned 
by international human rights 
organizations for enabling arbitrary 
detention and torture—is still in 
force, despite repeated pledges to 
repeal or reform it. Likewise, vast 
areas of civilian land, particularly 
in the North and East, remain under 
military occupation, with over 60,000 
acres still held by security forces, 
according to civil society monitors. 
Now, with the Tamil people having 
overwhelmingly supported the NPP 
in Parliament—placing their faith in 
a new political alternative—do you 
believe this government has both the 
will and the capacity to meaningfully 
address these long-standing issues of 
demilitarization, justice, and dignity?
I am skeptical because too many past 
promises have been broken, too many 
opportunities missed. Democracy is great 
when it brings in sweeping, much-needed</p>

changes, but not so good when politicians 
feel they have to mobilize their base to win. 
Then jingoism, prejudice, and bigotry come 
into play. The problem is that, in most cases, 
personalities cannot bring change because 
injustice, discrimination, and exploitation are 
baked into the system.
Despite India’s historic involvement, 
do you believe New Delhi is still 
committed to securing a political 
solution for Sri Lankan Tamils? PM 
Modi’s recent visit prioritized strategic 
and economic issues but remained 
silent on Tamil aspirations. Has India 
deprioritized the Tamil issue in favor 
of broader geopolitical interests?
It would seem that way. Other than those days 
in 1983, North India was not so exercised 
about Sri Lanka. The strong pro–Sri Lankan 
Tamil feelings also dissipated in Tamil Nadu. 
The mantra of the current era is deals, not 
ideals. It’s all about expanding markets, 
achieving growth. The world is busy—and 
wants to get busier—making money. This may 
not be such a bad thing. Sometimes emotions 
make solutions harder to solve.
Economic prosperity often allows the problem 
to recede. We see how Japan and Germany 
prospered out of trauma. India has taught 
me that you can’t always solve problems, but 
you try to manage them. Economic growth, 
provides time, space and opportunities to do 
that. I guess one must think positive.
Finally, looking at Sri Lanka today, do 
you see any realistic path forward—
either internally or with international 
support—for achieving justice, 
autonomy, or reconciliation for the 
Tamil people?
I think young Tamils in Sri Lanka, around 
the world, have a proud or nostalgic notion 
of their homeland. This is natural and good, 
as long as it is patriotic and not nationalistic. 
There is an important difference. The current 
phase of the Tamil struggle is not LTTE 2.0. 
It is young men and women, in Sri Lanka 
and the diaspora, who fight for justice in the 
modern way. They document, collect facts, 
data, accounts, stories, connect, disseminate, 
lobby, and try to get institutional redressal. 
They are doing that. They struggle in their 
own way to fulfil what matters to them, with 
means of their choice and competence, not 
with gun, but with words, paintbrushes, 
laptops, camera, mobile phone, contacts list, 
affidavits. Deals are won or lost, but ideals are 
universal; they may not always find a public 
arena, but they live in our hearts. Just because 
victory is not in sight doesn’t mean you give 
up the struggle. In story after story that I have 
reported, I have seen that injustice is harder to 
bear than poverty. To be human is to struggle 
for what is just–for us, for those around us, for 
those who came before us, and for those who 
will arrive long after we are gone.
