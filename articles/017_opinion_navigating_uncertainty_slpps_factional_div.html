T
he Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is currently 
at a crossroads, with emerging internal divisions over 
strategies for the forthcoming presidential election. A 
notable faction is steadfast in presenting an SLPP candidate, 
diverging sharply from another segment favouring support 
for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The pro-
Rajapaksa camp within the SLPP reinforced this perspective 
during a key executive committee meeting, though the 
dialogue was brief, pending the official announcement of the 
election.
In contrast, other SLPP members, notably those in high-
ranking government roles, lean towards backing President 
Wickremesinghe.
In a significant political move, Mahinda Rajapaksa's son and 
SLPP parliamentarian, Namal Rajapaksa, was unanimously 
chosen as the National Organizer during the SLPP's latest 
executive committee gathering. This critical role, formerly 
held by his uncle Basil Rajapaksa, represents a strategic 
shift in the party's hierarchy. Political analysts interpret this 
as positioning Namal Rajapaksa for potential presidential 
candidacy, signalling his rising prominence within the party.
Amid these dynamics, Chief Government Whip Minister 
Prasanna Ranatunga, a former staunch Rajapaksha ally, 
casts doubt on the SLPP's prospects of fielding a successful 
presidential candidate. His recent comments include a 
nuanced critique of Namal Rajapaksa's appointment, subtly 
suggesting that Basil Rajapaksa would have been a more 
suitable choice. Moreover, Ranatunga projects a timeframe of

five to ten years before Namal Rajapaksa could viably contest 
the presidency, hinting at the need for more experience.
With the presidential election slated for October and debates 
within the SLPP about a potential early general election - a 
proposal President Wickremesinghe has reportedly declined - 
the political atmosphere is charged.
The alliance between the SLPP and the United National Party 
(UNP), historically antagonistic, has surprisingly endured. 
Despite their conflicting views on whether the presidential or 
parliamentary elections should take precedence, both parties 
have struck a delicate balance to keep their coalition intact.
Political pundits believe it's unlikely that a Rajapaksha 
family member will pursue the presidency this year, citing 
several reasons. A core challenge is finding a viable candidate 
outside the family, a notion the Rajapakshas seem reluctant 
to entertain, fearing it could diminish their influence over 
the SLPP. Moreover, siding with President Wickremesinghe 
could trigger a wave of defections from the SLPP to the UNP, 
potentially weakening the former's position in subsequent 
parliamentary elections.
Winning the presidential race is often a precursor to success 
in general elections. This insight is driving the Rajapakshas to 
prioritize a general election. Meanwhile, the UNP, recovering 
from their 2020 parliamentary defeat, is pushing for a 
presidential election first, hoping to capitalize on President 
Wickremesinghe's economic recovery efforts.
Basil Rajapaksa's attempts to nudge President Wickremesinghe 
towards a general election before the presidential polls have 
been unavailing. 
However, the possibility of dissolving Parliament through a 
majority MPs' resolution exists, though rallying enough SLPP 
support for such a move, especially with some members now 
allied with Wickremesinghe, is a formidable task.
While the SLPP and UNP hold divergent election 
perspectives, a direct confrontation seems unlikely due to their 
interdependent relationship. Each party has its vulnerabilities, 
making their alliance a case of political necessity.</p>

The 1996 World Cup Semi-Final between Sri Lanka and India 
is etched as a red-letter day in our cricketing history. It's a game 
that is still spoken about at every given opportunity, even 24 
years later. And there's a reason for that. It was a typical David 
versus Goliath scenario. When an underdog triumphs over a 
favorite, it becomes a classic.
In this piece, I aim not merely to narrate the incidents on the 
field but also to delve into the thought processes and emotions 
of both camps during the build-up and throughout the game. 
In doing so, we will encounter many perspectives previously

unheard and unseen. (The insights shared 
here are partly derived from social media 
revelations by Sanjay Manjrekar, a member 
of the Indian team for this game, and Sri 
Lankan coach Dav Whatmore during their 
conversations with Ravi Ashwin and Russel 
Arnold in live videos.)
For those who cannot remember the details of 
the game, let's recap the proceedings so that 
the back stories can be understood better and 
their impacts analyzed. 
Synopsis- Sri Lanka vs India 1996 
World Cup Semi-Final, Kolkata
Having won the toss, India opted to field first, 
putting Sri Lanka into bat. Despite losing 
both openers in the very first over, Sri Lanka 
managed to post a challenging total of 251 
runs in 50 overs. This was propelled by half-
centuries from Aravinda De Silva and Roshan 
Mahanama, aided by useful thirties from 
Arjuna Ranatunga and Hashan Tilakaratne. 
In reply, India seemed well on their way 
to a final berth, with Sachin Tendulkar in 
prime form. However, at 98/1, Sachin was 
dismissed, courtesy of a brilliant piece of work 
from Kaluwaitharana. Commentating on air, 
Tony Greig asked, 'Will this be the start of a 
slide?' It turned out to be not just a slide but 
an avalanche. India crumbled to 120/8 on a 
deteriorating track, looking clueless against Sri 
Lanka's spin attack led by Sanath Jayasuriya. 
With the score at 120/8, the crowd became 
unruly, prompting match referee Clive Lloyd</p>

to award the game to Sri Lanka. As a nation 
of 20 million went to bed with reinvigorated 
dreams of a World Cup win, a billion people 
across the Palk Strait went to bed hoping what 
had happened was just a bad dream.
What we witnessed on the ground was just 
the tip of the iceberg. There was far more 
happening than what met the eye. Now, let's 
take a deep dive into this intriguing journey, 
dissecting the backstage events that shaped this 
unforgettable match.
The build-up to the clash
Both teams had dominated their opponents 
in the quarterfinals. Sri Lanka had ambushed 
the English batters with spin and decimated 
their bowlers with Sanath's brutal batting. 
Sanath's unprecedented exploits at such a 
critical juncture had significantly caught the 
Indian team's attention, especially regarding 
the power of the Sri Lankan opening duo. 
In the group stages in Delhi, Sanath and 
Kaluwitharana had ruthlessly torn through 
the Indian line-up, turning a mammoth chase 
into a seemingly minor task. As we would later 
see, this profoundly impacted India's strategic 
approach to the semi-final match.
Meanwhile, India had emerged victorious 
in their monumental clash against arch-
rivals Pakistan. On paper, boasting big 
names, Pakistan was considered stronger 
than Sri Lanka. Unlike the present, Pakistan 
consistently had the upper hand over India 
during those times. Having defeated them 
and fueled by emotional fanfare, the Indian 
team was on cloud nine. There was a sense 
of euphoria in the three days leading up to 
the semi-finals. Even the legendary Sachin 
Tendulkar recently admitted they felt confident 
about defeating Sri Lanka despite losing on 
the group stage. To put it succinctly, India was 
riding high on confidence, perhaps to the point 
of overconfidence, in the lead-up to the match. 
It was the perfect setup for the law of averages 
to come into play. The general expectation was 
that India's progression to the final in Lahore 
was a mere formality. India had everything to 
lose, while Sri Lanka had nothing to lose. This 
whole aspect significantly influenced some 
critical decisions that were to follow.</p>

The toss and the wicket
The Sri Lankans had executed their chases 
clinically in every game they played. Their 
performances against England and India 
were particularly impressive, showcasing 
the strength of Sri Lankan batting. They 
had effortlessly chased down India's target, 
racing to 50 runs within the first 4 overs â€“ a 
feat remarkable for its time, decades before 
the advent of T20 cricket. This display of 
dominance surely left an indelible mark 
on the Indian camp, as we would soon 
see. Additionally, Sri Lanka had solid and 
experienced players like Mahanama and 
Tillakaratne batting at positions 6 and 7, 
who consistently came to the rescue during 
mini collapses in the middle order in both 
aforementioned matches. Given these 
successful strategies, Sri Lanka seemed to have 
no reason to alter their approach.
However, the situation wasn't as 
straightforward as it seemed. Dav Whatmore, 
the Sri Lankan coach, revealed that upon 
inspecting the pitch on the day of the game, he 
noticed that the soil underneath was unstable, 
and the wicket was deteriorating. This was 
a clear indication that the pitch might not 
withstand the duration of the match. Faced 
with this dilemma, would a strong leader like 
Arjuna Ranatunga reconsider his strategy? 
Definitely not. When Whatmore voiced his 
concerns, a confident Arjuna, alongside 
Manager Duleep Mendis, asserted their 
readiness to chase down any target set by the 
Indians. The decision was firm: win the toss 
and chase. Whatmore could only wonder what 
the outcome would be.
On the other hand, the Indian team had 
faced challenges in their recent pursuits. 
They had lost to Australia while chasing in 
Mumbai and encountered difficulties at certain 
points against the West Indies in Gwalior. 
Additionally, they had chosen to bat first 
against Pakistan. Logically, in a high-pressure 
game like the semi-final, they should have 
opted to bat first. However, they had a different 
plan in mind, influenced heavily by the impact 
of Sri Lanka's successful chase in Delhi. The 
Indians were so intent on countering Sri 
Lanka's strength and pushing them out of 
their comfort zone by forcing them to set a 
target. This represented a fundamental error 
common in many walks of life: focusing more 
on disadvantaging the opposition rather than 
leveraging one's own strengths. In the eyes of 
the Indian team, Sri Lanka and their chasing 
prowess were inseparable considerations. 
The toss went India's way; the decision went 
Whatmore's way. India decided to put Sri 
Lanka on the bat. Whatmore was a relieved 
man.
The worst fears come true for Sri 
Lanka.
We can be zero for none in no time â€” this 
was Dav Whatmore's guiding mantra for 
the Sri Lankan middle order. Ever since they 
had reinvented their approach at the top of 
the order, the Lankan think tank was aware 
of the potential risks. While Kaluwitharana 
had been dismissed early against England, 
Sanath Jayasuriya had taken the spotlight. 
Both had provided swift starts against Kenya 
and India, so facing an early setback wasn't 
something they had encountered previously. 
However, when Srinath dismissed both Sanath 
and Kalu in the first over, caught by the third 
man, the worst fears of every Sri Lankan fan 
materialized. Yet, this aggressive approach was 
by design. If not for this strategy, Sanath's shot 
selection might have faced harsh criticism.</p>

The experienced Sri Lankan middle order, 
however, was ready for such contingencies. 
According to Whatmore, it was the experience 
and stability of the middle order that enabled 
such an aggressive strategy at the outset. Being 
prepared is one thing, but executing is another. 
The million-dollar question was whether the 
Sri Lankan middle order would rise to the 
occasion.
As Sri Lanka faced their worst fears, the 
situation seemed exactly the opposite for 
India. In hindsight, however, this scenario 
backfired on the Indian team. As Sanjay 
Manjrekar would later reveal, the Indian 
strategy was based on the belief that Sri Lanka 
was overly reliant on their two openers. India's 
game plan hinged on the assumption that 
dismissing both early would effectively seal 
the game. This thought process dominated 
their preparations, with the team spending the 
majority of their strategy meetingâ€”55 minutes 
out of an hourâ€”focused on dismissing the 
openers. This was undoubtedly a reaction to 
their previous encounter in Delhi. It was also 
the reason behind their decision to deploy 
Anil Kumble, their key bowler, early in the 
innings. However, this strategy did not play 
out as planned. The reasons for its failure, I 
will explain later. In essence, by concentrating 
too much on Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh 
Kaluwitharana, the Indian team missed 
the bigger picture. It's hard to blame them 
entirely; the extraordinary performance by 
the Sri Lankan openers in Delhi had reshaped 
expectations of opening batting and left a 
lasting impact on the Indian team.
Ignore Aravinda at your own peril. Pay 
the price later.
According to Sanjay Manjrekar, the Indian 
team hadn't paid much attention to Aravinda 
de Silva, a decision that, in retrospect, seems 
quite perplexing. However, a deeper analysis 
offers some explanation. Aravinda's significant 
performances in the tournament had been</p>

primarily against the less formidable teams, 
Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against stronger teams 
like India and England, he hadn't made a 
notable impact in the earlier games. This 
oversight turned out to be a major advantage 
for Sri Lanka. With the Indian team's focus 
primarily on Sanath Jayasuriya, who had 
effectively taken apart the stronger opposition, 
Aravinda wasn't at the forefront of their 
planning. In their minds, he wasn't the key 
player to be wary of, an underestimation that 
would have its implications.
Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lanka's captain, knew 
who his match-winner was. 'Keep Aravinda 
happy, and he will win us the games' was his 
firm belief, a philosophy well-known in the 
Sri Lankan dressing room. As the saying goes, 
'Cometh the hour, cometh the man.' Aravinda 
rose to the occasion, dismantling the high-
flying Indian team by smashing 66 runs off just 
47 deliveries. At the time of his departure, he 
had scored out of the team's total 85 runs. His 
innings provided the foundation for Roshan 
Mahanama and Ranatunga himself to build a 
substantial total. The magnitude of that knock 
was immense. Scoring nearly 80% of the team's 
total at a strike rate of 140 in an era before 
explosive T20 batting in front of a hundred-
thousand-strong crowd was nothing short of 
extraterrestrial excellence.
In their strategy, India compelled Anil 
Kumble to bowl with the new ball, which, in 
retrospect, resulted in a missed opportunity. 
Sanjay Manjrekar later reflected that this was 
a mistake, as he believed Kumble would have 
been more effective later in the innings with 
a softer ball, gaining more purchase than 
the other Indian spinners. Despite Kumble 
claiming Aravinda de Silva's wicket, this tactic 
had a significant opportunity cost for India, 
affecting their bowling plans during the crucial 
latter part of the innings.</p>

The awe-inspiring and intimidating batting 
displayed by Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh 
Kaluwitharana indirectly set the stage for 
Aravinda de Silva to excel in what he does 
best, especially when it mattered the most.
As Sri Lanka posted a total of 251 in their 
allotted 50 overs, the Indian dressing room 
genuinely believed they had the game within 
their grasp, especially with their proficiency 
against spin bowling. This confidence was 
understandable. The Lankan bowling attack 
lacked a seasoned leader; both Chaminda Vaas 
and Muttiah Muralitharan were still relatively 
young and lacked the fearsome reputation 
they would later acquire. With no significant 
firepower in the bowling line-up and an Indian 
batting order that had previously dominated 
the likes of Waqar Younis and his team, India 
had every reason to feel confident about the 
chase. Above all, they had the prodigious 
talent of Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, who was 
in exceptional form. With him at the crease, 
nothing seemed impossible. Surely, it had to 
be India's game to win â€“ or so the Indian camp 
believed. 
Sachin's crime- it's not as easy for 
mere mortals as it is for geniuses.
The problem with geniuses is that they 
can sometimes create a false sense of hope 
and security among their peers. By Sanjay 
Manjrekar's own admission, the Indian team 
was well aware of Sachin Tendulkar's genius 
at that time. They had become accustomed 
to playing a supporting role to his brilliance. 
Manjrekar, being a senior player from Mumbai 
like Sachin, played an apt supporting role 
himself, steadying the Indian innings after 
Navjot Sidhu's early dismissal. However, 
Sachin's ease at the crease on a challenging 
pitch could have unintentionally given the rest 
of the team a false sense of security. With the 
score at 98/1, everything seemed to be going 
India's way. Sri Lanka's hopes appeared to be 
fading.
A moment that gave millions of 
goosebumps- Little Kalu to the fore<br />
At 98/1, Sachin Tendulkar attempted to guide 
a Sanath Jayasuriya delivery to fine leg. The 
ball trickled down, and Sachin impulsively 
set off for a single, only to watch in dismay 
as Romesh Kaluwitharana swiftly dislodged 
the bails. As the replays confirmed Sachin's 
dismissal, Tony Greig's voice resonated with 
the question, 'Will this be the start of a slide?' 
Billions of Indian fans prayed it would not be, 
while millions of Sri Lankan supporters hoped 
it would. This pivotal moment rekindled belief 
in the Sri Lankan camp and sent waves of 
excitement across the nation. 
Dharmasena's beckoning smile and 
implicit message
As Sachin departed, the Indian captain, 
Mohammad Azharuddin, stepped onto 
the field. Sanjay Manjrekar recalls that one 
of the first balls Azhar faced from Kumar 
Dharmasena spun viciously and bounced 
unexpectedly, sharply contrasting with the 
ease that Sachin had portrayed. This delivery 
was a stark revelation to the Indian team about 
the true nature of the pitch. Dharmasena's 
smile, resembling that of a child receiving 
an early Christmas gift, sent an unspoken 
message: the Sri Lankans were now confident 
they were back in the game. Manjrekar, at the 
non-striker's end, sensed the same. A wave of 
apprehension swept through the Indian camp.</p>

The avalanche and the ending
From that moment, it was not just a collapse 
but an avalanche. The Indian batting line-
up disintegrated like a pack of cards on the 
treacherous pitch, overwhelmed by the Sri 
Lankan spin attack, led predominantly by 
Sanath Jayasuriya's left-arm spin. In a stunning 
turn of events, India lost 7 wickets for just 22 
runs, and even making contact with the ball 
seemed an almost insurmountable challenge. 
As disappointment mounted in the stands, 
the crowd's frustration boiled over, leading to 
disruptions in the game. With India reeling at 
120/8, Sri Lanka's path to the final in Lahore 
was all but secured.
However, some minds wondered whether 
India could have pulled off a miracle through 
Kumble and Kambli. At least the Indian camp 
felt there was no chance.
According to Sanjay Manjrekar, the sentiment 
in the Indian camp was one of resignation; 
they felt the game was slipping away. Vinod 
Kambli, who wasn't having his best series, was 
at the crease, but the likelihood of him turning 
the game around in such a dire situation 
seemed incredibly slim. Manjrekar pointed 
out that, on a treacherous pitch like that, with 
ample overs remaining for the Sri Lankan 
spinners to exploit, any hopes of a comeback 
were exceedingly optimistic. This insight from 
Manjrekar sheds light on one of the lingering 
questions in the minds of many cricket fans 
about that decisive phase of the game.
And just like that, one of the most 
unforgettable games in Sri Lankan cricketing 
folklore reached its conclusion. What ensued 
was the fulfillment of one of the most 
cherished fairy tales in cricket history.
But as they say, it may not have been possible 
had the flip of the coin gone the other way or 
the ball gone wide of Kaluwitharana.
But it's when such little moments go one's 
way that bigger things transpire, which is the 
beauty of life and cricket.</p>
