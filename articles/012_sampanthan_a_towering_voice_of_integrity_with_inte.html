Sampanthan: A Towering 
Voice of Integrity with 
International Reputation
Regardless of opinions, the truth remains that 
despite various challenges and severe criticisms 
throughout his career, R. Sampanthan 
maintained a significant influence in Tamil 
nationalist politics, particularly within the 
political landscape of the Eelam Tamils. 
His stature was unparalleled, with no other 
contemporary figure able to rival his standing.
Sampanthan's influence extended far beyond 
the Tamil political sphere, earning him 
widespread respect internationally and from 
other communities in Sri Lanka. While many 
Tamil leaders struggled to gain recognition 
outside their immediate circles, Sampanthan's 
standing was notably higher on the global 
stage. His ability to transcend ethnic and 
national boundaries set him apart, making him 
a unique and respected figure in both national 
and international political arenas.
Sampanthan's reputation was not solely 
based on his political activities or leadership 
qualities but on his unwavering commitment 
to a moderate and inclusive political stance. 
This approach garnered him accolades and 
recognition that few other Tamil leaders could 
achieve. His diplomatic efforts and dedication 
to a united Sri Lanka, while advocating for 
Tamil rights, resonated with the international 
community and other ethnic groups within 
the country. His value was greater outside the 
Tamil sphere than within it.

After the annihilation of the LTTE, 
Sampanthan's political stance underwent a 
significant transformation. Moving away from 
traditional hardline Tamil nationalism, he 
adopted a notably more moderate approach. 
He aimed to work inclusively with other 
ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, 
incorporating a multi-ethnic perspective and 
an international viewpoint into his politics. By 
distancing himself from the identity associated 
with the Tigers, Sampanthan sought to reshape 
the external environment to align with his 
vision.
One of Sampanthan's key objectives was to 
establish that the Tamil National Alliance 
(TNA) and its politics were not a continuation 
or reincarnation of the LTTE. He openly stated 
this numerous times, believing that only by 
doing so could he successfully advance his 
political agenda among the international 
community, the Sinhalese, and the Muslims.
In a symbolic move to support this position, 
Sampanthan joined then-Prime Minister 
Ranil Wickremesinghe in Jaffna to hoist the 
national flag, rejecting the Tiger flag in favor 
of the Lion flag. This act clearly demonstrated 
his commitment to a united Sri Lanka and his 
willingness to break away from the past.
Throughout his career, Sampanthan 
consistently pursued a moderate form of Tamil 
nationalism. Unlike the hardline stance that 
fiercely opposed everything, his approach was 
characterized by a willingness to compromise 
and seek common ground. He believed that 
this was the only way to achieve a just solution 
within a united Sri Lanka, emphasizing the 
importance of inclusivity and reconciliation.
This perspective allowed Sampanthan to boldly 
advocate for a just federal solution within a 
united Sri Lanka, earning him respect from 
both Sinhalese and Muslim communities. 
Sampanthan's fair understanding of the post-
2009 context drove his belief that post-Tigers 
politics should aim for unity rather than 
division. He recognized the need for equality, 
understanding, and compromise, leaving no 
room for extremism. Thus, his politics aligned 
with principles of consensus, agreement, 
and democracy, which the international 
community also supported. Sampanthan 
believed this was achievable in Sri Lanka and 
steadfastly maintained this as his political 
stance.
He never indulged in cheap politics, and the 
LTTE era was a black mark on his otherwise 
integrity-driven political career. He did not 
amass fortunes through his political endeavors 
and lived a humble life.
In his later years, he was deeply committed 
to solving the ethnic issue in his own way, 
and the world also somewhat believed that 
Sampanthan's time was best suited to solve this 
never-ending ethnic issue.
Ashok Kantha, the former High Commissioner 
to Sri Lanka, who frequently met with 
Sampanthan and Mahinda Rajapaksa between 
2010 and 2013 to advocate for a solution to 
the ethnic issue, described Sampanthan in a 
tweet as a "towering personality and voice of 
sanity and moderation in [the] fractured polity 
of Sri Lanka. [He] worked tirelessly for the 
settlement of the ethnic issue."
Kantha added, "I recall telling President 
Rajapaksa and other Sri Lankan leaders that 
they should resolve the ethnic issue while 
Sampanthan was around."
This phrase best sums up his international 
reputation.</p>
