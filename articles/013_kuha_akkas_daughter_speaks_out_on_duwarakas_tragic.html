T
he daughter of Captain Karan (Vaithilingam 
Manoharan) and Kuhaneswary has made 
a Facebook post that provides insights into the 
fate of Duwaraka. Captain Karan was one of the 
seventeen LTTE members who, in 1987, took their 
lives along with senior leaders Kumarappa and 
Pulendran. 
Karan's brother, Colonel Shankar, who later 
married Karan's widow Kuhaneswary in a 
union facilitated by the LTTE, was the architect 
of the organization's air and naval divisions. 
Kuhaneswary was respectfully referred to within 
the LTTE circle as Kuha Akka (elder sister). She 
was a close friend of Mathivathani, Prabhakaran's

on Duwaraka's Tragic End

wife. Interestingly, within the LTTE, commanders and 
fighters humorously referred to both as the "kitchen 
cabinet." Kuha Akka demonstrated her loyalty and 
commitment by refusing to leave the embattled Wanni and 
choosing to remain there instead. Being a close friend of 
Mathivathani Prabhakaran, Kuha reportedly promised to 
stay by the side of Prabhakaran's son, Charles Anthony, 
until the very end. Kuha Akka, along with Charles 
Anthony, were reported dead after the fighting concluded. 
Both Captain Karan and Colonel Shankar were related to 
the LTTE leader Prabhakaran.
The 'Jaffna Monitor' has chosen not to 
disclose the name of Captain Karan's 
daughter, also Colonel Shankar's 
stepdaughter, citing concerns for her 
security and safety. Credible sources 
indicate that she attended school with 
Duwarka, where they developed a close 
friendship. Given security concerns, 
Duwarka was restricted in her social 
interactions, only allowed to mingle with 
a select few girls, among whom Karan's 
daughter was included. This unique bond 
places her as a critical living witness to the 
final stages of the conflict that shaped their 
lives.
Her Facebook post has been widely 
shared, including by Raheem, a colorful 
figure in the LTTE's history, who was 
the spokesperson for the LTTE's regional 
commander in Jaffna, Kittu.
This is her post: 
To those who keep asking if Duvaraga is gonna give the 
speech!
The real one is no more! I saw her dead body and her 
mother's too! I spent a whole year in 2009 searching for 
the people. I am not going to share those images as I saw 
how my mother's dead body pictures were morphed into 
pornographic images. Very elaborative images - some army 
men insert their guns into her body! Even my worst enemy 
should not go through (seeing) such horror images of their 
mothers.
I don't speak about those images much, as those images 
still haunt me! I DON'T HAVE THE ENERGY to see 
another mother's and sister's images circulated similarly. 
Hence, I am against those images coming 
out. I know if their dead body pictures 
come out, people can't misuse their names.
I don't care how many families get fooled 
and give money. You all are 30+, and you 
should know Veluppillai Prabhakaran's 
children would never start a movement 
because they know if they do, then the 
people in Vanni will get tortured. And 
they would never ask for money like this! 
Common sense!
Many called me selfish for saying that I 
can't see their images being morphed into 
pornographic images over people getting 
fooled. Yes, I am selfish because it is my 
family. We don't even hug or shake hands 
in Vanni, but I kiss her on her forehead 
whenever I see her. She is my baby sister 
and best friend. I will do everything in my 
capacity to not let those images come out!
And I am tired of saying they are no more. It is so painful, 
even after 14 years.

T
he disbelief among some Tamils regarding the de-
mise of Prabhakaran has its roots in the post-2009 
activities and stance of the LTTE's overseas branches 
and influential pro-LTTE factions in Tamil Nadu. 
These branches, financially robust and controlling a 
network of revenue-generating ventures and contribu-
tions, faced a radical shift in purpose following the 
LTTE's military defeat.
The overseas operations of the 
LTTE, once a mighty finan-
cial pillar supporting their war 
efforts with Prabhakaran at 
its heart, found themselves in 
uncharted waters. The death of 
Prabhakaran ostensibly pulled 
the rug from under these opera-
tions. The raison d'être for their 
fundraising and commercial 
enterprises seemed to disappear 
into thin air.
Yet, in this vacuum of official 
mourning, a different narra-
tive began to simmer. Despite 
Kumaran Pathmanathan or KP, 
the LTTE's chief arms procurer, 
declaring Prabhakaran's death 
in May 2009, a conspicuous absence of formal remem-
brance by political parties sympathetic to Tamil rights 
or those aligning with Prabhakaran's ideologies left a 
palpable void. This silence around his death anniversa-
ry did not go unnoticed. It became the fertile soil that 
sprouted the beguiling tale that Prabhakaran might 
still be alive. This omission, whether intentional or 
not, offered a glimmer of hope, or 
perhaps denial, that was skillfully 
exploited by those perpetuating the 
scam, resonating with segments of 
the Tamil community who yearned 
for a different truth.
In the latter part of 2009, the over-
seas operations of the LTTE faced 
a major quandary. The group, led 
by Perinbananayagam Sivaparan, 
known as "Nediyavan," in Norway, 
along with other key LTTE activ-
ists, chose to deny Prabhakaran's 
death and promote the narrative 
that he was still alive. This stance 
was in direct opposition to Selva-
rasah Pathmanathan, or KP, who 
initially announced Prabhakaran's 
survival but later acknowledged his 
demise and called for mourning.

The denial of Prabhakaran's death by Nediyavan led 
to a rift within the LTTE's overseas factions, with KP 
and others who accepted Prabhakaran's death find-
ing themselves increasingly isolated. KP's later arrest 
further consolidated Nediyavan's control.
This lack of official acknowledgment from the LTTE's 
overseas branches meant that there was no formal 
commemoration for Prabhakaran or other high-rank-
ing LTTE members killed in 2009. Annual observanc-
es like "Maaveerar Naal '' (Great Heroes Day) didn't 
specifically acknowledge Prabhakaran and those killed 
in Mullivaikkal.
In Tamil Nadu, despite initial claims of Prabhakaran's 
survival by some politicians, over time, many either 
changed their stance or remained silent, except for a 
few like Nedumaran, who steadfastly maintained that 
Prabhakaran was alive.
The enduring enigma surrounding the fate of Prab-
hakaran is further compounded by the organization's 
historical propaganda machine and the perceptions 
held by his supporters. Over the years, the LTTE 
meticulously cultivated an image of Prabhakaran as an 
invincible, almost superhuman figure. This portrayal 
was reinforced through numerous songs and narra-
tives that glorified him. Such propaganda played a 
significant role in shaping the belief among his follow-
ers that Prabhakaran was beyond defeat and death.
This belief was further bolstered by past instances 
where both the Sri Lankan and Indian governments 
prematurely declared Prabhakaran dead, only for 
him to resurface, alive and active. These occurrences 
reinforced the myth among a few of his followers and 
sympathizers that Prabhakaran was somehow immune 
to death. This backdrop of historical misinformation 
and the perceived invulnerability of Prabhakaran has 
been a crucial factor in sustaining the belief among 
certain sections of the LTTE and its supporters that he 
could still be alive despite official confirmations of his 
death.
Amidst this, various factions and groups claiming to 
represent the official overseas LTTE emerged, each 
trying to influence Tamil politics in Sri Lanka and 
Tamil Nadu. Some overseas elements also report-
edly financed and encouraged violent attempts in Sri 
Lanka, although most were thwarted.
This complex situation led to a fragmented and weak-
ened overseas LTTE, with individual countries or 
cities' LTTE elements operating autonomously. The 
properties and businesses previously under LTTE con-
trol were often appropriated by those in whose names 
they were registered. Meanwhile, the pro-Tiger world 
remained divided over Prabhakaran's fate, leading to 
a range of speculative claims and rumors about his 
survival and whereabouts.
