Katchi played a crucial role in shaping the 
government.
Even in the 1970 election, Thanthai Chelva was 
preparing to once again leverage the party's 
influence. However, the SLFP, along with the 
Trotskyist LSSP and the Communist Party, 
formed the United Front coalition and secured 
a two-thirds majority. This eliminated the need 
for Tamil Arasu Katchi's support, and with 
that, the party lost its bargaining power. It 
was only then that Thanthai Chelva remarked, 
"Only God can save the Tamils now," because 
the Sinhalese rulers no longer needed our 
support to govern.
Thanthai Chelva was always strategic, seizing 
moments when the Sinhalese rulers needed 
our party's support. He negotiated wisely and 
joined the government when it was necessary 
for our people. Remembering this side of 
his leadership when we consider our future 
political decisions is crucial.
Our struggle was taken over by the 
LTTE and ultimately fractured. What 
should the Sri Lankan Tamils do next?
The only viable path forward is power-sharing. 
In the North, Tamils are the clear majority, 
and in the East, they also hold a significant 
presence. If power is shared in a way that 
allows Tamils to govern the areas where they 
form the majority, these regions can retain 
their distinct Tamil identity. Without this, we 
risk being engulfed by Sinhala extremist forces.
The key to preventing this lies in the proper 
devolution of governmental powers. This is 
what we mean when we speak of a federal 
system. Even if it's not called 'federalism,' 
power-sharing is the solution. It will ensure 
that Tamils have control over their own 
regions, preserving our identity and securing 
a future where we can thrive as a community 
within a united Sri Lanka.
Many have accused you of being 
involved in Colombo-centric politics. 
What is your response to those who 
claim you do not understand the 
"We accuse the Sri Lankan government of war 
crimes based on international reports, yet those 
same reports clearly state that both sides were 
guilty of violations."</p>

sentiments of people 
affected by the war and 
are focused only on 
Colombo?
Colombo is the capital and the 
hub of decision-making. To 
effectively address our issues, 
we have to engage where the 
real decisions are made. As 
long as Colombo remains the 
political center of Sri Lanka, 
our efforts must naturally be 
focused there. But let me be 
clear—this does not mean I 
am disconnected from the 
people or unaware of the 
struggles of those affected by 
the war.
I am fully committed to 
representing the voices of the 
war-affected communities. I 
give equal attention to both 
securing our political rights 
in the national arena and 
addressing the real, day-to-
day needs of the people who 
have suffered the most. 
In the recent internal 
party election of the 
ITAK, your opponents, 
particularly S. 
Yogeswaran and others, 
accused you of being 
anti-Hindu and claimed 
you were involved in 
Christian conversions. 
What is your response to 
these allegations?
These accusations are entirely baseless and unjust. I have never 
mixed religion with politics and strongly believe in keeping my 
faith separate from my political responsibilities. Many people 
may not even know that I am a Christian, but I've never hidden 
that fact. I'm a practising Christian who attends church every 
Sunday, and I also serve as a preacher. I was the Vice President 
of the Methodist Church. Despite my religious identity, I have</p>

always drawn a clear line between my personal 
beliefs and my political duties. The Tamil 
people have never seen my faith as an issue, 
and neither do I.
In the recent Tamil Arasu Katchi leadership 
election, Yogeswaran used religious identity 
as a tactic against me. He announced his 
candidacy for the president post, but in the 
end, he asked his supporters to transfer their 
votes to Sritharan. Interestingly, Yogeswaran 
didn't receive a single vote—not even his 
own—which makes one wonder why he even 
contested the election in the first place.
It was a clever political manoeuvre by 
Sritharan, who didn't want to be seen as 
directly inciting religious sentiment, especially 
since there are Christian voters within the 
party. By using Yogeswaran to stoke religious 
issues, Sritharan aimed to attract those votes 
while maintaining a neutral image himself. It 
was a calculated strategy.
What is your personal opinion about 
Sritharan?
Sritharan has clarity, substance, and a strong 
ability to connect with people. I've known him 
for a long time, and he collaborates well on 
many issues. However, he can be influenced by 
others, particularly those with more extreme 
views. This might be a result of his experiences 
in Kilinochchi during the war, which may have 
shaped his tendency to quickly respond to 
hardline positions.
Is there any benefit for him in this 
behaviour?
I don't think there is a direct benefit, but it 
seems to have become part of his mindset over 
time.
What are his strengths and 
weaknesses?
His strength lies in his remarkable ability to 
mobilize people and present his arguments 
highly persuasively. He has a natural talent 
for rallying support and making his case 
convincingly.
However, his key weakness is his struggle to 
communicate effectively outside of Tamil, 
particularly in English. Despite being a 
Member of Parliament for over 15 years, he 
hasn't made significant progress in improving 
his English. While this isn't necessarily a fault, 
it has led to a noticeable inferiority complex. 
At times, he has expressed frustration, asking, 
"Do you think less of me because I don't speak 
English?"—which is certainly not how we see 
him. But it's something that weighs on him 
personally, and it shows.
Do you think he has been influenced or 
"bought" by diaspora money?
No, I don't believe he has been bought. 
However, when someone receives continuous 
financial support from abroad, it can become 
challenging to act against the expectations of 
those providing the funds. This doesn't mean 
he's been "bought," but it can create a situation 
where it's difficult to go against the wishes of 
his financial supporters.
