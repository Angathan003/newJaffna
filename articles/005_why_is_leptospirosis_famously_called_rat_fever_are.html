caused by Cyclone Pengal, our house in 
the Vadamarachchi region was partially 
submerged. Soon after the floodwaters 
receded, my father began feeling unwell. 
Initially, it seemed like a regular fever, but he 
later developed a high fever, chills, and severe 
body pain. When the symptoms persisted and 
his condition worsened, we took him to the 
local clinic. The doctors prescribed antibiotics, 
but his condition deteriorated rapidly. By the 
time we rushed him to the Point Pedro Base 
Hospital, it was too late," he recounted.
Health authorities are continuing their efforts 
to raise awareness about the disease while 
ensuring adequate medical support in affected 
areas. Residents are encouraged to remain 
vigilant and comply with health guidelines to 
curb the spread of the illness.
Specialist Highlights Preventive 
Measures for Leptospirosis
Dr. Pirasath 
Selladurai, a 
Specialist Physician 
in Internal 
Medicine at the 
Base Hospital in 
Manthikai, where a 
significant number 
of Leptospirosis 
(rat fever) patients 
are currently 
admitted, has 
shared crucial preventive measures to address 
the ongoing outbreak in Jaffna. In a social 
media post, Dr. Selladurai emphasized the 
importance of community awareness and 
individual precautions in combating the 
spread of the disease.
The nickname "Rat Fever" sticks because rats are 
the primary culprits in spreading the Leptospira 
bacteria. These sneaky rodents carry the bacteria in 
their urine, contaminating water, soil, and sometimes 
even food. Humans, unfortunately, get caught in the 
crossfire when they wade into floodwaters, handle 
soil, or even drink untreated water unknowingly 
laced with this bacterial hitchhiker.
But are rats the only villains? Not really! While 
they're the poster creatures for the disease, other 
animals like cattle, dogs, and pigs can also play 
a role. However, because rats are so ubiquitous, 
particularly in urban and flood-prone areas, they've 
taken the spotlight in the "Rat Fever" story. 
Why is Leptospirosis famously called "Rat 
Fever"? Are rats the real villains here?</p>

Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection commonly 
transmitted through water contaminated by 
animal urine, can lead to severe symptoms, 
including high fever and respiratory 
complications. Dr. Pirasath Selladurai outlined 
the following preventive measures to reduce 
the risk of infection:
Avoid Contaminated Water: Refrain from 
swimming, wading, or bathing in potentially 
contaminated water, especially after heavy 
rainfall, floods, or hurricanes. Do not ingest 
floodwater under any circumstances.
Treat Drinking Water: Ensure drinking water 
is safe by boiling it or using approved chemical 
treatments.
Protect Open Wounds: Cover any cuts 
or abrasions on the skin with waterproof 
bandages to prevent exposure to contaminated 
water.
Use Protective Gear: Wear waterproof 
clothing, gloves, and closed shoes or boots 
when handling water or soil that might be 
contaminated.
Control Rodents: Store food, water, and waste 
in sealed containers to deter rodents. Use traps 
to manage their population.
Avoid Direct Contact with Infected Animals: 
Do not handle dead animals directly, and 
wash hands thoroughly if contact occurs. 
Limit interactions with animals that could 
potentially carry the disease.
Consider Preventive Medication: In areas 
where Leptospirosis is endemic, consult 
healthcare professionals about prophylactic 
medication.
Dr. Selladurai also encouraged residents to 
seek guidance from local Medical Officers of 
Health (MOH) or Public Health Inspectors 
(PHI) for additional information and support.</p>

affna's household surgeon, Dr. 
S. Raviraj, recently retired after 
over 40 years of dedicated service

personal wealth and comfort. His unwavering 
commitment to serving the people of Jaffna 
during such immense challenges has left an 
indelible mark on the region's healthcare 
system.
With over 25 years as a surgeon and 40 years 
of dedicated service in Jaffna, Dr. Raviraj 
has witnessed and endured the horrors of 
war, including the infamous Jaffna Hospital 
massacre by the Indian Peacekeeping Force 
(IPKF), from which he miraculously escaped.
Throughout his career, he has been 
instrumental in transforming the medical 
landscape of Jaffna, earning widespread 
recognition as the driving force behind the 
region's modern surgical system.
Dr. Raviraj's contributions extend far beyond 
his role as a physician and surgeon. He has 
mentored and trained hundreds of surgeons, 
physicians, and healthcare professionals, many 
of whom now serve across Sri Lanka and 
internationally. Data shows that the number 
of doctors in Jaffna pursuing surgery for their 
MD increased significantly after Dr. Raviraj 
returned to Jaffna as a surgeon. His legacy is 
such that in almost every family in Jaffna, at 
least one member has been treated by him.
He also served as the Director of Jaffna 
Hospital during one of its most critical 
periods, from 2005 to 2012. His leadership 
during crises was unparalleled, exemplified by 
his selfless act of personally delivering food 
to patients during a devastating flood, even as 
human waste flowed through the inundated 
hospital premises. Such acts of dedication and 
compassion have cemented his status as a true 
hero in the eyes of the people.
This is our exclusive interview with Dr. 
Raviraj.
Your decision to return to Jaffna after 
completing your MS in Surgery and 
overseas training is widely regarded 
as an act of selflessness, particularly</p>

as it occurred during a time when the 
war was at its peak and uncertainty 
drove many professionals to leave the 
region in search of safety and stability. 
What inspired you to make such a 
courageous choice during such a 
turbulent period?
It is a well-established and mandatory path for 
doctors to pursue advanced training overseas 
as part of their postgraduate education. After 
earning my MS in Surgery around 2000, I 
embarked on this journey, undergoing training 
in Australia and Singapore. However, my 
commitment to returning to Jaffna and serving 
my people remained unwavering. War or no 
war, Sri Lanka is my birthplace, and regardless 
of the challengesâ€”come hell or high waterâ€”I 
was determined to return and contribute to 
the place and people who shaped me.
You were the first surgical registrar 
produced by the Jaffna Medical 
Faculty. Could you tell me about your 
medical student days?
I entered the Faculty of Medicine at the 
University of Jaffna in 1979 as a member 
of the second batch of students. I studied 
surgery under Prof. Karunainathan, Prof. 
Vetpillai, and Prof. Sriskanthavarman; 
medicine under Dr. Mrs. Ganeshamoorthy, 
Dr. Sriharan, Dr. Nageshwaran, and Dr. Ranja 
Thayalan; obstetrics and gynecology under 
Prof. Sivasooriya and Prof. Thayalasekaran; 
and pediatrics under Prof. Ramadas and Dr. 
Vamadevan. I remain forever grateful to my 
teachers. I graduated in 1984.
In 1985, I completed my internship at Jaffna 
Teaching Hospital, working under Surgeon Dr. 
Ponnambalam and Physician Dr. James, both 
of whom were exceptional mentors and guides. 
Dr. Ponnambalam, in particular, nurtured my 
profound interest in surgery and was one of 
the key reasons I chose surgery and eventually 
became a surgeon.
After completing my internship, I was offered 
a post-internship opportunity to work under 
Professor A. H. Sheriffdeen in Colombo, 
a highly skilled and renowned surgeon. 
He selected me to work as a departmental 
registrar, a position that allowed professors 
to personally choose one or two doctors for 
specialized training in their departmentsâ€”a 
role that no longer exists today.
Professor Sheriffdeen invited me to Colombo, 
but at the time, Jaffna Teaching Hospital 
was grappling with a severe staff shortage. 
Dr. Nachinarkiniyan, the Director of Jaffna 
Hospital, expressed his concerns, saying, "If 
all of you leave, we won't be able to manage 
the hospital." Additionally, my mentor, 
Dr.Ganesaratnam, whom I deeply respected, 
strongly wished for me to remain in Jaffna. As 
a result, I decided to stay, where I worked as a 
Senior House Officer (SHO) for six years.
After passing the MD Part 1 exam, I was 
again offered the opportunity to work as 
a registrar under Professor N. Jayasekara. 
However, during this time, Dr. Kanesaratnam, 
an eminent surgeon and my mentor, was 
working alone at Jaffna Teaching Hospital. 
He was managing four units and eight wards 
single-handedly. He personally requested me 
to return to Jaffna, stating that my assistance 
would be invaluable. He even reached out to 
the postgraduate institution to facilitate this 
transition. I could not refuse his invitation.
I am also deeply thankful to Dr. Ganesaratnam 
for another reason. Traveling to Colombo 
during that period was extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

When I first attempted the MD Part 1 exam, I 
needed to travel to Colombo to take the test, but 
a few times, I couldn't make it past Elephant Pass 
due to the war. During that time, Dr. Ganesaratnam 
advised me and a few other candidates working 
under him to stay in Colombo to complete the 
exam. Thanks to his support and encouragement, 
I finally stayed in Colombo, took the exam, and 
passed.
In those days, communication was extremely 
limited. There were no telephone facilities or 
telegrams, and the Northern Province was 
completely isolated. Even exam results were not 
immediately available; it often took about a month 
for us to receive the results after they were released.
The Jaffna Hospital massacre by the Indian 
Peacekeeping Forces occurred while you 
were working there. You were one of the 
survivors and lived to recount the tale of 
that horrendous act by the Indian troops. 
Could you share your experience?
Yes, it was an unimaginably harrowing experience. 
The massacre occurred on October 21, 1987, 
coinciding with Deepavali Day. On that tragic day, 
the Indian Peacekeeping Force, which had arrived 
with a mandate to assist us, turned their weapons 
against us in an act of sheer brutality.
All the doctors on duty that day were inside the 
hospital. The Indian military had surrounded the 
premises, trapping all healthcare workers within. 
When the Indian army stormed the hospital, 
they began shooting indiscriminately. Many lives 
were lost in the chaos, including my mentor, Dr. 
Sivapathasundaram, Dr. Ganesamoorthy, and 
several others.
Miraculously, a few of us survived. Just before the 
Indian army entered the hospital premises, Dr. 
Ponnambalam had gathered a group of us and</p>

instructed us to prepare the operating theater. 
As we were on our way to the surgical theater, 
the gunfire erupted. Initially, hearing the loud 
explosions, I mistook them for the customary 
firecrackers of Deepavali. However, the 
relentless roar of bombs quickly shattered that 
illusion, revealing the horrifying reality.
Not just us, but others who were in the 
doctors' restrooms also managed to escape 
unharmed. Tragically, around 70 individualsâ€”
including doctors, nurses, patients, and staffâ€”
who were in the administrative building were 
mercilessly killed.
Was there an attack on the Indian 
army from within the hospital 
premises by the LTTE?
I cannot say for certain. We were told that 
the LTTE launched an attack from near the 
hospital wall, but no attacks originated from 
within the hospital buildings themselves. Even 
if that were true, it does not justify the horror 
that followed.
Was this incident one of the primary 
reasons for the mass exodus of 
doctors from Jaffna to foreign 
countries?
This incident may well have been a 
contributing factor, but the exodus of doctors 
from Jaffna had already begun before it 
unfolded. For years, doctors in the region 
were severely affected by the ongoing war, 
enduring relentless shelling, aerial bombings, 
and shootings. Many felt they could no 
longer ensure their own safety or that of their 
families, prompting them to leave.
The massacre at Jaffna Hospital only 
intensified the fear and uncertainty, further 
compelling doctors to seek refuge and 
opportunities abroad. It wasn't just doctorsâ€”
during that time, a significant portion of 
Jaffna's population sought to leave the region 
due to the overwhelming sense of insecurity 
and instability.
You are credited with shaping the 
modern Jaffna surgical system. What 
was the medical situation like when 
you returned to Jaffna after completing 
your foreign training?
I returned to Jaffna Hospital in 1997 as an 
acting surgeon and later became a permanent 
surgeon after completing my overseas training. 
At that time, while healthcare technology 
was advancing globally, less than 20% of that 
progress had reached Jaffna. We struggled with 
even the most basic necessitiesâ€”something 
as simple as taking an X-ray was often a 
significant challenge.
The number of doctors was alarmingly 
low. At one point, there were only three or 
four medical specialists in Jaffna Hospital. 
Compare that to today, where we have over 
100 specialists, and you can imagine the scale 
of hardship we faced back then. This situation 
was further exacerbated by the severe shortage 
of Senior House Officers (SHOs), House 
Officers (HOs), nurses, and other health 
workers.
The workload was immense, but it was also a 
time of resilience and perseverance. Despite 
these difficulties, we take immense pride in 
knowing that we laid the foundation for the 
healthcare system that Jaffna enjoys today.

the war, like running motorbikes on kerosene 
and using bicycle dynamos to watch TV.
The challenges we faced were immense and 
multifaceted. The biggest issue was the lack of 
basic diagnostic facilities in Jaffna. We couldn't 
perform critical blood tests locally. For this, 
we relied on the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC), which transported 
blood samples to Colombo via their boats 
for analysis. This process naturally took 
time, often days. To this day, I am immensely 
grateful to the ICRC for their support during 
those difficult times.
One of the most significant challenges was 
the inability to conduct biopsies in Jaffna. For 
instance, if we suspected a woman had breast 
cancer, the standard procedure would be to 
take a sample of the lump (biopsy) and send 
it for pathological analysis to confirm the 
diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we had neither a pathologist 
nor the facilities to even prepare pathology 
slides in Jaffna. Without access to basic blood 
tests and biopsies, advanced diagnostic tools 
like MRI and CT scans were, of course, out 
of reach. When absolutely necessary, we had 
to send patients to Colombo for MRI or CT 
scans.
In cases where we strongly suspected cancers, 
such as breast or neck cancers, we had to make 
tough decisions. Given that biopsy results 
from Colombo could take a month or more 
to arrive, I could not risk delaying treatment 
when the cancer might spread further during 
that time. After thorough clinical examination 
and discussions with the patients, I performed 
surgeries based on clinical judgment alone, 
without waiting for biopsy results.
For example, I conducted approximately 
60 breast cancer surgeries under such 
circumstances. These surgeries were 
performed after explaining the risks and 
obtaining the patients' consent. Remarkably, 
out of those 60 cases, only one turned out to 
be tuberculosis of the breast instead of cancer, 
while all others were confirmed cancer cases 
when the biopsy results eventually arrived.
This experience underscored for me the 
irreplaceable value of clinical expertise and 
judgment, especially in resource-limited 
settings. While these actions may deviate 
from standard protocols, they were guided by 
humanity and the urgent need to save lives.
What other challenges and innovations 
did you experience?
One critical issue was the scarcity of anesthetic 
agents. We often relied on ketamine, which 
induces a state of dissociative anesthesia, 
allowing patients to undergo surgery with 
reduced consciousness and pain. This was far 
from ideal but was a practical solution given 
the circumstances.
We also faced severe shortages of oxygen. 
For non-critical surgeries, we used oxygen 
concentrators, which extract and concentrate 
oxygen from the ambient air. While not 
entirely reliable, this method allowed us to 
perform surgeries in dire situations.
Another challenge was the lack of appropriate 
surgical sutures. Different types of surgeries 
require specific sutures, but when we faced 
shortages, we adapted by using whatever 
was available, even if it was not ideal for that 
particular procedure.
Finally, blood scarcity was a constant issue. 
To overcome this, doctors, nurses, and other 
medical staff regularly donated blood to keep 
the supply going.</p>

The data shows that after you returned 
to Jaffna as a surgeon, the number 
of doctors who pursued surgery as 
their postgraduate specialty increased 
significantly. When I spoke with 
some of them, they mentioned that 
they chose surgery because of your 
influence. How did you inspire them?
I simply encouraged them and instilled in 
them a strong sense of commitment to their 
work. There's something profound about 
the commitment we bring to our profession, 
and I believe I passed that on to my students. 
For instance, when we worked hard and 
managed to save a patient's life, the heartfelt 
gratitude from the patient was a surreal and 
deeply fulfilling experience. I wanted my 
students to feel that same sense of purpose and 
satisfaction.
At the same time, I was quite strict with 
my students when it came to their duties. 
I ensured they worked hard by setting an 
example myself. I firmly believe that leadership 
in the operating room begins with the surgeon. 
I encouraged them to immerse themselves 
in surgery by actively engaging with key 
foundational subjects like anatomy, pathology, 
and physiology.
Anatomy plays a critical role in surgery, so 
I made sure my students taught anatomy to 
medical undergraduates. Teaching reinforced 
their understanding and made them intimately 
familiar with the human body, which naturally 
sparked their interest in surgery. Similarly, 
I emphasized the importance of pathology 
and physiology, encouraging them to work in 
relevant wards to deepen their knowledge.
I also actively involved my students in 
surgeries, letting them assist and co-work 
with me. I didn't fully delegate surgeries 
to them but instead assigned them specific 
responsibilities within a procedure. This 
allowed them to feel a sense of ownership 
and active participation in the surgery. After 
thorough training, I entrusted them with 
intermediate and minor surgeries, which 
further bolstered their confidence and sense of 
belonging to the field of surgery.
Beyond the operating room, we arranged 
regular lecture sessions and discussion 
forums for our students. Despite the limited 
internet access at the time, we managed 
to connect with counterparts in Colombo 
for collaborative discussions. These efforts 
enriched their knowledge and broadened their 
exposure.
Today, many of my students are working</p>

as surgeons and physicians, and I feel 
immense pride and happiness seeing their 
accomplishments.
Approximately how many of your 
students are surgeons and physicians 
now?
It's difficult to calculate precisely, but I 
can confidently say hundreds of them are 
practicing surgeons and physicians today.
The medical professionals we spoke to 
say you were instrumental in making 
the medical field in Jaffna more 
efficient. What did you actually do?
I believe my contribution was smallâ€”it has 
always been a team effort involving everyone. 
My role was to encourage and inspire those 
around me. Thankfully, I have been blessed 
with a certain wisdom, which I attribute to 
God. For me, sincerity, honesty, punctuality, 
and, above all, commitment are paramount.
I would especially like to emphasize the 
importance of commitment, as it forms the 
foundation for everything. When we lead 
with commitmentâ€”whether it's in our work, 
teaching, or patient careâ€”it naturally inspires 
others to follow and respect us.
Why do you think there is a negative 
public perception of doctors and the 
medical field despite the vast majority 
of Jaffna doctors being committed and 
not money-minded?
This is a very complex and sensitive question, 
but I'll do my best to address it based on my 
observations. One of the primary reasons for 
negative perceptions is people's expectations. 
When a patient visits a doctor, they often 
expect to be completely cured without 
any complications or setbacks. This is not 
something I blame them for, nor do I see it as 
a faultâ€”it is simply human nature. However, 
I believe this tendency is slightly more 
pronounced in Sri Lankan Tamil society.
There is always a delicate balance between 
people's expectations and the services we 
provide. Even when we give 100% effort and 
dedication, there are situations that are beyond 
our control. Not all outcomes are within our 
power.
That said, I also acknowledge that mistakes 
have occurred on the part of some doctors, 
nurses, and medical staff. No one is perfect, 
and errors can happen in any field. To address 
this, we must strengthen our public relations 
and interactions with patients.
In my experience, 90% of patients' perception 
of their care depends on how they are 
treatedâ€”not just medically, but personally. 
Unfortunately, not all doctors excel in this 
area, and this can contribute to negative 
perceptions.
To overcome these challenges, we need 
to focus on building trust and empathy 
with patients. Effective communication, 
transparency, and a compassionate approach 
can go a long way in bridging the gap between 
expectations and reality. I believe that by 
doing so, we can ultimately reduce negative 
perceptions of the medical field.
Do you think, as some claim on social 
media, that Jaffna doctors are greedy 
or work purely for money?
I wouldn't agree with that claim. The reality is</p>

that living solely on a government salary has 
become nearly impossible due to the soaring 
cost of living. Like everyone else, doctors also 
face financial challenges. As long as they earn 
money through government-approved private 
practices, there is nothing inherently wrong. 
Private practice, when conducted ethically 
and with a focus on the patient's well-being, 
is a legitimate way for doctors to support 
themselves.
That said, private practice must always be 
carried out responsibly, with integrity, and 
with the awareness of not imposing undue 
financial burdens on patients. If anyone were 
to misuse private practice, I would consider 
it a grave mistake. However, the majority of 
doctors operate with a strong conscience and 
dedication to their profession.
At the same time, I'd like to address the 
narratives on social media. Social media 
often tends to focus disproportionately on 
the negative aspects of the medical profession 
while neglecting the positive contributions 
of doctors. This one-sided portrayal shapes 
public perception and can create undue 
hostility toward medical professionals. I'm not 
asking social media users or content creators 
to glorify us; I request that they present a 
balanced and truthful narrative, highlighting 
both the challenges and the progress in the 
field.
For example, when facilities at Chavakachcheri 
Hospital were closed, social media was quick 
to highlight the issue, which was constructive 
criticism and helped bring attention to the 
problem. However, now that the hospital's 
facilities have reopened and are functioning 
smoothly, there hasn't been the same level of 
acknowledgment or coverage of this positive 
development. This selective focus on negativity 
contributes to an unfair perception of the 
medical field.
Would this unwarranted criticism leveled 
upon doctors hurt genuine doctors who gave 
up the chance to have a lucrative life in foreign 
countries and chose to return to Sri Lanka?
Absolutely, such criticism can be deeply 
disheartening for dedicated doctors who 
have chosen to serve in Sri Lanka despite 
more lucrative opportunities abroad. Facing 
continuous harassment on social media, 
coupled with financial challenges and the 
recent economic turmoil, can lead these</p>

professionals to reconsider their decision to 
stay.
In recent years, Sri Lanka has experienced a 
significant exodus of healthcare professionals. 
According to the Government Medical 
Officers' Association (GMOA), over 1,700 
doctors have left the country in the past two 
years, primarily due to economic reasons. 
This migration is wider than doctors; nurses 
and other medical staff have also sought 
opportunities abroad, exacerbating staff 
shortages and straining the healthcare system.
Constructive criticism is essential for growth 
and improvement. However, persistent 
negative portrayals without acknowledgment 
of the challenges faced by medical 
professionals can be demoralizing.
You mentioned the challenges faced by 
the healthcare system. What steps are 
being taken to address these issues in 
the Northern Province?
I'm glad you asked. We are currently working 
towards building a robust and future-ready 
healthcare system in the Northern Province. 
Recently, we had a constructive discussion 
with the Governor of the Northern Province, 
Mr. Vethanayagan. He is a very cooperative 
and supportive leader, and he has promised to 
assist us in this endeavor. We are also in talks 
with the Ministry of Health to align our plans 
with national healthcare goals.
We aim to improve healthcare infrastructure 
and services across the Northern Province and 
set a benchmark for other provinces. We aspire 
to create a healthcare system that is efficient, 
accessible, and exemplaryâ€”a model for how 
healthcare can function across all regions of 
Sri Lanka.
We are still in the planning and discussion 
stages. However, I can confidently say that this 
initiative is a step towards transforming the 
Northern Province into a region where quality 
healthcare is a fundamental right, accessible to 
everyone, regardless of where they live.
You mentioned plans for developing 
the healthcare system in the Northern 
Province. What specific measures do 
you believe are necessary to ensure 
its success?
In my opinion, before focusing on 
constructing new buildings, we should 
prioritize ensuring that the existing buildings 
function at their full capacity. Currently, a few 
healthcare-related buildings in the Northern 
Province have been constructed but are 
not operating as intended. It's essential to 
thoroughly investigate why these facilities are 
underutilized or non-functional and take the 
necessary corrective actions.</p>

For the future, it is not enough to simply 
build structures. Every new building 
must come equipped with the required 
workforce, equipment, and operational plans. 
Constructing buildings without considering 
these essential elements leads to wasted 
resources and inefficiency. A healthcare facility 
is only as effective as the people and tools 
within it.
Our focus should be on creating 
comprehensive and sustainable solutions, 
ensuring that each facilityâ€”whether new or 
existingâ€”meets the healthcare needs of the 
population effectively. This approach will not 
only optimize resource utilization but also lay 
the foundation for a healthcare system that can 
truly serve as a model for other regions.
You mentioned the shortage of doctors 
in Sri Lanka. At the same time, 
millions of dollars are leaving the 
country as students pursue private 
medical education abroad due to the 
lack of private medical universities 
in Sri Lanka. Any attempt to establish 
private medical colleges here has 
faced significant opposition. What are 
your thoughts on this issue?
This is indeed a pressing issue. Sri Lanka 
should allow private medical colleges, 
provided they adhere to strict regulations and 
maintain the highest standards of education. 
There is no harm in offering private medical 
education locally. For instance, students 
who study international curriculums like 
the London A-Levels in Sri Lanka often find 
themselves excluded from the local university 
system. Why not provide them with the 
opportunity to pursue medical education 
within the country instead of forcing them 
abroad?
The issue with some of the previous attempts 
to establish private medical universities in Sri 
Lanka was the lack of proper groundwork. 
To establish a legitimate medical university, 
it is essential to meet specific requirements, 
including:
Regulatory Approvals: Obtaining proper 
authorization from the University Grants 
Commission (UGC), Sri Lanka Medical 
Council (SLMC), and the Ministry of Health 
to ensure compliance with national and 
international standards.
Infrastructure and Resources: Building 
well-equipped facilities, including teaching 
hospitals, laboratories, and classrooms, and 
ensuring the availability of qualified faculty 
and support staff.
Quality Assurance: Implementing rigorous 
accreditation processes and maintaining 
consistent quality in education and training.
The challenges faced by earlier initiatives 
stemmed from the failure to adhere to 
these principles. When basic standards are 
compromised, it inevitably leads to public 
mistrust and opposition.
To address the shortage of doctors, the 
government could also consider increasing the 
intake of students at existing medical faculties 
or establishing new public medical faculties. 
However, to curb the significant outflow 
of money from the country, allowing well-
regulated private medical colleges is a logical 
and necessary step.</p>
