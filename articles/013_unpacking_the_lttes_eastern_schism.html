T
he Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was 
established on May 5, 1976. Throughout its 27-
year history until 2004, the organization encountered 
numerous challenges and pressures.
In 1986, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
banned the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization 
(TELO). The Tigers' leader in Batticaloa, known 
as Kadavul, attempted to resolve the issues by 
negotiating with TELO members instead of resorting 
to violence. However, contrary to his approach, 
Prabhakaran, the LTTE's supreme leader, ordered 
commanders stationed in the East at that time—such 
as Pottu Amman, Newton, and Kumarappa—to 
annihilate TELO and its members. Following these 
orders, the LTTE ruthlessly executed several TELO 
fighters, prompting Kadavul to leave the organization. 
This departure initially resulted in a significant 
setback for the Tigers in the East. Nonetheless, over 
time, the Tigers regained strength in that region, with 
eastern fighters ultimately becoming the backbone of 
the organization in subsequent years.

In 2004, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) and its supreme leader, Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, faced a critical juncture 
known as the 'Eastern Split.' This internal 
division presented challenges beyond the 
military sphere, encompassing deep-seated 
political and ideological issues that proved 
insurmountable for the LTTE leader and the 
organization.
The split was spearheaded by Colonel Karuna, 
also known as Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan. 
A seasoned LTTE figure, Karuna had devoted 
two decades to the organization and served as 
the military commander of the Batticaloa and 
Ampara districts. The schism threatened to 
alter the course of the conflict, influenced by 
a complex blend of political, social, historical, 
and economic factors. Central to the rift were 
profound ideological disparities between 
the Tamil communities in the northern and 
eastern regions, particularly the perceived 
dominance of Jaffna over eastern interests. 
This division marked a pivotal moment in 
the LTTE's history. During this time, the 
Jayanthan Brigade, a backbone of the LTTE's 
military successes commanded by Colonel 
Karuna Amman with about 6,000 fighters, 
along with other eastern regiments, announced 
their separation, leading to the Eastern Split. 
Following the 2002 peace agreement, 
the LTTE established its administrative 
structure, appointing 32 secretaries for 
various departments, all of whom were 
exclusively from the Northern Province. These 
authoritative decisions clearly demonstrated 
that the Tamil Tigers represented a dominant 
Jaffna-centric ideology.
At that time of the split, Colonel Karuna 
Amman wrote a public letter to Prabhakaran. 
In this letter, he explicitly criticized the Jaffna-
centric approach within the Tigers' structure 
and firmly stated that a unified administration 
between the Northern and Eastern Provinces 
was no longer feasible. He highlighted fourteen 
key issues as evidence to support his argument.
One of the key points Colonel Karuna 
emphasized in his letter was the significant loss 
of life among the fighters from the Batticaloa 
and Ampara districts during the conflict. 
He noted that out of the 6,800 fighters who 
had died in battle, approximately 4,000 had 
perished on the soils of Jaffna and Vanni. 
Despite these substantial contributions, none 
of the 32 administrative leaders appointed 
by the Tamil Tigers were from Batticaloa or 
Ampara. This imbalance led Karuna to express 
a preference for operating directly under 
Prabhakaran's command rather than under the 
appointed Tamil Eelam administrators.
Despite the severe issues Colonel Karuna 
raised, the LTTES' leadership neither provided<br />
a responsible answer nor sought a compro 
mise. Instead, they labelled Karuna a traitor to 
the Tamil Eelam cause and engaged in efforts 
to divert the direction of the narrative.
The leadership of the Tamil Tigers initiated 
military operations to oust Colonel Karuna 
from the East, launching attacks against 
the Eastern fighters who had historically 
been central to the organization's strength. 
This strategy entailed significant military 
engagements designed to kill Eastern fighters. 
The same LTTE leaders who had successfully 
negotiated with the Sri Lankan government, 
previously deemed an enemy, found 
themselves at a communication impasse with 
their own troops—individuals with whom they 
had shared meals and combated side by side 
for years.</p>

Near the Verugal riverbank on the border of 
Batticaloa and Trincomalee, a mass killing 
targeting Eastern fighters was orchestrated 
by Vanni LTTE commanders Banu and 
Sornam under the orders of Prabhakaran. 
Approximately 210 eastern fighters were 
brutally massacred. The attack made no 
distinctions between male and female 
combatants. In a further act of violence, the 
bodies of female fighters were desecrated; their 
garments were torn and scattered, leaving the 
scene in utter disarray.
On April 10, 2004, during the Verugal 
massacre, a ceasefire was in place, monitored 
by a Norwegian-led team. Just two days prior 
to this violent outbreak, the team temporarily 
withdrew from the Eastern Province. This 
departure left a critical gap in oversight at a 
crucial time, thereby indirectly facilitating 
the conditions that led to the massacre. 
As designated overseers of the peace, their 
absence at this pivotal moment also implicates 
them in enabling the tragedy.
Moreover, questions remain about how the 
Vanni Tigers were able to transport weapons to 
the Vakarai region through Omanthai and by 
sea. It is crucial to determine who authorized 
these movements. These truths must be 
exposed to ensure justice for the affected 
communities. In the current discourse on war 
crimes, the massacre during the ceasefire raises 
significant concerns. Given that this atrocity 
occurred during an international peace 
agreement, it not only constitutes a war crime 
but potentially an even more severe violation 
of international law.
Notably, the Verugal massacre, carried out 
by the LTTE during the ceasefire, stands out 
as a pivotal event. This atrocity marked the 
first major violation that undermined the 
integrity of the Oslo Accord and the 2002 
peace agreement, setting the stage for further 
escalations and eventual annihilation of the 
LTTE.
