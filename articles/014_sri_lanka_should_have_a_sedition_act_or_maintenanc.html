sins, they embraced the Islamic State ideology. 
The Indian and the Sri Lankan investigators 
are professionals. Their findings based on the 
evidence should be respected.
Nusrath was involved in selling imported 
telecommunication devices, phone accessories, 
and electrical equipment from Singapore, 
Malaysia, and Dubai and had a criminal 
history. In September 2020, Nusrath was 
arrested in Colombo for possession of heroin. 
Nafran was importing garments, shoes, and 
chocolates from India and Dubai.
The son of a notorious criminal, Mohamed 
Niyas Naufer, alias' Potta Naufer,' Nafran was 
arrested by the Sri Lanka Police under the 
National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act 
in 2017. Although Nusrath and Nafran had 
traveled overseas over 100 times, including 
to India, Faris, a porter, and Rashdeen, a 
trishaw driver, were on their first visit to India. 
Nusrath had a valid visa for Pakistan.
According to ATS, Gujarat, the Sri Lankans 
were "active members of the proscribed 
terrorist organization Islamic State (IS)" and 
are "highly radicalised." ATS investigation 
revealed that "they have conspired to carry 
out a terrorist attack at some place in India 
under the banner of the Islamic State (IS)." 
They arrived from Colombo to Ahmedabad 
via Chennai. Police officers were deployed to 
arrest them at Ahmedabad Airport.
The would-be-perpetrators-possessed:
1. A video on Nusrath's mobile phone shows 
the four men standing in front of a black flag 
with an Arabic inscription. They pledged 
allegiance in Arabic and Tamil to the Islamic 
State, vowing to follow the path shown by 
Abu Bakr Baghdadi, the former leader of IS, 
to punish those who commit atrocities against 
the Muslim community and to target Jews, 
Christians, and members of the BJP-RSS.
"Sri Lanka 
should have a 
Sedition Act or 
Maintenance of 
Religious and 
Ethnic Harmony 
Act to prevent 
people from 
insulting people 
of different ethnic 
and religious 
groups."

2. Five photographs and one video 
were found on the Proton drive used 
by the would-be perpetrators. The 
photographs included (a) a water canal 
with a probable landmark, (b) a parcel 
in a pink bag under the cavity of a 
concrete boulder, (c) a parcel wrapped 
in a pink bag and packed with brown 
adhesive tape, (d) a flag with Arabic 
writing in the middle and three 
pistol-shaped parcels arranged side 
by side, and (e) three pistols and three 
magazines loaded with ammunition. 
The black flag had the inscription 
'Mohammed is the Messenger of God, 
and there is no God but Allah' written 
in white and black Arabic letters, 
found during the discovery of these 
hidden articles.
3. A self-sent email was also found 
in Proton Mail, containing the grid 
reference with the latitude and 
longitude of a location. Investigators 
revealed that their handler, a leader of 
the Islamic State named Abu Pakistani, 
had informed them he would share 
photos of the weapons and the grid 
reference location, as well as photos 
of the place where the weapons would 
be hidden, through Proton Drive and 
Proton Mail. He instructed them to go 
to that location, retrieve the weapons, 
and await further instructions.
At the coordinates disclosed in the 
Proton Mail, the ATS immediately 
conducted a search in the presence of 
the suspects, where they found three 
pistols and one black flag in a parcel. 
All three pistols had star markings. 
Two pistols had seven rounds each 
in their attached magazines, while the third had 
six rounds, totaling 20. The rounds were marked 
'FATA,' and the serial numbers on the pistols had 
been deliberately scratched off to prevent tracking. 
Investigators identified the pistols as likely being 
Norinco Type 54 models, with the ammunition 
manufactured in the former Federally Administered 
Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan.
After Abu Pakistani's indoctrination, they took the 
oath to the Islamic State, became members, and 
received Sri Lankan Rs. 400,000/- in currency and</p>

communicated to their handler to receive 
weapons and ammunition upon landing in 
Gujarat for the terrorist attacks.
Given the recent arrests in India, do 
you think the Sri Lankan government is 
doing enough to monitor and prevent 
cross-border terrorist activities?
When it comes to the threat posed by the 
Islamic State, the threat to the subcontinent 
is common. The Islamic State threat in India, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, or Maldives 
can affect any country in the region. To address 
this common threat swiftly and efficiently, 
there should be an excellent relationship 
between Sri Lanka and India at a working 
level. The Sri Lankan Government failed to act 
on the threat intelligence on Easter attackers 
provided by the Tamil Nadu Intelligence 
through RAW and IB.
Had the Government of Sri Lanka enjoyed a 
relationship with Tamil Nadu Police before 
the Easter attack in 2019, the Easter Sunday 
massacre could have been preempted. The 
Sri Lankan Government has historically 
maintained liaison with RAW (Research and 
Analysis Wing) and IB (Intelligence Bureau). 
Given the rise of the Muslim threat in the 
subcontinent, especially in Pakistan and India, 
without further delay, Sri Lanka should build 
close relationships with the neighboring police 
intelligence and police counter-terrorism 
services.
Sri Lanka should advocate creating a network 
with the Indian state police intelligence, such 
as the Q Branch in Tamil Nadu, Counter-
terrorism units within their state police, 
such as the Anti-Terrorism Squad of Gujarat, 
and other entities, such as the National 
Investigation Agency dealing with the Islamic 
State and other threats.
It is too late to build relations after an incident. 
To monitor, prevent, preempt, and respond 
to cross-border terrorism, the Sri Lankan 
government should establish a dedicated 
multi-agency counter-terrorism center staffed 
by experts and specialists from the police, 
military, intelligence, central bank, and other 
relevant agencies. It is not too late to address 
emerging regional and global threats.
What role do you see international 
cooperation playing in preventing 
the spread of radical ideologies and 
terrorist activities in Sri Lanka and the 
broader region?
Governments working in cooperation, 
collaboration, and partnership are key 
to defeating the Islamic State, both a 
transnational movement and a pervasive 
ideology. To address the immediate threat, 
there should be a special relationship between 
India and Sri Lanka to jointly investigate 
terrorism. The intelligence relationship 
between the national agencies is excellent, but 
there should be a relationship built between 
the investigative authorities.
Historically, terrorists used Tamil Nadu to 
attack Sri Lanka, and today, it is the other way 
around. After Prabhakaran assassinated Alfred 
Duraiapph on July 27, 1975, he moved to Tamil 
Nadu and engaged the Indian Tamil separatists 
from Dravidar Kazhagam and, after the riots 
of 1983, infiltrated the two mainstream Tamil 
Nadu parties. After India turned against the 
LTTE, the Rajiv Gandhi murder was planned 
in Sri Lanka by Prabhakaran, Pottu Amman, 
and Sivarasan.
The assassin Kalaivani Rajaratnam alias</p>

Thenmozhi alias Dhanu was 
recruited in India, trained in 
Dindugal, Tamil Nadu, in the 
dedicated women's batch, and 
fought against the IPKF. The team 
that assassinated Rajiv Gandhi 
travelled from Sri Lanka to India. 
Of the dozen attempts by LTTE 
remnants to mount attacks in 
Sri Lanka since the war ended in 
2009, nearly half had links to Tamil 
Nadu.
Similarly, Salafi Wahhabi groups in 
Tamil Nadu, particularly the Tamil 
Nadu Tawhid Jamaat, influenced 
Zahran to create the National 
Tawhid Jamaat. Zahran's model 
was its leader, P. Jainulabideen, and 
he began to emulate his mentor. 
Intelligence cooperation preempted 
the return of PJ, a Salafi Wahhabi 
cleric in Tamil Nadu, to Sri Lanka. 
Additionally, Zahran's relative, 
deputy and ideologue Noufer 
maintained the largest Islamic State 
website in the Tamil language. 
The revival of the Islamic State in 
Tamil Nadu and Kerala should 
prompt the Sri Lankan police 
department to work directly with 
Indian state police departments. 
Therefore, intelligence services, 
law enforcement authorities, 
and military forces in Sri Lanka 
and India should move from 
counter-terrorism cooperation 
to collaboration and partnership. 
This should have occurred before 
or immediately after the Easter 
Sunday attack. It did not, and a 
multi-agency/multi-stakeholder 
approach is essential to prevent, 
preempt, and respond to incidents.
Like ASEAN governments built ASEAN OUR EYES 
to share and exchange intelligence, the countries of 
the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) should work together. 
IOR comprises of the Indian Ocean and the countries 
bordering it-- Australia, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, 
Madagascar, Somalia, Tanzania, South Africa, the 
United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The home to around 
2.5 billion people (one-third of the global population), it 
is the third largest ocean in the world, covering around 
20% of the Earth's water surface.
With the rise of the Islamic State Khorasan Province 
(ISKP), governments should wake up to the challenge. 
Today, ISKP operates not only in Central and South 
Asia. In recent times, ISKP has mounted attacks in 
Turkey and Moscow and attempted to conduct attacks

Asia-Pacific.
in Europe and the US. ISKP is 
supplanting the Islamic State core 
that reached its territorial and 
ideological peak in Iraq and Syria 
in 2014-2018. The IOR leadership 
should build a counter-terrorism 
network and an alliance to detect, 
disrupt, and dismantle threat 
networks that harm the region 
and beyond.
The future of securing the IOR lies 
in intelligence, law enforcement, 
and the military working together. 
They need to shift from mere 
networking and cooperation to 
collaboration and partnership. 
To secure the IOR, they should 
invest in six streams of activity: 
1) exchange of personnel, 2) 
common databases, 3) joint 
training, 4) joint operations, 
5) sharing of resources and 
technology, and 6) sharing of 
experience and expertise.
What lessons can be drawn 
from the Easter Sunday 
attack and the recent 
arrests to prevent future 
terrorist activities in Sri 
Lanka?
I have outlined the lessons to be 
drawn from the Easter Sunday 
attack in my book, "Sri Lanka's 
Easter Sunday Massacre - Lessons 
for the International Comm 
unity." Since then, the Easter 
Sunday attack has become a 
"political football" by power-
hungry politicians. They are 
exploiting it without addressing 
the threat. Today, the challenge is for the government and 
political opposition to develop a bipartisan approach to 
address all threats comprehensively.
In the ranking of preeminent security threats to Sri Lanka, 
the Government has rightly identified the following 
priority threats:
Religious extremism and terrorism
Separatism and terrorism
Organised crime, especially illicit drugs
Geopolitics
Cyber threats
As some of these domains are linked, the approach and 
strategy of the State should be to produce professionals</p>

who are both specialists with deep expertise 
and generalists with a 360-degree helicopter 
view.
Significant developments have been made in 
building a robust security and intelligence 
community, including infrastructure to train 
the next generation of leaders. With the 
transition from a unipolar to a multipolar 
world, a dedicated national security service 
should be established with expertise to protect 
the nation's economic and financial security, 
environmental and climate security, cyber 
and information security, and guard against 
foreign political interference.
As most of the threats originate from overseas, 
the Government should establish an external 
intelligence service to develop expertise in 
global and regional security threats, as well as 
geopolitics, geoeconomics, and geostrategy. 
Since national and international security is a 
spectrum, the foreign service, armed forces, 
and police should modernise by recruiting the 
best and brightest. They should be fluent in all 
three national languages and proficient in IT. 
Given their competence, the number of Tamil 
and Muslim officers in the ranks should be 
increased.
The Government should establish a degree-
awarding institution similar to the Fletcher 
School of Law and Diplomacy, the Edmund 
A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, and 
the Elliott School of International Affairs 
to professionalise the Sri Lankan foreign 
service. The police should create a dedicated 
division for national security investigations. 
The existing legal and policy framework to 
investigate and prosecute those who engage in 
online falsehoods and manipulations should 
be operationalised.
There is a precedent to the recent arrest of 
four Sri Lankans in Gujarat. It is not the first 
time that Sri Lankans and those of Sri Lankan 
heritage have been noted for their activities 
and actions. In New Zealand, Ahamed Aathill 
Mohamed Samsudeen from Kathankudi 
shouted 'Allahu akbar,' stabbing six people 
in the New Lynn supermarket in September 
2021.
In London, Sudesh Amman, another Islamic 
State member of Sri Lankan heritage, wore 
a fake suicide belt and randomly stabbed 
the public, injuring two in south London in 
February 2020. In UAE, 33 Sri Lankan men 
and women linked to the suicide bomber 
Fathima Jiffry promoting a "deviant ideology" 
and raising funds were arrested, debriefed, and 
deported to Sri Lanka in 2019.
In Chennai, another Sri Lankan, Mohammed 
Zakir Husain, was arrested for surveilling 
the US Consulate in Chennai and the Israeli 
Consulate in Bengaluru in April 2014. In 
May 2014, Malaysia arrested his Sri Lankan 
associate Mohamed Hussain Mohamed 
Sulaiman, tasked to ferry two suicide terrorists 
from Maldives to strike the two diplomatic 
targets.
Sri Lankans should understand that there is 
ongoing radicalisation of all communities 
in the country, and it has spread beyond 
Sri Lankan shores. This requires both the 
State and the communities to reform their 
educational, religious, and informational 
spaces and institutions. Furthermore, there 
is a geopolitical dimension where foreign 
governments are recruiting Sri Lankans 
to advance their interests. In addition to 
addressing radicalisation, the Government 
should develop a legal and policy framework 
to deter, prevent, and counter a range of 
national security threats, from foreign 
interference to espionage.</p>
