interview
BY:  Our Reporter
K
.V. Thavarasa, a prominent figure in the 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), 
President's Counsel, and a leading lawyer, 
has been at odds with M.A. Sumanthiran for 
years. Although Sumanthiran does not hold 
the official title of president, he has long 
been the de facto decision-maker, wielding 
significant influence over all major decisions 
within ITAK.
After being passed over as the party's 
candidate for the Jaffna electoral district, 
Thavarasa resigned from all his positions 
within ITAK. He has since formed an 
independent group, the Democratic Tamil 
Arasu Alliance, and is now contesting the 
upcoming election under this new banner.
These are excerpts from our exclusive 
"ITAK Is Now Sumanthiran's 
Pvt. Ltd. - I Stepped Down 
Because I Had No Desire to Be the 
Director of Such a Company"

interview with him.
You held a significant role within the 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) as the 
head of its Colombo district, among other 
responsibilities. What led you to leave 
the party and contest as an independent?
After the war in 2009, I was appointed as the 
head of ITAK's Colombo branch, and from 
that moment until my resignation, I fulfilled 
my duties with unwavering dedication. I never 
sought out positions—my loyalty has always 
been to Tamil nationalism, not political titles. 
For me, politics is not a livelihood, and the 
party is not my identity.
Sadly, over the years, many within ITAK 
prioritized personal gain over the Tamil 
nationalist cause. From 2010 onwards, 
the party gradually strayed from its core 
principles, succumbing to the whims of 
certain individuals. I raised these concerns 
with party leaders like Sampanthan and Mavai 
Senathirajah, but despite my repeated efforts, 
my words fell on deaf ears. This ultimately 
drove me to a point where I could no longer 
remain with ITAK, and so I made the decision 
to leave.
You mentioned that the party gradually 
strayed from its core principles, 
succumbing to the whims of certain 
individuals. Can you name them?
It's not a group—it's a single person. That 
person is Sumanthiran.
What specific injustices has he done to you?
In the 2020 elections, my name was initially 
placed at the top of the national list, a position 
I never asked for. Yet, within two days, my 
name was unceremoniously removed and 
replaced with Ambika Satkunanathan's—an 
arbitrary decision by Sumanthiran. I didn't 
question it at the time, but it was indicative of 
a growing trend of unilateralism.
By January 2024, during a central committee 
meeting at MP Shanakiyan's house to 
discuss the local elections, I witnessed the 
disintegration of the Tamil National Alliance 
(TNA). Aside from myself and two others, 
the entire committee had decided to contest 
separately. I vehemently opposed this move. 
The TNA, formed by our national leader 
Prabhakaran, symbolized Tamil unity, and 
allowing it to fall apart was, in my view, a 
betrayal of that legacy. Despite my efforts to 
preserve the alliance, the others seemed more 
interested in fracturing it for personal gain. 
Sumanthiran later suggested that those who 
left the TNA should return, but in reality, it 
was his actions that pushed them away in the 
first place.
Even during the recent presidential election, 
Sumanthiran's decision to support Sajith 
Premadasa was made entirely on his own. 
Although the central committee had agreed 
to appoint a group of six to review candidate 
manifestos, Sumanthiran disregarded this 
process. At a hastily arranged meeting on the 
day of the Nallur Murugan chariot festival—
knowing that several members would be 
absent due to the temple festivities—he 
unilaterally declared support for Sajith without 
proper consultation.
I have no personal vendetta or professional 
rivalry with Sumanthiran. But he is undeniably 
responsible for the downfall of our once-
thriving party. The TNA, which held 22 seats 
at its height, is now a shadow of its former self, 
and it's uncertain whether ITAK will even win 
two seats in the upcoming election.</p>

The once-vibrant house of Tamil nationalism, 
represented by the TNA, has been abandoned, 
with its former residents now scattered. This 
house does not belong to any one individual—
it belongs to the Tamil people, entrusted to 
us for safekeeping. Yet, Sumanthiran has 
transformed it into a private enterprise. I 
stepped down because I had no desire to be the 
director of such a company.
Why were you not given the opportunity 
to contest in the parliamentary election?
During the candidate selection meeting, 
a resolution was passed barring anyone 
who had previously supported the Tamil 
common candidate in the recently concluded 
presidential election from contesting in 
the upcoming parliamentary election. 
An 11-member selection committee was 
appointed to choose the candidates, but it 
wasn't the party's original committee—it 
was one handpicked by Sumanthiran and 
stacked with his loyalists. Aside from Mavai 
Senathirajah and Sritharan, the rest were mere 
puppets, bending to Sumanthiran's will.
In a general meeting, such a committee 
must be formally proposed and seconded 
by others, but that process was entirely 
bypassed. Ideally, no candidates should 
be part of the selection committee;</p>

however, both Sumanthiran and Sritharan 
were included, which blatantly violates 
natural justice. As they say, "Can I be my 
own judge?"
The committee claimed to represent all 
districts, yet Sumanthiran stacked it with four 
of his loyalists from the Batticaloa district, 
conveniently leaving out the Colombo district, 
where I was president of the Colombo unit of 
ITAK.
I knew my name wouldn't be selected as a 
candidate, but I still applied to expose their 
unjust actions. Had I not applied, they could've 
claimed that they would have chosen me if I 
had. That's precisely why I went through with 
it, fully aware that Sumanthiran's team would 
reject my application. Once the candidate list 
was announced, I made sure the world knew 
about their unethical practices, and with my 
resignation letter ready, I submitted it.
What do you think caused the decline of 
TNA and ITAK?
I place the blame squarely on Sumanthiran 
but also on the lack of leadership from the 
late Sampanthan and Mavai Senathirajah. 
Everything Sumanthiran decides is carried 
out within the party as though it were his 
personal enterprise, even though it's meant 
to be a people's party. If one person dictates 
everything, what's the point of having a party?
How do you view the candidate selection 
process for the Jaffna electoral district?
For the six seats in the Jaffna electoral district, 
nine candidates need to be nominated. Except 
for Sritharan, the other eight ITAK candidates 
belong to Sumanthiran's faction, and even 
Sritharan has now aligned with them. The 
entire lineup has been carefully orchestrated to 
guarantee Sumanthiran's victory.
It was explicitly stated that those who had lost 
in the previous parliamentary election would 
not be given another chance to contest. So why 
was Emmanuel Arnold given the opportunity? 
The answer is simple: he is a loyalist of 
Sumanthiran.
Sumanthiran also put on a grand spectacle, 
claiming they had been searching far and 
wide—through jungles and mountains, no 
less—for female candidates. Yet, when the time 
came, he announced two women as candidates, 
completely disregarding the four women who 
had already applied from the party's women's 
wing. Their applications were systematically 
ignored, while Sumanthiran perpetuated the 
farce of having scoured the wilderness for 
female representation. The women's wing has 
been sidelined, as has the youth wing, with 
Sumanthiran handpicking his own candidates 
in a blatant display of arrogance.
Are these women candidates members of 
ITAK?
I've been in the party for 14 years, and I've 
never even heard of them. No one in the 
party knows who they are. I'm not blaming 
the women themselves, but I place the 
blame squarely on the leadership. It's their 
responsibility to ensure transparency and 
proper representation.
Do you think this is a play orchestrated 
by both Sumanthiran and Sritharan?
No. Sritharan has no other option. He's a 
prisoner of circumstances.
But Sritharan was part of the selection 
committee, wasn't he?</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

Even so, he didn't have a voice there. Out of 
the 11 members of the selection committee, 
except for Mavai Senathirajah and Sritharan, 
the remaining nine were Sumanthiran's people.
Who appointed the selection committee?
That's an excellent question. The selection 
committee was appointed under the leadership 
of Mavai Senathirajah. When I directly 
asked him about the rationale behind the 
appointments, he was unable to provide a 
clear explanation. This is why I've consistently 
pointed out that Mavai Senathirajah's 
ineffectiveness as ITAK president has 
significantly contributed to the party 
becoming, in effect, a private entity controlled 
by Sumanthiran. The lack of strong leadership 
has allowed this centralization of power.
Why did you decide to contest 
independently?
We have now parted ways and submitted 
our nomination under the banner of the 
Democratic Tamil Arasu Alliance. The 
people, disillusioned by the autocratic and 
Sumanthiran-centric leadership of the Tamil 
Arasu party, will cast their votes for us. The 
Tamil Arasu party will struggle to win even 
two seats, while we expect to garner significant 
support.
If that's the case, why is Sritharan still 
with the Tamil Arasu party?
If Sritharan were to leave, the party would 
be completely under Sumanthiran's control. 
For now, it's better that he stays. There's a 
possibility that Sritharan may reconsider his 
position after the election, but for me, stepping 
away was the only necessary course of action.
If, as you claim, the Tamil Arasu party is 
becoming Sumanthiran's personal enterprise, 
where do you believe the core issue lies? Is 
it a problem with the party's structure, its 
leadership, or the organization as a whole?
The issue lies not in the structure or 
organization but in leadership. The root 
cause is the lack of effective leadership from 
senior figures like Sampanthan and Mavai 
Senathirajah. Leadership is key, whether 
it's a company or a political party. If the 
leadership is weak, nothing can function as it 
should. This absence of strong leadership has 
allowed the party to gradually transform into 
Sumanthiran's personal domain.
Do you think Sumanthiran is operating 
under the agenda of any external forces?
The Sinhala political agenda has always been 
to fragment us, and Sumanthiran is skillfully 
executing that plan. This time, from the Jaffna 
electoral district, a total of 23 parties and 
23 independent groups filed nominations, 
with 2 being rejected. This leaves 44 groups 
contesting for just 6 seats. The interests of 
southern Sinhala politics are being perfectly 
orchestrated in the Tamil region, with 
Sumanthiran as the chief architect of this 
division.
When Sumanthiran steps away from 
politics, what kind of damage do you 
think he will have caused to Tamil 
nationalist politics?
He will have completely dismantled Tamil 
nationalism. What he has done to the ITAK 
and TNA, and to Tamil nationalist politics 
from within, should be regarded as nothing 
less than a betrayal. History will remember 
him as someone who committed a profound 
betrayal against Tamil nationalist politics.</p>
