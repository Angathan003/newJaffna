T
he UK Proscribed Organisations 
Appeals Commission (POAC), 
an independent court established 
by Parliament and headed by a 
high court judge and two retired 
senior diplomats, has upheld the 
proscription of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
This decision rejects an appeal by 
the self-proclaimed Transnational 
Government of Tamil Eelam 
(TGTE) to remove the LTTE from 
the list of banned organizations 
under the Terrorism Act 2000. As a 
result, the LTTE remains classified 
as a terrorist organization in the 
UK.
The LTTE was initially proscribed 
on March 29, 2001. The Sri Lankan 
civil war ended in May 2009 with 
the death of LTTE leader Vellupillai 
Prabhakaran and the defeat of its 
military forces. Despite this military 
defeat, the POAC noted that the 
LTTE's international network 
remains active. According to the 
Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre 
(JTAC), from 2012 to 2017, there 
were activities indicating attempts 
to revive the LTTE's violent 
operations.
The TGTE, which advocates for an 
independent Tamil state, sought to 
lift the ban on the LTTE, arguing 
that it no longer poses a terrorist 
threat. However, unlike the LTTE, 
the TGTE is not proscribed in the 
LTTE Remains Banned in UK
Monitor Memo
UK, as it promotes its objectives through non-violent 
means.
The TGTE's appeal was based on four key arguments: 
the LTTE's current incapability of posing a threat, the 
surprising claim that there are no reasonable grounds 
to believe the LTTE is involved in terrorism, errors 
in the Secretary of State's discretion to maintain 
the proscription, and the contention that continued 
proscription violates freedom of expression, assembly, 
and association.
The Commission emphasized that even an organization 
that is currently inactive but intends to reactivate 
its military wing meets the criteria for proscription. 
JTAC's assessments confirmed that the LTTE's network 
has engaged in activities indicating an intent to revive 
the group. Incidents cited in the decision included 
an IED explosion by a former LTTE operative in July 
2020, the arrest of individuals with a claymore mine 
in December 2020, and a cyber-attack on a Sri Lankan 
government website.
While the TGTE argued that evidence from Sri Lankan 
sources was unreliable, the POAC upheld the decision, 
stating that no significant legal flaws were found in 
the process. The Commission also noted that de-
proscription could damage UK relations with India and 
Sri Lanka, aligning with the UK's Indo-Pacific strategy.</p>

affna, Sri Lanka – For many, 
the journey to accompany 
loved ones admitted to Jaffna 
Teaching Hospital is fraught 
with challenges and exhaustion. 
It's a heart-wrenching sight to 
see numerous patients' relatives 
sleeping on the pavement or 
staying awake all night, deprived 
of even the most basic comforts 
due to the lack of proper facilities 
at the hospital. Recognizing these 
immense struggles, a group of 
compassionate Good Samaritans 
has stepped in to offer a glimmer 
of hope: Sivasi Illam, a newly 
established sanctuary providing 
much-needed relief and support.
Recently inaugurated, Sivasi 
Illam serves as a haven for 
relatives and caregivers, 
providing essential facilities such 
as rest areas, showers, changing 
rooms, and sleeping quarters. 
This service center ensures that 
they can maintain their well-
being while supporting their 
hospitalized loved ones. By 
addressing the critical need for 
proper accommodations, Sivasi 
Illam offers much-needed relief

A Newly Established Sanctuary for Relatives 
of Patients at Jaffna Teaching Hospital

and comfort.
Located at No. 76, Hospital Road near 
Sathira Santhi (just beyond the market), 
the property for Sivasi Illam was 
generously donated by Dr. Ratneswaran 
from the UK. He graciously contributed 
his house for this noble cause and 
personally attended the opening 
ceremony.
Dr. T. Sathiyamoorthy, Director of 
Jaffna Hospital, stated that Sivasi 
Illam has been designed with care and 
compassion. He noted that the center 
features comfortable bedrooms and 
well-maintained bathrooms, ensuring 
everyone feels at home. He highlighted 
that this initiative, conceived by the 
Jaffna Teaching Hospital Welfare 
Society, was meticulously organized 
by Dr. Premakrishna, Treasurer, who 
led the memorable inaugural event. Dr. 
Sathiyamoorthy also acknowledged 
the generous financial support from the 
Saivite Tamil Foundation, USA, which 
has been instrumental in bringing Sivasi 
Illam to life.
Dr. Sathiyamoorthy mentioned that 
Sivasi Illam officially opened its doors 
to the public last Monday and is already 
making a significant impact. He urged 
the community to embrace this service, 
use it responsibly, and spread the 
word to ensure that no family endures 
unnecessary hardship while caring for 
their hospitalized loved ones.
When contacted, Dr. S. Premakrishna, 
Consultant Anesthesiologist in Jaffna 
and Treasurer of the Jaffna Teaching 
Hospital Welfare Society, shared details. 
He stated, "This shelter for patients' 
relatives is an initial step in a larger 
program. Currently, this house can 
comfortably accommodate around 12 
people. The only criterion we stipulate 
is that these individuals should be from districts 
outside of Jaffna or from the Jaffna islands."
Dr. Premakrishna elaborated on the necessity 
of this initiative, explaining, "Due to the 
comprehensive range of medical treatments 
available at Jaffna Hospital, we are seeing an 
influx of patients from various districts, including 
Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Puttalam, 
Batticaloa, and even Sinhala patients from 
districts such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, 
Kandy, and many more. The relatives of these 
patients, who often come as bystanders and are 
primarily from poor backgrounds, face significant 
challenges in finding accommodation in Jaffna. 
Hotels near Jaffna Hospital charge considerably 
high rates, and not everyone has relatives in the 
area. Consequently, these individuals face severe 
difficulties in finding a place to stay. We are 
committed to helping them through this initiative."</p>

He further explained the operational details 
of the facility: "This house will be managed 
not by the hospital but by the Jaffna Teaching 
Hospital Welfare Society. We have appointed 
two staff members to run the house. No food 
is provided for those who stay, but we are 
considering offering meals in a few months 
once we have a sufficient budget. For now, we 
will provide tea and biscuits at night for the 
bystanders who arrive late."
Addressing future plans, Dr. Premakrishna 
stated, "Currently, we do not have precise 
data on the number of people needing 
accommodation. After running the facility 
for a few weeks, we will gather insights and 
plan to expand this service to other locations 
as needed. Based on this data, we will make 
informed decisions regarding the expansion."
He also emphasized a critical aspect of patient 
care: "Many patients from other districts need 
to return for follow-up check-ups within a 
week after discharge. Unfortunately, many of 
them lack the means to travel back and forth. 
To address this issue, we are considering 
constructing a separate facility specifically for 
these patients in the future. This facility will 
need to be equipped with appropriate medical 
and nursing care services due to the specific 
requirements of these patients and will 
necessitate a higher budget. We are dedicated 
to addressing this need in the near future."
