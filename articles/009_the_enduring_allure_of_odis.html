T
he 1996 World Cup was a watershed in the history of ODI Cricket. 
It unearthed the commercial potential hidden in the Indian 
subcontinent for the game, coinciding with the rise of a cricketing 
superstar, Sachin Tendulkar. The on-field exploits of Sri Lanka, 
resulting in a rag-to-riches type of rise, constructing an underdog fairy 
tale was just the perfect ending. The ODI format was the new trend. It 
was here to stay.
Fast forward 27 years later, as the tournament returned to India, 
everything had changed. India was an undisputed superpower; cricket 
was being played in a manner that was previously unimaginable. 
Money was being made in a different format, casting a significant 
question mark over the future of ODI cricket. The scarce crowd 
attendance at the opening game only strengthened these doubts.

Was the ODI format we fell in love with nearing its 
expiry?
As the World Cup 2023 culminated in style, thankfully, 
the doubts have been dismissed with disdain. Factors such 
as improved attendance, especially in major cricketing 
centres, stupendous performances, the rise of Afghanistan, 
the courage of the Dutch, and the utter dominance of the 
cricketing superpower, India, have indeed allowed the 
ICC to breathe easy about the future of the format. The 
phenomenal rise of India as a team with international 
dominance has made the format attractive to the beat of 
cricket's commercial survival.
Undoubtedly, many kids want to emulate feats such as 
Kohli reaching the pinnacle of ODI achievements in front 
of Sachin or Shami bowling a spell of dreams in a game that 
counts the most, like in the semis. These are the dreams 
that ensure the longevity of formats. It's hard to imagine 
the same being said of T20 leagues. Who would know who 
has the most number of T20 centuries, and does it count? 
Does Herath's magical spell in 2014 against the Kiwis carry 
the same weight as Shami's seven-wicket show? Perhaps not 
simply because this format and the World Cup has its own 
aura.
Beyond those factors, this tournament has shown us the 
real value of the format. While Tests and T20Is have their 
own value offering, ODIs are an eclectic mix of both, with 
an additional skill set requirement.
The Kohli-Rahul partnership in Chennai against Australia 
serves as an example. Survival of probing spells, followed by 
consolidation, culminating with sheer dominance. A mix of 
phases catering to generations of cricket lovers.
The Maxwell masterclass in Mumbai was a different dish 
altogether. The strenuous test on fitness coupled with 
insane skill requirements to accomplish the impossible 
was an act that could be seen only in ODIs. Kiwi Darrel 
Mitchell wasn't far behind. Having fielded 50 overs in the 
sultry Mumbai weather, the fitness levels he had to show to 
score a century, which for a while threatened the host, was 
a feat to cherish, again rare to be required in a T20. While 
Tests examine the endurance and T20Is test the tempo, this 
situation tested both in a way other formats could never 
examine.
Also, the beauty of this format lies in the approach a 
team takes. In T20Is, it's slam-bang mostly. But here, one 
of the key success factors for India was the Rohit-Kohli 
synchrony. Rohit went hell for leather at the top, playing 
selfless knocks, dwarfed in quantum but massive in impact. 
Kohli dropped anchor, batted deep, and scored truckloads 
of runs, depicting insane fitness levels in order for the 
likes of Shreyas and Rahul to go ballistic. The multitude of 
approaches in order to succeed in itself is a beauty found 
nowhere else.
While the above showcased the various facets of skills 
tested, the phenomenal rise of Afghanistan and the 
consistency of the Dutch punching above their weight 
showed how much potential there is to increase the 
competitive nature of the ODI cricketing landscape. The re-
emergence of the Proteas and Aussies showing their mettle 
when pushed against the wall were features that reiterated 
the intrigue that lies within this format, at times even 
nurturing nostalgia amongst fans.</p>

Dr. Aravinthan Arunthavanathan is a versatile professional, excelling in both medicine and cricket 
writing. A graduate of Colombo Medical Faculty, he now plays a vital role in the pharmaceutical 
industry, focusing on areas such as Medical Marketing and New Business Development. Additionally, 
he's a celebrated cricket writer in Sri Lanka, known for his analyses on his Twitter, @Cricket_decoded. 
He is also a skilled public speaker with interests in cognitive sciences and education in medical and 
management fields. His unique combination of scientific expertise, sports analysis, and communication 
skills has made him a notable figure in both medical and sports circles.
While the initial part of the tournament seemed dull due 
to the lack of impact or context of individual results, the 
latter part more than made up for it with close results, 
upsets, and semi-final berths remaining numerically open 
till the last Super Saturday. The host nation showcasing 
their mighty ODI muscle, challenging the rest to take 
their games to the next level to even come close, was 
an additional development that is sure to ignite fire in 
the bellies of other major nations to reclaim lost pride 
and bragging rights. Australia's resurgence serves as a 
prime example. After suffering two losses, the Aussies felt 
overwhelmed, doubting their ability to break through what 
seemed like a one-sided dominance against them. However, 
they turned the tables, winning all subsequent matches and 
ultimately triumphing over India in the final on November 
19th. 
In this context, if the ICC makes the necessary moves and 
ensures the broken systems of nations with rich cricketing 
history in Sri Lanka, West Indies, and Zimbabwe are put 
together while developing the Netherlands and Afghanistan 
further, the next World Cup, with a refined, concise format, 
can be a ripper in the rainbow nation. In the interim, a 
streamlined ODI league with meaning added for each game 
with a qualification path for the 2027 edition would ensure 
the lucrativeness of the format and keep the crowd engaged.
The T20s may be money-spinning and more attractive, but 
none of these leagues would make a man with a broken 
finger come back to lead from the front like Williamson did 
for the Kiwis or inspire him to achieve feats like Maxwell 
with cramps all over the body redefining human willpower. 
That's the aura of an ODI World Cup, and that cannot be 
replicated by any other format.
This edition of the World Cup has proven it remains the 
pinnacle event of cricket, and despite the T20 leagues, its 
aura and allure remain unmatched. To keep that alive, ODIs 
just need context, and if the administrators do that, the 
format will surely keep thriving.
As a fan who fell in love with the game in 95/96, one 
couldn't have asked for a better celebration of cricket than 
the one that just concluded. One can hope that, like the 
96 edition, this edition too would have made many from 
younger generations fall in love with this beautiful game.</p>
