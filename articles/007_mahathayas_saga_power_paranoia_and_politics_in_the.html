Engineer and the Tragic Plight of 
Punitham Akka
Another person central to Mahathaya's 
story's brutal nexus was Manickavasagar 
Mahendraraja, also known as 'Engineer.' A 
talented mechanic from Punnalaikadduvan, 
he was well-known in the region and once 
owned a mechanic shop at the north junction 
of Punnalaikadduvan. Coming from a 
family of mechanics, with many relatives in 
the same profession, his skill as a mechanic 
and proficiency as a driver earned him the 
nickname 'Engineer.' 
Punnalai Kadduvan, a small village, was once 
known as a haven for the LTTE. Following 
the assassination of Alfred Thuraiappa, it 
is believed that Prabhakaran sought refuge 
here to evade arrest. Notably, this area was 
the origin of prominent early LTTE members 
Ragavan and Iyer. From its inception, the 
LTTE had a substantial network in this area.
Engineer comes from a family with a strong 
background in mechanics, many of whom are 
in the same profession. His uncle, Mechanic 
Bala, was a tragic figure in this context. In 
1983, Bala was killed by the LTTE, who 
mistakenly believed he was a spy for the Sri 
Lankan army.
The circumstances surrounding Bala's alleged 
betrayal are subject to varying accounts. Some 
claim he was mistakenly suspected of leaking 
information about early LTTE members 
Ragavan and Ganeshan (Iyer) to the Sri 
Lankan army, leading to his elimination by the 
LTTE. Others suggest that the LTTE wrongly 
identified him as the informant who disclosed 
details about 'Avro' Kulam, an early associate 
of Velupillai Prabhakaran. 'Avro' Kulam 
became notorious for his alleged involvement 
in the Air Ceylon bombing at Ratmalana in 
September 1978.
Despite the tragedy of Bala's death, several 
members of his family, including his son 
Arivu, joined the LTTE. Arivu himself suffered 
a significant injury in battle, losing a leg. He 
now resides in Switzerland. Furthermore, 
reliable sources within the LTTE revealed to 
the Jaffna Monitor that Prabhakaran and top 
LTTE leaders subsequently expressed regret 
for the wrongful execution of Mechanic Bala, 
acknowledging his innocence.

Engineer, a close ally of 
Mahathaya, began his 
association as Mahathaya's 
driver and eventually became 
a trusted confidant. According 
to a source who spent ten 
days with Mahathaya in 
Jaffna, Mahathaya had two 
close associates in the region: 
Engineer and Nishanthan 
(Kumaravelu Vignarajah) from 
Achchuveli. Nishanthan, an 
infamous spy who infiltrated 
the ranks of the LTTE on 
behalf of the Sri Lankan 
army, provided meticulous 
details about the 1985 attack 
on Pandithar (Sinnathurai 
Raveenthiran), the then Jaffna 
district commander of the 
LTTE before Kittu took charge. 
The story of Nishanthan and his 
betrayal warrants a dedicated 
chapter in this series.
Engineer's younger brother, 
Lt. Vasan (Manikkavasakar 
Kuvinthirarasa), joined the 
LTTE in the 1982/83 period. 
He played a leading role in the 
Jaffna Fort attack. Tragically, he 
died on May 21, 1985, during

a roundup by the Sri Lankan Army in the 
Kurunagar area of Jaffna.
One of our sources, closely associated with 
Engineer in the LTTE, described him as self-
aggrandizing and self-promoting, noticeably 
deficient in significant self-discipline. Unlike 
other LTTE members, who frequently shaved 
their beards and maintained a neat and clean 
appearance, Engineer lacked these qualities. 
Our source noted that he often did not shave 
and did not wear neat and tidy clothes like 
other LTTE members.
This source also observed that Engineer, a 
short, slightly overweight, and somewhat

older-looking man, often spoke impulsively 
and with overconfidence, frequently 
overstating his qualifications. Furthermore, 
our source mentioned that Engineer was 
one of the chief, albeit informal, advisors to 
Mahathaya. However, our source believes that 
Engineer lacked the essential qualities to fulfil 
an advisory role, yet Mahathaya frequently 
sought his advice. According to our source, 
this situation not only highlights Engineer's 
overreach within Mahathaya's faction but also 
raises questions about Mahathaya's judgment 
in selecting his close allies.
Engineer sustained a severe injury in an 
operation at Tellippalai, leading to the loss 
of a leg. To acquire a prosthetic limb, the 
Jaipur foot, he travelled to India by country 
boat. Following Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, 
Engineer was arrested and imprisoned in 
India. Few Reports indicate that during 
his incarceration, he was approached and 
eventually convinced by the Indian intelligence 
wing to work for them. 
One day, Engineer unexpectedly reappeared 
in Jaffna. He had entered Sri Lanka via 
Katunayake Airport and subsequently travelled 
by road to Jaffna. His unimpeded journey 
raised suspicions with Pottu Amman, the ever-
paranoid LTTE intelligence wing chief. Pottu 
Amman speculated that Engineer, a senior 
LTTE member distinguishable by his Jaipur 
foot, could not have successfully travelled 
through the high-security zones of Katunayake 
Airport, Colombo, and Vavuniya without 
arousing any suspicion. Consequently, under 
the directive of Pottu Amman, the LTTE's 
intelligence wing arrested him.
There are two differing theories about 
Engineer. One group of former high-ranking 
LTTE officers, who spoke with the Jaffna 
Monitor, believes that Engineer was indeed a 
mole for RAW (Research and Analysis Wing, 
India's foreign intelligence agency). However, 
another faction of former LTTE leaders holds 
the opposite view, denying that he was a mole.
Those who believe Engineer was a RAW mole 
are divided into two subsets. The first group 
contends that he returned to Sri Lanka from 
India with critical coup information from 
RAW. This information allegedly involved 
Prabhakaran with his deputy Mahathaya.<br />
Seelan (Charles Lucas Anthony)</p>

a plan to eliminate Prabhakaran and 
install Mahathaya as the LTTE leader, a 
plot which Engineer supposedly relayed 
to Mahathaya, implicating him in the 
conspiracy.
In contrast, the second set of sources, who 
also believe Engineer was a RAW mole, 
disputes this claim. They assert that while 
Engineer did become a RAW informant, 
he neither disclosed RAW's agenda to 
Mahathaya nor was Mahathaya agreeable 
to any plan proposed by RAW.
Another set of sources assert that Engineer 
was not a mole for RAW. Supporting this 
view is a former prominent LTTE member 
who wishes to remain unnamed and 
maintains that it was feasible for LTTE 
members to travel by flight via Katunayake 
Airport and safely reach their destinations. 
To illustrate, he refers to an incident from 
1982 involving Seelan (Charles Lucas 
Anthony), the then-military chief of the 
LTTE.
Seelan accidentally shot himself in the 
chest while handling a gun in the presence 
of Nirmala and Nithiyanathan, who were 
LTTE supporters at the time. Gravely 
injured, Seelan urgently required medical 
attention. Nithiyanathan successfully 
transported Seelan to India through 
Katunayake Airport despite his severe 
chest wound.
Furthermore, this source argues that 
Engineer was not a widely recognized 
figure and did not appear to be a typical 
fighter. He mentioned that Engineer 
looked more mature to be a fighter and 
could have traveled through the airport to 
LTTE-controlled areas without arousing 
suspicion. This viewpoint challenges 
Punitham Akka</p>

the idea that Engineer was a RAW mole, 
suggesting that his passage through high-
security zones might not have been as 
extraordinary or suspicious as Pottu Amman 
perceived.
Punitham Akka
Engineer's mother, Punithavathi 
(Manickavasagar Punithavathi), was a beloved 
figure in and around Punnai Kattuvan, 
affectionately known as 'Punitham Akka' 
and 'Punitham Amma'. To many, she was 
'tPuj;jha;' (meaning 'Brave Mother'), a term of 
deep respect and love used by everyone from 
Prabhakaran to the regular LTTE cadres. She 
wasn't just an early supporter of the LTTE; 
she was a maternal figure who opened her 
heart and home to the fighters, treating them 
as her own children. This profound care and 
compassion earned her their unwavering 
reverence and love, making her a true symbol 
of strength and nurturing in their eyes.
Her home was a sanctuary for the LTTE, 
always open and welcoming to fighters and 
supporters. In a heartfelt account to the Jaffna 
Monitor, one former LTTE leader shared how 
her house served as a refuge, a safe haven 
available around the clock. He fondly recalled 
arriving at her home with his fighters in the 
dead of night. Without hesitation, Punitham 
Akka would begin preparing puttu and a 
special Jaffna-style omelette. The distinctive 
aroma of her omelette, made with gingelly oil, 
remains etched in his memory, evoking deep 
feelings of warmth, comfort, and a profound 
sense of home.
Yet, as he reminisces, these warm memories 
are also tinged with immense guilt. He cannot 
forget the many unpleasant things that befell 
her after her son's arrest. Despite being a 
senior member of the LTTE, he had to witness 
all these events in silence, unable to raise his 
voice, like a mute spectator. The love and care 
she showed them came at a great personal cost, 
and this bittersweet realization haunts him, 
casting a shadow over the fond memories of 
her unwavering hospitality and kindness.
Another former high-level officer of the LTTE 
disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor that upon 
Prabhakaran's return from India to Sri Lanka 
at the beginning of 1987, one of his first visits 
was to Punitham Akka's house. This highlights 
the deep affection Prabhakaran had for her. 
During this visit, he said that Prabhakaran 
took photos with her, as well as with the 
mother of another loyal supporter, Thadi 
(Beard) Mohan Mama. All these individuals 
hailed from Punnalaikadduvan, a village that 
had provided crucial support to Prabhakaran 
when he most needed it.
It's vital to recall that on July 23, 1983, the 
LTTE orchestrated an ambush on the Four 
Four Bravo patrol, an event that precipitated 
the Thirunelveli massacre and the Black July 
riots, signaling the start of the Sri Lankan Civil 
War. Following this, Prabhakaran fled to India 
and remained there for over three years before 
returning to Sri Lanka in early 1987.
A high-level LTTE source revealed to 
the Jaffna Monitor that when top LTTE 
commanders, including Pulenthi Amman 
(then the Trincomalee commander of the 
LTTE), visited Jaffna, they would often stay at 
Punitham Akka's house. He described how, 
during that tumultuous time, the atmosphere 
in Jaffna was largely supportive of the LTTE 
and other militant groups. However, Punitham 
Akka stood out not just for her words of 
encouragement but for her fearless actions.
He emphasized, "At that time, when we were 
fighting against the Sinhalese chauvinistic</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

government, what we needed was action, not 
words. Punitham Akka gave us that." Her 
home became a haven, her courage a beacon. 
She didn't just speak of support; she embodied 
it, risking everything for the cause she believed 
in. This unwavering dedication and tangible 
support earned her the profound respect and 
admiration of the LTTE commanders. Her 
bravery and selflessness left an indelible mark 
on those who fought alongside her, making her 
a true heroine in their eyes.
Even after many years, these LTTE leaders and 
fighters exude the same sentiment towards 
Punitham Akka. In our conversations with 
former LTTE fighters and leaders, we at the 
Jaffna Monitor can still feel and understand 
the deep respect and admiration they hold for 
her. She was one of the very few women who 
personally visited the Tigers' sentries, bringing 
not just food and tea, but warmth and comfort. 
Our source emphasized that she didn't just 
offer food; she prepared delicious meals 
infused with a mother's care and love.
During the tense period of the Indian Peace 
Keeping Force (IPKF), when Prabhakaran 
retreated to the secluded Niththikaikulam in 
the Mulaitivu district, Punitham Akka braved 
the dangers to visit him. She was among the 
very few who reached this secretive location, 
staying by his side, even in the darkest times. 
Her presence brought a sense of home and 
hope to the fighters who were secluded in the 
Niththikaikulam forest, a former LTTE fighter 
who was present at Niththikaikulam told the 
Jaffna Monitor.
Another source revealed that she even nursed 
Prabhakaran's children, Charles Antony and 
Thuvaraga, though yet another source contests 
this claim. However, both sources agreed in 
their conversation with the Jaffna Monitor 
that Punitham Akka took care of Mahathaya's 
children.
Another former LTTE leader relayed to the 
Jaffna Monitor that in 1986, Mahathaya 
founded an orphanage in the Manipai area of 
Jaffna, close to the Velakkai Pillaiyar Temple. 
He appointed Punitham Akka to oversee the 
orphanage, which provided shelter to around 
25-30 young girls. Her care for these girls went 
beyond mere duty; she treated each child with 
deep maternal affection as if they were her 
own.
This former LTTE leader told the Jaffna 
Monitor that Punitham Akka's nurturing spirit 
transformed the orphanage into a sanctuary 
of love and security. Each girl found a mother 
in her, feeling cherished and protected amidst 
the chaos of their surroundings. Credible 
sources say that this orphanage later became 
the precursor to Prabhakaran's dream project, 
Sencholai, where the LTTE supremo cared for 
and nurtured hundreds of war orphans. It is 
said to be the project closest to his heart.
Even today, many women who grew up in the 
orphanage hold Punitham Akka in the highest 
regard, cherishing her as their Godmother. Her 
legacy of compassion, strength, and maternal 
love continues to resonate deeply within the 
hearts of these women, some of whom the 
Jaffna Monitor has had the opportunity to 
meet and talk with. These women fondly 
recall the warmth and care they received, 
often describing Punitham Akka as a guiding

After her son Engineer's arrest by the LTTE, 
Punitham Akka's revered status as the 'Brave 
Mother' began to wane. Locals and villagers</p>

grew hesitant and afraid to interact with her 
or her family. Desperate for her son's release, 
she visited every LTTE camp, pleading with 
the leaders. She begged and cried before every 
LTTE leader who had once eaten from her 
hands, imploring them for her son's release 
or at least a chance to see him. She waited in 
front of the camps for days and nights, hoping 
for a glimpse of her son. Despite her persistent 
efforts, the LTTE leadership refused her pleas. 
She spent years waiting outside the LTTE 
camps, clinging to the hope of being reunited 
with her son.
The fighters inside the camp recounted 
harrowing accounts of her waiting for hours 
in the scorching sun, hoping for an update 
about her son. One of the fighters, who had 
once enjoyed her soulful meals, expressed his 
regret to the Jaffna Monitor. He said, "At that 
time itself, I felt sad and guilty, but you know, 
in the LTTE's structure, you should listen to 
our leadership even if our conscience says it's 
wrong."
A former LTTE leader drew a poignant parallel 
between Punitham Akka's situation, waiting 
outside the LTTE camp for her son's release, 
and that of Tamil mothers who waited in front 
of army camps for the release of their children. 
This former LTTE leader admitted to the Jaffna 
Monitor, with a sense of regret, that their 
organization's behaviour was, in this respect, 
similar to that of the Sri Lankan army.
The fate of Engineer remains unknown to this 
day. It is widely believed that he was executed 
by the LTTE. Some speculate that he may have 
died during interrogation due to brutal torture, 
but the truth remains a mystery.
A former LTTE leader, who once held a 
prominent position within the organization, 
confided to the Jaffna Monitor his belief 
in Engineer's innocence. He revealed 
that the LTTE's intelligence wing had 
arrested Brigadier Theepan (Velayuthapillai 
Baheerathakumar), a one-time close ally of 
Mahathaya who later became the commander 
of the Northern Front, and Colonel Jeyam, a 
notable LTTE leader famous for his integrity 
and bravery, in connection with the Mahathaya 
case. Both were subjected to unimaginable 
torture. Their toenails were removed by Pottu 
Amman's brutal torture team, who were 
highly motivated, believing they were dealing 
with traitors to Tamil Eelam and Annan 
(Prabhakaran).
Despite this, they were eventually released 
and proved their loyalty by fighting for the 
LTTE until their final days. Brigadier Theepan 
died fighting in the infamous Battle of 
Aanandapuram in Iranaipalai. Although the 
LTTE leadership ordered him to evacuate the 
war zone and move to the Mullivaikal area—
the last area that remained for the LTTE—

Theepan refused to leave his fighters and died 
on April 4. Similarly, Colonel Jeyam died on 
May 17.
Our source pointed out that Theepan and 
Jeyam might have been eliminated if they 
had not written a secret letter to Prabhakaran 
through his bodyguard, declaring their 
innocence and affirming their unwavering 
loyalty to Annan (Prabhakaran). Moved 
by their plea, Prabhakaran formed a new 
investigative team that eventually found them 
innocent.
Our sources say that while Theepan and Jeyam 
were found innocent and released, hundreds 
of innocent LTTE fighters who had taken up 
arms for the Tamil cause were not so lucky. 
They ended up being killed due to the paranoia 
and political maneuvers of the LTTE's 
intelligence wing chief, Pottu Amman.
He also shared a gripping story about a fighter 
who had been captured and brutally tortured 
by the LTTE's intelligence wing. After his 
release, this fighter reportedly confronted 
Pottu Amman, saying, "You suspected that we 
were ensnared in the web of Indian intelligence 
and acted as agents of RAW. But, in reality, it is 
you who are caught in their trap and acted as 
the RAW agent."
His close friend, a former LTTE fighter from 
Mahathaya's faction, later expanded on this 
topic in a conversation with the Jaffna Monitor. 
He explained that RAW intended to incite self-
destruction within the LTTE through internal 
conflicts. He elaborated that Pottu Amman, 
entangled in this brutal nexus, inadvertently 
advanced RAW's objective. By killing 
hundreds of fighters under the suspicion that 
they were RAW agents, Pottu Amman, in 
effect, significantly aided RAW's strategy to 
destabilize the LTTE from within.
While sharing his views, similar to many 
former LTTE fighters and leaders, he 
used strong, unparliamentary language to 
describe Pottu Amman and his handling of 
Mahathaya's case. However, he also shared a 
sentiment common among many ex-LTTE 
members regarding Prabhakaran, saying, 
'mz;zd; ghyk; mtUf;F nghl;ldpz;l 
tpisahl;Lfs; njupahJ,' which translates 
to 'Poor Annan (Prabhakaran). He doesn't 
know the games of Pottu Amman.' This 
reflects a sense of empathy for Prabhakaran, 
suggesting a belief that he was unaware of 
the manipulative tactics employed by Pottu 
Amman.
Another LTTE leader who held a prominent 
position shared a perspective with us that 
resonated with a section of former LTTE 
fighters. "Annan (Prabhakaran) was considered 
the de facto god," he said. "There was a belief 
that even a dog couldn't go to shit in the 
LTTE-held area without Annan's knowledge. 
So how, then," he argued, "did these many 
killings happen in the name of destroying 
traitors without Annan knowing? How could 
Pottu Amman alone orchestrate these many 
killings? This is rubbish."
He continued, "While, of course, Pottan 
(Pottu Amman) played his own manipulative 
games, it's compulsory to acknowledge the 
painful truth. While I still respect Annan 
(Prabhakaran) immensely, this whole mess—
Annan bears a large part of the responsibility. 
Annan's paranoia and his philosophy of 'kill 
the person who even thought of killing you in 
their dreams' ignited this whole mess. He can't 
just escape blame," he concluded.
Punitham Akka passed away in March 2021, 
all alone. She had given birth to five children, 
but none were by her side when she took her</p>
