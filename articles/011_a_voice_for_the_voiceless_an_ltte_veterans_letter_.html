Dear Karuna, 
Addressing the Struggles of Our Eastern Comrades
I recently read your interview in the Jaffna Monitor and felt compelled to 
write this letter to share my reflections. I remember our first meeting in 
Chennai when you were a young and ambitious fighter, taking up arms 
against the Sinhalese chauvinistic government. Those days in Chennai 
gave me valuable insights into your abilities and potential as a future 
leader.
I also oppose the systematically created propaganda that labels northern 
fighters of the LTTE as martyrs while those who were with you during 
your split from the LTTE are branded as traitors. I do not subscribe to 
this view. The eastern fighters under your command made significant 
sacrifices for the Tamil cause. This is a point I am prepared to defend 
vigorously, backed by data, against anyone who challenges it.
I still remember it as if it were yesterday. A team of 16 young fighters, 
including yourself, was initially assembled in Chennai. They were notable 
for their relatively small stature and the apparent need for significant 
physical development. This group was then dispatched to Pondicherry 
under the leadership of Shanthosam's master. Our organization arranged 
for their accommodation in a rented house.
These young fighters underwent rigorous physical training and adhered 
to strict discipline. In addition to physical conditioning, educational 
sessions were conducted, which covered a range of topics, including 
Tamil history, politics, and military strategy.
Among them, you, Karuna Amman, were particularly notable. My 
several encounters with you in Pondicherry allowed me to witness your 
capabilities firsthand. Shanthosam Master, a close acquaintance of mine, 
often spoke highly of your potential for leadership. Having observed

your conduct and skills myself, I also came to 
recognize the inherent leadership qualities that 
were evident even in your youth.
You 
distinguished 
yourself 
significantly 
among the 16 fighters. Notable for your soft-
spoken demeanour and keen observational 
skills, you excelled in listening and displayed 
an admirable work ethic during physical 
training, often surpassing your peers in effort 
and self-discipline. Shanthosam Master rapidly 
developed a profound respect and admiration 
for you.
During the third training batch, I noticed 
several distinctive qualities in you. After 
completing the training camp, you were 
directly selected for an intelligence group 
under our leader, Prabhakaran. One particular 
incident, 
mistakenly 
attributed 
to 
our 
organization by Indian agencies, highlighted 
your sharp intelligence and adept handling 
skills. Impressively, you managed to identify 
the actual perpetrator behind the incident. 
However, I choose not to go into further details 
about this specific event. 
Under your leadership in the Eastern region, 
our organization saw significant advancements, 
especially in the areas of recruitment and tactical 
operations. However, I must confess that I have 
always been heartbroken and firmly opposed 
to forced enlistment practices. Your leadership 
represented a considerable improvement over 
the efforts of previous commanders from the 
Batticaloa and Ampara districts, like Aruna, 
Kumarappa, and Pottu Amman. The strategic 
initiatives and their execution that you 
introduced played a crucial role in fortifying 
the LTTE's stance in this region.
During the 2002-2003 period, I witnessed a 
concerning situation within our movement, 
particularly involving Thamilenthi, the head of 
the financial wing. It became increasingly clear 
that Thamilenthi was orchestrating a strategy 
that placed you in a precarious position. He 
sent a representative to Batticaloa, mandating 
the redirection of all funds collected in the 
Eastern region to the central financial wing. 
Your resistance to this directive, in my view, 
signalled the beginning of your discord with 
our leadership.
Additionally, I came to learn that Thamilenthi 
was participating in negative conversations 
about you with our leader, Prabhakaran. This 
revelation was both shocking and disheartening 
to me. It was evident that our organization was 
at risk of losing a highly skilled military leader 
such as yourself, primarily due to Thamilenthi's 
misguided actions. This already tense situation 
was exacerbated by Pottu Amman, the chief of 
the LTTE's intelligence wing, whose systematic 
actions to corner you only served to escalate 
the conflict, akin to pouring oil on a raging fire.
In the 1990s, I had firsthand experience with 
the challenges that Eastern fighters faced, 
particularly regarding access to nutritious food, 
an issue that persisted for an extended period. 
During my three-month deployment in the 
Paduvankarai region, other Eastern fighters and 
I directly encountered these hardships. Our diet 
was limited to beef seasoned solely with salt, 
with no variety. Consequently, many fighters 
suffered from severe weight loss and diarrhoea. 
The financial wing of our organization, led 
by Thamilenthi, was responsible for this dire 
situation due to its failure to allocate adequate 
funding to the Eastern region for essential 
supplies.
However, during the peace period, even 
though I was not directly with you at that 
time, I observed a notable change. It was only 
then that the Eastern fighters could finally 
enjoy a variety of foods and have nutritious,</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

44
satisfying meals after a long duration of 
deprivation. Remarkably, this improvement in 
living conditions was managed solely with the 
resources generated within the Eastern region 
itself.
In light of these circumstances, Thamilenthi's 
directive to channel all funds collected in the 
Eastern region to the central financial wing was 
quite unjust. This decision seemed to disregard 
the unique and pressing needs of the Eastern 
fighters, who had already endured considerable 
hardships due to previous financial neglect.
Many fighters who joined the movement under 
your leadership were summoned to Vanni to 
participate in battles in the Northern regions. 
Tragically, numerous of these fighters met 
heroic deaths, and their remains now rest in 
cemeteries at locations like Theraavil Thuyilum 
Illam.
Furthermore, a significant number of Eastern 
fighters sustained injuries in these Northern 
conflicts, leading to partial or complete 
disability. A substantial proportion of these 
disabled Eastern fighters currently reside in 
the Vanni region. Despite the influx of funds 
during the LTTE's peak, the living conditions 
provided for these injured Eastern fighters in 
Vanni were, and continue to be, substandard.
For instance, in places like Valluvarpuram, where 
many Eastern fighters were accommodated, 
the conditions were critical. The area lacked 
proper roads, drinking water, and sanitation 
facilities. Additionally, job opportunities for 
these individuals are extremely limited. As 
I now reside overseas, my ability to assist is 
constrained to supporting only a few with 
my personal income. However, I believe 
the responsibility to aid in their livelihood 
predominantly rests on your shoulders.
Organizations 
operating 
overseas 
often 
overlook the fighters from Batticaloa and 
Ampara as they continue to perceive them 
through the outdated lens associated with 
the Karuna group. Consequently, I urge you 
to demonstrate compassion towards these 
fighters from Batticaloa and Ampara residing 
in Vanni. Fulfilling this responsibility is a moral 
imperative and a duty that falls upon you.
Support for the fighters from the East is 
unfortunately limited, with many needing more 
willingness to provide assistance. Additionally, 
there exists a reluctance among potential 
helpers, driven by a fear of being labelled as 
traitors. Despite these challenges, Lucas, the 
brother of Nadesan, former political Head of 
the Liberation Tigers, took a few initiatives to 
aid the Eastern fighters. Utilizing the funds 
allocated by the Liberation Tigers during the 
peace period, he extended significant support. 
However, with these funds now depleted, his 
assistance has ceased.
In light of this situation, your involvement, 
Karuna, becomes imperative. With your 
capabilities and the connections you have 
established with the government, it is within 
your power to significantly aid these former 
fighters. Your support in these challenging 
times would be invaluable and a testament to 
your commitment to the welfare of those who 
once stood alongside you. Fought for your 
commands and died on your commands.

Story
“
Speed it up a little,” said Namacivāyam. His wife 
Pārvathi ran inside to find someone else who could do 
the ālatti with her.
Rāghavaṉ clasped Sānthiṉi’s hand. It was as if he wanted 
to wrap his hand around her slender flower-like hand to 
announce to the whole world that she was now his.
Procession

short story ūrvalam (Ch;tyk;) from

Sānthiṉi’s fingers 
didn’t speak to 
his. There was no 
liveliness nor emotion 
in them.
For whatever reason, 
she stood there like an 
emotionless piece of 
wood.
Amidst the waves 
of humanity, that 
colorful car, decorated 
like a swan, was 
crawling slowly. It was 
beautiful, very like a 
swimming swan.
Sānthiṉi gently 
cast her eyes to the 
right. Rāghavaṉ’s 
appearance was 
delightful. He looked 
very handsome in his 
silk vetti salvai, just 
as she had imagined. 
Although the gold 
kadukkaṉ that glittered 
in his ear made her 
giggle a little, she 
really liked how he 
looked.
She couldn’t really 
see him earlier at the 
maṇavaṟai through all 
that smoke rising from 
the ritual ōmam fire.
Nevertheless, 
somehow, she was not 
exactly bubbling with 
excitement. Now she 
felt like she could have 
done without the very procession 
that she had been looking forward 
to so eagerly.
Even the morning before she 
was racked with worry. She was 
dreaming about all the different 
ways as to how she should walk 
or sit next to her husband!
The groom got into the car and 
sat down.
Sānthiṉi, too, got in and sat down 
next to him, barely touching him.
Following them, as is customary, 
all the village tots crowded into 
the car asserting their rights for 
equal treatment with the bride 
and groom. Namacivāyam 
had such a difficult time, my 
goodness! They were little devils, 
not little children.
Somehow, with the grace of 
God, the newlyweds began the 
procession, struggling to breath 
amidst being crushed all around.
The driver proudly stepped 
on the gas pedal. The gigantic 
procession started inching 
forward.
Here comes the first corner. 
This is the house of Kamalā; 
Sānthiṉi’s best friend.
Sānthiṉi’s eyes lifted up gently 
and scanned the row of poṭṭus 
along the fence, those little 
openings meant for people to take 
a shortcut through the fence. That 
was where Kamalā would be 
waiting. Doesn’t it take a thief to 
know one? Sānthiṉi’s eyes shone 
momentarily.</p>

But then they went back to the same lifeless 
stare.
At the university, Sānthiṉi thought Rāghavaṉ 
was just a friend. She didn’t at all expect that 
their friendship would blossom into romance 
leading to marriage.
More than Rāghavaṉ himself, she loved his 
intellect. But now Rāghavaṉ himself is hers 
— her property.
The sound of laughter. Sānthiṉi lifted her 
head slightly. Maṇiyaṇṇai was teasing them. 
But her gaze drifted to the peepul tree ahead. 
The same peepul tree. Then there was only a 
lone statue of the elephant-headed deity who 
removes all obstacles, Piḷḷaiyār, under the 
tree, not a small temple like there is now.
At this very temple, ten years ago, she and her 
cousin Māṇikkam had played house. Now —.
“Chee! What a thought? It was just silly 
children’s play a long time ago. It shouldn’t 
…”</p>

“What? Children’s play? Why? Even two 
years ago, when you came home for vacation 
from the university, your cousin, that postman 
cousin, came to see you.”
“When he stood apart as though there was 
no connection between him and you, you 
dragged him into a conversation!”
“Why are you silent? Just because I went 
away to study, does it mean I have forgotten 
you?”
You did say “call me 'Santha’ just like in the 
old times. I won’t like it at all if you start 
behaving differently with me.” Was that 
stupidity or what?
“Santhi, how long does the groom have to 
wait for you to get out of the car? You are 
drifting along in some dream world!”
Sānthiṉi jolted herself out of her reverie and 
got out of the car. Rāghavaṉ glanced at her 
out of the corner of his eye and smiled.</p>

She beseeched the same peepul tree Pillaiyar 
to bless her with a strong marriage.
Untypically she kept thinking of her cousin. 
Why have such thoughts when her loving 
husband, her husband who shares her joys and 
her sorrows, was right next to her?
She pushed that thought away.
They walked around the Peepul tree.
As she circled the sacred tree, she resolved 
never to give into the same thought again.
But her resolve was tested right away.
When she turned the third corner of the 
peepul tree, her blood froze.
On the base of that peepul tree, which was 
illuminated in patches by the gas light, the 
letters “Māṇikkam - Sānthiṉi” came into view 
clearly.
She read the letters. She felt as if her body 
was falling apart. Her hands were shaking. 
She pressed her chest hard.
She remembered that incident. Māṇikkam had 
carved only his name and came running to 
drag Sānthiṉi to the tree to show her.
When she saw the letters “Māṇikkam,” she 
had started crying, demanding that her name 
should be carved right next to it. But as soon 
as the letter “Sā” was carved, his pocketknife 
broke.
My goodness! She had thrown a fit. Unable to 
withstand her nagging, Māṇikkam somehow 
procured another knife and carved the 
remaining letters.
What joy did she feel then!
`Chee! Do I have even a hundredth of the 
gratitude that this peepul tree is displaying? It 
is still faithfully showing every letter that was 
carved so long ago. What can be said about 
the words that were uttered that day … …’
'My God, my god, the same thought, again 
and again?’ … …
Something plopped down on her back. 
Startled, Sānthiṉi was turned to look. The 
gang of tots in the car had started to fall 
asleep. It was Raviyan who had fallen on her.
Rāghavaṉ laughed, asking “did you get 
scared?” Does a bride respond verbally? She 
used this as an excuse to cast her eyes down.
The car stopped at the junction. It was a major 
junction. Would the procession command 
respect if they didn’t stop at this junction to 
deliver an excellent “performance”? Maṇiyam 
aṇṇai made sure every single thing that 
Sānthiṉi had requested the other day was 
carried out to perfection.
But did Sānthiṉi really need all that now?
First the traditional wind instrument 
nādhaswaram started to explore the rāgas.
The nāttaikuṟiñji rāgam came piercing 
through the stem of the nādhaswaram. How 
did this rāga acquire such a sense of sadness? 
The player is squeezing all the world’s 
sadness through his instrument.
After all, should he really play such 
heartrending music just at this instant?
She turned to her husband. But he was very 
quietly enjoying the music with joy.
Her heart missed a beat.</p>

Do we diverge even in this little matter?
“Let us finish with the thavil quickly. It is 
going to be eleven soon,” Maṇiyam aṇṇai 
said.
She wanted to thank Maṇiyam aṇṇai 
profusely.
Sleepiness. Everyone walked a little faster. 
Sānthiṉi lifted her head gently to look at the 
sky. It looked like it might rain. Stars glittered 
here and there.
She wondered where the Arundhathi star was, 
the exemplary wife of the sage Vasishta who 
is pointed out to Hindu newlyweds. During 
the ceremony, when it came to the point 
where the priest had to point out Arundhathi 
to the couple, he had merely pointed to the 
roof.
“There comes my school at a distance. This is 
the path that Kamalā, Maṉōṉmaṇi, and I took 
to go to school, barely managing to lug our 
heavy school bags along. Is that sand dune 
still there? That was where my cousin and I 
used to sit side by side, doing sums, drawing,</p>

or playing house.”
“Can we play like that again?”
Suddenly her heart began to feel heavy. In that 
pitch darkness, her cousin’s form appeared 
before her. “Sānthiṉi! Ten years ago, when I 
lamented that I didn’t understand math, didn’t 
you wipe my tears with your tiny fingers and 
say ’I will teach you’? How many times did 
you try to teach me math? But nothing went 
into my brain.”
“Then you would hug me and say 'Aiyō! You 
are a dummy!’ Where did that love go?”
“What divides us today? Your B.A. degree.”
“Why would you remember this poor 
postman?”
What is this? This procession is turning onto 
maṇiyakkāra road? What? Is it really going 
that way?
Sānthiṉi’s heart sank.
When the procession turned the corner, she 
looked to see if the thatched roof and the 
broken gate came into view.
“Chee! Why is he standing there? He refused 
to come to the wedding. Did he want to 
see the grand sight of me walking in the 
procession in the middle of the night?
As the car passed the cottage, her heart 
fluttered. Unable to quell her curiosity, she 
turned to look. She froze to the core.
It was her cousin indeed, standing against 
the pillar, staring intently at her haughty self 
without self-awareness.
It passed in a moment.
Still, she thought she saw two tiny teardrops 
glittering in those eyes.
Suddenly, a cobra started to strangle 
Sānthiṉi’s neck. Startled, she looked down — 
no, it was just the garland she was wearing.
She bent her head downwards to hide the 
tears.
But Rāghavaṉ already noticed it: only the 
tears.
“Why! Sānthiṉi, is the gas light hurting your 
eyes? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” He 
chided her gently.
“Vēlu, take this lamp further away,” he 
commanded with the authority of the groom.
How much he loved her!
As the gas light moved away its buzzing 
increased.
She couldn’t bear that buzzing.
“Chee! What illusion is this? Where is this 
buzzing coming from?”
“Perhaps perhaps, is this is my cousin heaving 
a great sigh?”
She couldn’t even imagine.
Her heart felt heavy. She grasped her chest.
Her fingers felt something.
That was the brand new thāli that Rāghavaṉ 
had tied around her neck.</p>
