J
anaki is not the mastermind but acts 
as the central hub and chief organizer 
for former LTTE elements looking 
to stir unrest in Sri Lanka, a credible 
source revealed. While she coordinates 
operations from Chennai, the true 
masterminds behind the scenes are 
two high-ranking former LTTE figures: 
Sivarasa Pirunthapan, also known as 
Achchuthan/Suresh, a former LTTE Air 
Force pilot, and Pukalenthi Master, a 
key figure from the LTTE's Intelligence 
Wing. These two individuals are 
believed to be the real architects of the 
clandestine network, pulling the strings 
from abroad while Janaki manages on-
ground activities.

Pirunthapan, also known as 
Pirunthapan Rajah, Achchuthan, and

Suresh, was born on January 17, 1972 in Alaveddy, Jaffna. A 
former LTTE Air Force commander and pilot, he is an alumnus 
of Jaffna Hindu College (1988 O/L batch).
Achchuthan's connection to aviation runs deep—his 
grandfather served in the Royal Air Force in Malaysia during 
World War II, and his elder brother, Pathipan Sivarasa, holds 
a prominent role as a Senior Aerospace Engineer at General 
Dynamics Mission Systems – Canada. However, Pathipan is 
more than just an aerospace engineer—he is also a creative 
innovator.
Pathipan developed a specialized machine for making 
Idiyappam (string hoppers), a popular South Indian and Sri 
Lankan delicacy, and even secured a patent for the design.
The design registration details reveal that the machine was 
officially registered on April 4, 2011, following a priority filing 
in India on October 10, 2010, under OHIM (now known as the 
European Union Intellectual Property Office - EUIPO).
Sivarasa Pirunthapan's/ Achchuthan's listed address is 6A 
Rue Rognon, Saint-Pierre-d'Autils, La Chapelle-Longueville 
(Eure), and he holds French nationality. He has married Sakalya 
Sivarasa since October 4, 2004, in Kilinochchi, Sri Lanka.
Achchuthan pursued 
his initial flight training 
in France, using a 
cover story as a team 
leader at a restaurant 
in Disneyland Paris. 
He traveled extensively 
across Europe, Africa, 
Malaysia, Singapore, and 
the Far East to enhance his 
piloting skills and aviation 
knowledge. During one 
of these visits to the Far 
East, Achchuthan was 
reportedly arrested while 
carrying a substantial 
sum of money. However, 
he managed to escape by 
disguising himself as a 
businessman.
Credible LTTE sources 
informed Jaffna Monitor 
that Achchuthan provided 
combat flight training 
to LTTE suicide cadres. 
His technical expertise 
played a crucial role in 
preparing pilots for air 
suicide missions as early

commanders in 1998

he later named his 
daughter after this 
alias. His daughter, an 
accomplished archer 
and chess player, is a 
member of both the 
Dourdan Archery Club 
and the Pierre Perret 
Chess Club.
A credible source 
revealed that during 
the peace period, 
Ilangeswaran was 
sent abroad with two 
other LTTE operatives 
to study advanced 
technology. Renowned 
for his technical 
expertise, Ilangeswaran 
now leads what 
remains of the LTTE's 
cyber-attack team from 
France.
In early 2010, the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense reported that 
information regarding several international LTTE operatives 
was uncovered through diaries and notes found at the office of 
Castro, the former head of the LTTE's international wing, in 
Visvamadu. Documents seized during the investigation included 
records related to front organizations funding the LTTE and 
details about Tigers' ships and foreign trade operations. It was 
during this period that the name Sivarasa Pirunthapan, also 
known as Achchuthan or Suresh, gained prominence.
During the same period, Interpol issued a Red Notice for him 
on March 22, 2010 (Control No. A-1994/3-2010), signifying 
a request for international law enforcement to locate and 
provisionally arrest him, pending extradition or other legal 
action based on serious criminal investigations. His name was 
later added to the List of Designated Persons under paragraph 
4(2) of the United Nations Regulations No. 1 of 2012. He was 
officially listed on February 25, 2014, marking his inclusion in 
international monitoring for sanctions and restrictions.
A classic Vadivelu joke goes: 'ehd; NjLw khjpup NjLNwd;&gt; 
as 1998, including during 
the 2003–2004 ceasefire 
period.
Sources further disclosed 
that Achchuthan 
coordinated and 
commanded LTTE air 
raids on Colombo via 
satellite communication 
from an overseas base. 
Reports also indicate that 
Achchuthan controls 
multiple aviation-related 
assets abroad, bolstering 
the LTTE's operational 
capabilities and expanding 
its international reach.
After the assassination 
of Colonel Shankar—the 
LTTE air wing's leader—
on September 26, 2001, 
in a Claymore attack, 
Achchuthan briefly took 
over the leadership of the 
air wing, consolidating his 
authority and influence 
within the organization. 
Now, Achchuthan is 
responsible for funneling 
large sums of money to 
Janaki, enabling her to 
build and expand the 
network of former LTTE 
fighters across Sri Lanka.
Achchuthan operates 
alongside his brother, 
Sivarasa Langeswaran, 
a software professional 
who, according to sources, 
was formerly associated 
with the LTTE under the 
nom de guerre 'Barathy.'

eP xspAw khjpup xsp" (I pretend to search for you, and you 
pretend to hide). In a similar fashion, Achchuthan seems 
entirely unfazed by the Interpol red notice against him—and 
Interpol, for its part, appears satisfied that issuing the notice 
was more than enough.
Following the notice, Sivarasa Pirunthapan made a subtle shift 
in identity, rebranding himself as Pirunthapan Rajah. However, 
this nominal change did little to diminish his influence, and 
he remains a key figure at the helm of the LTTE's surviving 
business empire.
Meanwhile, Achchuthan has taken control of several businesses 
and supermarkets across France and Europe—remnants of 
the LTTE's once-expansive financial network. Outwardly, 
he appears to be just another businessman leading a normal 
life. Yet, beneath this facade lies a deliberate and insidious 
effort to destabilize Sri Lanka. For years, he and his network 
have quietly sown unrest, jeopardizing the fragile peace and 
manipulating former militants still tied to the conflict.
The 2014 LTTE revival attempt stands out as one of the most 
serious and well-coordinated efforts to resurrect the group 
since its military defeat in May 2009—allegedly funded by 
Achchuthan. The operation 
was led by three seasoned 
operatives: Suntharalingam 
Gajatheeban (alias 
Theiveegan), Navaratnam 
Navaneethan (alias Appan), 
and Ponniah Selvanayagam 
Kajeepan (alias Gobi). 
All three were killed in a 
military operation carried 
out by Sri Lankan forces. 
Among the trio, Theiveegan 
shared a particularly close 
bond with Achchuthan, as 
both had served as LTTE 
pilots during the conflict.
Today, Achchuthan 
and his inner circle are 
weaving a dangerous web, 
using individuals like 
Janaki to reconnect with 
former fighters who had 
seemingly left their militant 
lives behind. Through 
manipulation and coercion, 
they aim to drag these 
individuals back into the 
vortex of violence. Their 
objective is clear: to revive 
Interpol Red Notice against Sivarasa Pirunthapan (Achchuthan) 
Suntharalingam Gajatheeban, also 
known as Theiveegan</p>
