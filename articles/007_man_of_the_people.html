Man of the people
People and former LTTE fighters who closely 
interacted with Mahathaya shared their 
insights with the Jaffna Monitor, emphasizing 
that Mahathaya was a man of the people. 
Like Captain Pandithar (S. Ravindran), 
who was known to be a childhood friend 
of Prabhakaran and served as a Jaffna 
commander until his death in January 1985, 
Mahathaya also possessed a remarkable ability 
to connect with people easily. His capability to 
engage with individuals and sway them into 
supporting the LTTE was notable. Indeed, at 
a certain juncture, Mahathaya effectively led 
the LTTE's public relations (PR) efforts, even 
though there was no formally designated PR 
unit within the organization. His role in this 
capacity was significant, as he played a crucial 
role in shaping the LTTE's interactions and 
image with the public, leveraging his ability 
to connect with people and communicate the 
group's objectives and perspectives. 
In 1984, Mahathaya was appointed as 
the Vanni regional commander of the 
LTTE by Prabhakaran. The Vanni region, 
encompassing the districts of Kilinochchi, 
Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Vavuniya, was a 
crucial area for the LTTE. Sources within the LTTE 
have stated that Mahathaya served effectively as the 
Vanni commander. Significantly, in 1987, when the 
LTTE leadership had to relocate its Base to the Vanni 
region amidst the conflict with the Indian Peace 
Keeping Force, Mahathaya's network and contacts 
in the area proved invaluable. His connections and 
familiarity with the Vanni region greatly assisted 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE in establishing their new 
Base and continuing their operations during this 
critical period. 
Behind the Scenes: Mahathaya's 
Appointment as LTTE's Deputy Leader
Mahathaya's role in the history of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is indeed significant, as he was 
the first and ultimately the last person to be designated 
as the Deputy Leader of the organization. This position 
was not reestablished following Mahathaya's arrest and 
execution. Despite the lack of official documentation, 
credible sources have confirmed to the Jaffna Monitor 
that Mahathaya was appointed deputy leader by LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran in 1987.
Before the signing of the Indo-Lanka Accord on 
July 29, 1987, the Indian government extended an 
invitation to Prabhakaran for discussions in New 
Delhi. Initially reluctant, Prabhakaran eventually 
agreed to the visit. On July 24, 1987, he was flown 
from the Suthumalai Amman temple grounds to 
Chennai aboard an Indian Army military helicopter. 
From Chennai, he continued his journey to Delhi 
on a military flight. Accompanying him from 
Suthumalai were key LTTE figures 'Yogi' Yogaratnam 
and Thileepan, along with Hardeep Puri, who was 
then serving as the 1st Secretary of the Indian High 
Commission and is currently a Minister in Narendra 
Modi's Government. In Chennai, Prabhakaran was

joined by Anton Balasingham, the LTTE's chief 
political strategist, for the trip to Delhi. 
Before leaving for Delhi, Prabhakaran internally 
announced within the LTTE that Mahathaya would 
assume the role of Deputy Leader in his absence. 
While this appointment was not formalized through 
public statements or documented evidence, sources 
confirmed that Prabhakaran explicitly directed his 
cadres to adhere to Mahathaya's orders during his 
absence. 
Differing Perspectives on 
Mahathaya's Path to LTTE 
Leadership
Within the ranks of former LTTE members who spoke 
to the Jaffna Monitor, a divergence of opinion exists 
regarding the reasons behind Mahathaya's initial rise 
within the LTTE.
One school of thought suggests that Mahathaya's 
elevation was primarily due to his close relationship 
with Prabhakaran. These former members pointed 
out that Prabhakaran had known Mahathaya for 
a long time, and both hailed from the same place, 
Valvettithurai. This geographical and personal 
connection reportedly led Prabhakaran to view 
Mahathaya as harmless and trustworthy. Sources 
suggest that Prabhakaran's perception of Mahathaya 
significantly aided his rise within the LTTE. 
Additionally, sources pointed out to Jaffna monitor 
that Prabhakaran believed Mahathaya, colloquially 
known as 'Mokku Mahathaya,' was not a competitor 
for his leadership. This belief that Mahathaya could not 
effectively challenge Prabhakaran's authority, sources 
believe, further contributed to Mahathaya's elevation 
in the organization.
However, this view is contested by another group of 
former LTTE members. They believe Mahathaya's 
rise was more circumstantial, particularly following 
Kittu's departure to Chennai. They point out that Baby 
Pirabhakaran with Anton Balasingam, LTTE's chief strategist, and IPKF officer Major General Harikirat Singh in an IPKF helicopter.

Subramaniam, following Prabhakaran, was the most 
senior member of the LTTE. However, due to Baby 
Subramaniam's non-military background, Mahathaya, 
who followed him in terms of seniority, was the 
natural choice for a prominent position within the 
LTTE's military and operational framework.
Arrival of the IPKF
Following the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord 
on July 29, 1987, the Indian Peace Keeping Force 
(IPKF) entered Jaffna on July 30, 1987, as part of their 
mission in Sri Lanka. Initially, the arrival of the IPKF 
in Jaffna was met with a warm welcome from the local 
population. Unaware of the future implications, the 
people of Jaffna greeted the IPKF troops with garlands 
and flowers.
Kittu's Attack and the Rise of 
Mahathaya in the LTTE
On the night of March 29, 1987, approximately 4 and 
a half months before the IPKF entered Sri Lankan 
soil, An unidentified assailant attacked the Mitsubishi 
Lancer carrying Kittu on Jaffna's Second Cross Street. 
When the attack happened, Kittu was en route to meet 
his girlfriend, Cynthia, a medical student at Jaffna 
University. The assailant fired at the vehicle and lobbed 
a powerful grenade; Kittu suffered a severe injury, with 
his right leg being virtually severed, an injury that led 
to its eventual amputation. This marked the end of 
Kittu's long and distinguished military career with the 
LTTE.
Following this life-altering incident, Kittu relocated 
to Chennai, where he took charge of the LTTE's 
propaganda office. The perpetrator of this attack 
remains unidentified to this day, with even the 
once-powerful LTTE intelligence wing under Pottu 
Amman's leadership failing to determine who was 
behind it.
This incident, however, had a significant repercussion 
within the LTTE ranks. It paved the way for 
Mahathaya to ascend within the organization. With 
Kittu's move to Chennai and his shift away from active 
military involvement, Mahathaya's prominence within 
the LTTE increased substantially. He returned to Jaffna 
from the Vanni region and took on a more central role, 
overseeing military actions against Indian forces. 
The rising popularity of 
Mahathaya
The relationship between the Indian Peace Keeping 
Force (IPKF) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) took a significant turn for the worse, ultimately 
leading to open conflict. By October 1987, the tensions 
between the two groups had escalated to the point of 
full-scale warfare. 
In December 1987, following intense clashes with 
Indian forces, the LTTE retreated to the Vanni region. 
In this strategic move, Prabhakaran established his 
Base in Nittakaikkulam, Mullaitivu, while Mahathaya 
set up his Base in Omanthai Koliyankulam. During 
this critical period, Mahathaya's connections and 
deep familiarity with the Vanni region greatly assisted 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE in establishing their new 
bases and continuing their operations.
During the fight, LTTE had captured 18 Indian Army 
soldiers and, in a move aimed at enhancing their 
public relations, decided to hand these soldiers over 
to Indian authorities. This gesture was designed to 
attract media attention and took place in the presence 
of prominent Indian journalists. The handover 
events were held in Chavakachcheri and Uduvil, with 
Mahathaya at the forefront, personally overseeing 
Kiddu with his wife Cynthia in Chennai</p>

the process. Adding to the significance of these 
events, Raheem, described in a WikiLeaks cable as 
the "trilingual aristocrat" and spokesperson for Kittu, 
arrived in Jaffna on an Indian Army flight from 
Chennai, accompanied by about 15 Indian journalists.
This strategic move by the LTTE was not only to 
boost its image but also stemmed from practical 
considerations. The LTTE, engaged in intense warfare 
and continually on the move, was not equipped to 
detain prisoners of war. Furthermore, there was 
a conscious decision not to harm these soldiers. 
Raheem candidly expressed to the Jaffna Monitor that 
the captured soldiers were not viewed as significant 
adversaries. Furthermore, there was an element of 
seeking 'vilasam,' a Tamil term playfully used here to 
mean publicity, especially after inflicting significant 
blows on the world's fourth-largest army.<br />
The event was widely covered in prominent 
newspapers worldwide. This occasion received 
considerable global attention. The coverage of this 
event not only brought substantial publicity to the 
LTTE but also particularly highlighted Mahathaya's 
role in the process. The image of Mahathaya 
alongside Brigadier Manjit Singh Minhas during 
the handover became emblematic of this moment. 
This act and its extensive news coverage significantly 
enhanced Mahathaya's status in the international 
arena. It showcased him as a key player in the LTTE's 
interactions with external entities. 
Media Spotlight on Mahathaya: 
The Face of LTTE in Peace Talks
During this period, anti-India sentiment escalated in 
southern Sri Lanka. In the 1988 presidential election, 
held on December 19, Ranasinghe Premadasa 
succeeded J.R. Jayewardene amidst a backdrop of 
conflict in the north and east between the Indian Peace 
Mahathaya, Shankar, Raheem along with IPKF officers 
talking to press persons after handing over 18 IPKF 
soldiers to Indian authorities.
