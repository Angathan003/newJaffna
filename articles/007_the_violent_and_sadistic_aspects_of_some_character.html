    <title>The violent and sadistic aspects of some characters in your stories may seem excessive to the point of discomfort for some readers, leading them to disengage from your writing. This has created a general perception that the writings of Shobashakthi are characterized by such violence. I'm aware of readers who have chosen not to read Shoba Shakthi for this reason. Isn't losing readers a concern for you?</title>

you read about violence in my stories, you 
despise the aggressors, don't you? You develop 
an intense dislike for violence itself, don't you? 
That's exactly what I aim for.
The violent and sadistic aspects 
of some characters in your stories 
may seem excessive to the point 
of discomfort for some readers, 
leading them to disengage from 
your writing. This has created a 
general perception that the writings 
of Shobashakthi are characterized 
by such violence. I'm aware of 
readers who have chosen not to 
read Shoba Shakthi for this reason. 
Isn't losing readers a concern for 
you?
Losing readers is certainly a concern. But what 
worries me more is hiding the truth in my 
writing. I don't aim to comfort my readers with 
my writing. I believe disturbing the readers' 
peace is the essence of good art. 
Tolstoy's words, 'Peace is the lowliest state of 
the soul,' are sacred to me.
I would consider you as a Sri Lankan 
writer who has captivated Indian 
readers in this generation. How 
was this alchemy achieved? Also, 
how do you view the accusation 
that you write specifically for Indian 
readers?
Good literature knows no national boundaries. 
We intensely read the works of Indian, French, 
and Russian writers, don't we? Similarly, Indian 
readers read good literature from our region. 
There's no alchemy here. Tamil Nadu readers 
have celebrated many Sri Lankan Tamil writers 
before me, like S. Ponnudurai, K Daniel, Mu. 
Thalayasingam, Piramil, and A. Muthulingam.
The accusation that I write solely for Indian 
readers is baseless. That would be nothing more 
than parochial literary narrow-mindedness, 
akin to running a horse inside a pot. Don't 
my writings appeal to and are read by Eelam 
Tamils? I write for an international audience. 
My stories reach readers in multiple languages 
including Malayalam, French, English, Dutch, 
and Sinhalese. I am in an ongoing conversation 
with them.
What are your next literary and 
artistic endeavours?
My upcoming literary endeavours include 
acting in the play 'Counting and Cracking,' 
which will be performed in Melbourne in June, 
Sydney in July, and New York in September. 
This play, set between 1956 and 2004, revolves 
around the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and 
involves Tamil, Sinhalese, and Burgher actors. 
I'm also scheduled to act in a movie by the end 
of this year. As usual, I'm continuing to write 
short stories and am planning my sixth novel.
My novel 'Salam Alaik' is going to be published 
in French and 'Box' in English. I'm collaborating 
with publishers on the final stages of these 
books.
''As part of the organizing committee for 
a literary meeting in Paris tomorrow, my 
commitments beckon, and we must draw 
this interview to a close. Let's look forward 
to delving deeper in our next conversation, 
comrade," Shobasakthi concluded, signalling 
an end to this captivating interview session.</p>
