INTERVIEW
"Ethnic and Religious Nationalism 
Is Neither Democratic Nor 
Progressive - It Breeds Hatred and 
Authoritarianism"

Our Special 
Correspondent
- LTTE Co-founder Ragavan 
in an Exclusive Interview 
with Jaffna Monitor
Part  04
H
e helped forge the iron of the 
LTTE, stood shoulder-to-shoulder 
with the infamous Prabhakaran in his 
early militant days, and witnessed the 
birth of a movement that would scar a 
nation-and, to some extent, the world.
Chinniah Rajeshkumar, better known as 
Ragavan, wasn’t just a member; he was 
a co-founder-an architect of the early 
Tamil liberation struggle. But by April 
1984, disillusioned by the rising tide of 
extremism, senseless violence, brutal 
internal power plays, and the almost 
religious cult surrounding Prabhakaran, 
Ragavan made a life-altering choice. He 
severed ties with the LTTE and sought 
refuge in London.</p>

Now a legal advisor and activist, Ragavan 
carries the weight of history, the clarity of 
hindsight, and a deep understanding of the 
world’s workings—especially the dynamics of 
left and right politics.
In this exclusive interview series with Jaffna 
Monitor, he breaks his silence, offering 
unparalleled insights into the tumultuous 
early days of the LTTE and the politics that 
shaped—and shattered—an era.
This compelling interview is being published 
in parts, each revealing a deeper layer of this 
extraordinary story.
Some critics argue that the LTTE 
was founded more as a revenge-
driven organization rather than a true 
liberation movement. They claim that 
Prabhakaran was a mastermind of 
vengeance and that the LTTE lacked 
the profound ideological wisdom 
necessary to achieve the freedom of 
an ethnic group. How do you respond 
to this perspective?
I disagree. While vengeance played a role in 
decision-making, categorizing the LTTE solely 
as a revenge-driven organization would be 
an oversimplification. Revenge was part of a 
broader Tamil nationalist project, where unity 
and the notion of sole representation were 
central. Within this framework, a ‘traitor’ was 
seen as a greater threat than the enemy itself.
In the 1970s, young men who took up arms 
believed that the greatest enemies of Tamil 
liberation were Tamils aligned with the major 
southern political parties—the UNP and 
SLFP—as well as Tamil intelligence officers 
in the Sri Lankan police force. Consequently, 
eliminating ‘traitors’ was seen as a necessary 
first step, with Tamil nationalists propagating 
the idea that "weeds" needed to be removed 
for a healthy crop to grow. Until the late 1970s, 
I too was convinced that ‘traitors’ had to be 
eliminated, as Tamil nationalist ideology had 
taken deep root in my mind.
In LTTE parlance, the term "traitor" soon 
became synonymous with dissenters and rival 
militant organizations. By 1986, the LTTE 
had completely lost its liberatory character, 
transforming into an authoritarian military 
structure. I believe this is the inherent nature 
of ethnic nationalism.
Could you elaborate on why you 
believe ethnic nationalism leads to 
authoritarianism and exclusion?
Ethnic nationalist movements, by their very 
nature, are exclusionary—both politically 
and culturally—inevitably leading to 
authoritarianism, fascism, and intolerance. 
In ethnic nationalist discourse, language and 
culture are depicted as unique, pure, and 
immutable.
As political scientist and historian Benedict 
Anderson observes, nationalism lacks 
philosophical depth, and yet it remains a 
powerful political force. A nation, he argues, 
is an imagined political community—
constructed through cultural narratives—and 
is a modern phenomenon that emerged in late 
18th-century Europe.
However, I see a fundamental difference 
between national liberation movements 
against colonialism or settler colonialism and 
ethnic nationalist movements. Anti-colonial 
liberation movements were generally inclusive. 
For example, during India's independence 
struggle, people from various ethnic and</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

religious backgrounds were encouraged to 
join.
I am not, however, generalizing that anti-
colonial nationalist movements were entirely 
inclusive, as ethnic, caste, and religious factors 
often influenced the nationalist framework. 
For instance, Ambedkar and Periyar were 
skeptical of the Indian nationalist leadership 
due to the presence of Hindutva and 
Brahminical dominance within the Congress.
While Hindu nationalist tendencies did exist 
within the Indian National Congress—and 
organizations like the RSS openly promoted an 
exclusive Hindutva nationalism—leaders such 
as Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and 
Bhagat Singh advocated for inclusivity.
Similarly, the African National Congress 
(ANC), under Nelson Mandela’s leadership, 
championed an inclusive struggle, even 
welcoming progressive individuals from the 
white settler colonial community into the 
liberation movement. South Africa, after all, 
was under apartheid rule imposed by white 
settler colonialists. That said, anti-colonial 
movements were not entirely free from ethnic, 
caste, or religious biases.
Sri Lanka, in contrast, lacked a strong anti-
colonial movement. Independence was 
merely ‘granted’ by the British, resulting in the 
creation of an ethnocratic nation-state.
Sri Lanka's post-colonial nation-building 
project was shaped by Sinhala ethno-
nationalism, which asserted that the entire 
island belonged exclusively to Sinhala 
Buddhists. The political imagination was that 
Sri Lanka was collectively owned by Sinhala 
Buddhists, leaving little space for minorities. 
In response to this ethnocratic state structure, 
Tamil ethno- nationalists asserted that the 
north and east were the traditional homelands 
of Tamils, collectively owned by them based 
on the modern construction of centuries of 
unique cultural and linguistic heritage.
When such notions of exclusive ownership 
became a political force, those perceived as 
outsiders were denied the right to live in 
these regions, they could be expelled, killed, 
or ethnically cleansed. This ideology justified 
anti-Tamil pogroms, during which Tamils 
were killed, beaten, and their properties 
destroyed.
Likewise, when Tamil ethno-nationalism 
gained dominance in the north and east, 
Sinhalese residents were expelled or killed by 
Tamil militants following the 1983 pogroms. 
The LTTE further reinforced this exclusivity 
when it became the dominant force after 
1986, culminating in the ethnic cleansing of 
Muslims from the north in 1990. The moment 
Muslims sought to assert a separate identity,</p>

they were cast as the ‘other.’
This leads me to an essential question: 
Can landless people—especially oppressed 
castes who were denied land rights for 
centuries and Malayaga Tamils, who have 
historically been denied land rights—
invoke the idea of a traditional homeland?
My argument is that ethnic and religious 
nationalism is neither democratic nor 
progressive. It is inherently divisive, 
fostering hatred, suspicion, and 
authoritarianism. This is a crucial lesson 
from the Tamil nationalist struggle.
Did you and the early militants 
who took up arms have the 
understanding and vision to 
achieve liberation for the minority 
community and build a nation?
Prabhakaran, I, and many others initially 
believed we were merely igniting the 
struggle—it was up to the next generation 
to carry it forward. We saw our actions as 
a spark, a catalyst rather than a complete 
movement.
However, a complex historical trajectory 
eventually led to the formation of a Tamil 
national liberation army.
In 1977, Sri Lanka transitioned to a 
neoliberal, market-oriented economy, 
abandoning its earlier state-controlled 
economic policies and principles aligned 
with the Non-Aligned Movement. 
This shift—heavily influenced by 
Western neoliberal ideology—involved 
liberalization, privatization, and the 
opening of the economy to foreign 
investment.</p>

India, which had traditionally aligned itself 
with socialist countries and played a leading 
role in the Non-Aligned Movement, viewed 
Sri Lanka’s realignment with the West as a 
geopolitical threat to regional security.
There is a widespread myth that neoliberalism 
and democratic norms go hand in hand. In 
reality, neoliberalism frequently coexists with 
authoritarianism. For instance, in 1973—amid 
Cold War tensions—Chile became a testing 
ground for neoliberal economic reforms. The 
Augusto Pinochet regime crushed political 
opposition, suppressed trade unions, and was 
responsible for widespread torture, killings, 
and disappearances. Indigenous lands were 
expropriated and handed over to corporations 
and wealthy elites.
Pinochet’s authoritarian rule, paired with 
neoliberalism, was seen as essential for 
fundamentally reshaping national politics and 
culture. While Western powers championed 
democracy and human rights at home, they 
actively supported Pinochet’s regime abroad.
A similar pattern emerged in Sri Lanka during 
the mid-1970s. Neoliberalism was introduced 
under the veneer of democracy, while trade 
unions were weakened and authoritarianism 
was institutionalized. The creation of the 
executive presidency and the introduction 
of repressive laws such as the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA)—primarily used to 
arrest, torture, and detain Tamil youths—
marked this transition.
India, recognizing the rising discontent among 
Tamils, sought to capitalize on it by supporting 
Tamil militant groups as a strategic tool—to 
exert pressure on Colombo and to influence 
the unfolding conflict.
The 1983 state-sponsored anti-Tamil pogrom 
became a turning point. The violence 
dramatically increased recruitment into 
militant groups. Tamil support for militancy 
was less a product of ideological conviction 
and more a visceral reaction to state violence. 
Many Tamil youths, radicalized by the 
pogrom, saw armed struggle as the only viable 
path to securing a homeland.
India played a critical role in this phase, by 
training, arming, and funding Tamil militant 
groups—decisively shaping the trajectory of 
the armed resistance. The LTTE eventually 
emerged as the most powerful among them, 
positioning itself as the sole representative of 
the Tamil people. The rest is history.
Some political analysts argue that if 
leftist democratic forces had led the 
Sri Lankan Tamil movement against 
the Sinhala-dominated government, 
the outcome would have been 
different. What is your perspective on 
this view?
They mistakenly assume that the right to 
self-determination applies universally to all 
national liberation struggles. Lenin’s concept 
of the national question must be understood 
within its specific historical and imperialist 
context.
According to Lenin, one aspect concerned 
Russian imperialism and the oppression of 
nationalities within the empire; the other 
focused on colonial imperialism and anti-
colonial nationalist struggles.
While he supported the right to self-
determination to weaken imperialism, his 
ultimate goal was a socialist revolution. He 
warned against unconditional support for all</p>

nationalist movements and urged Marxists 
to distinguish between revolutionary and 
reactionary nationalism.
In Sri Lanka’s case, applying Lenin’s principle 
to Tamil ethnic nationalism amounts to 
endorsing an exclusive and reactionary form 
of nationalism. Sri Lanka is not an imperialist 
power in itself but rather functions as an agent 
of imperialism.
As political philosopher Frantz Fanon 
observed, the national bourgeoisie in post-
colonial states often serve as proxies for 
Western capital—indulging in decadence 
while failing to fulfill their historic role of 
driving genuine national development. Sri 
Lanka’s current economic crisis and the 
elite’s misappropriation of public funds only 
reinforce Fanon’s warning.
Globalization has intensified such exploitation. 
Garment workers in Free Trade Zones, for 
instance, face long hours, poor pay, and union-
busting tactics—despite the sector generating 
nearly $6 billion in exports.
Malayaga Tamils in plantations continue to 
struggle for a basic wage of 1,000 rupees a 
day. Likewise, domestic workers in the Middle 
East suffer abuse and low wages. These forms 
of exploitation cut across ethnic lines, though 
certain sectors remain ethnically concentrated.
Meanwhile, land appropriation in the name of 
development has deepened landlessness and 
environmental degradation. Both Sinhala and 
Tamil nationalists often ignore these systemic 
issues and are trapped in romanticized pasts. 
What we need is resistance that transcends 
ethnicity and unites people across class, caste, 
and gender.
The traditional left’s approach—treating 
Lenin’s principle as sacred doctrine—fails to 
account for evolving socio-political realities. 
In practice, the Tamil nationalist struggle and 
the demand for self-determination have not 
fostered a space where democratic socialist 
norms and values can flourish.
Instead, class unity has been deeply 
fragmented by both Sinhala and Tamil ethnic 
nationalisms, as well as by the ethnocratic 
nature of the state. The result has been the 
emergence of an authoritarian state and the 
authoritarianism of the LTTE.
Political strategy must evolve in response to 
material conditions, rather than remain bound 
to outdated conceptual frameworks.
Today, national sovereignty itself is challenged 
by neoliberal globalization. Borders—national, 
cultural, and political—are increasingly fluid. 
Yet some leftists in the South continue to 
advocate self-determination without rigorous 
analysis, seeing the Tamil issue as something 
for Tamils alone. This reflects both intellectual 
laziness and a lack of class analysis.
Some Tamil leftists claim that had the 
movement been led by leftist forces, it would 
have been more inclusive. But their worldview 
remains essentially nationalist, cloaked 
in socialist language. What’s missing is a 
commitment to socialism’s core values: human 
emancipation, justice, and democracy.
Ethnic nationalism promotes ideas 
of uniqueness and purity, which are 
fundamentally at odds with pluralism and 
democratic norms. In ethnic nationalist 
discourse, the denial of the right to dissent is 
intertwined with the depoliticization of the 
masses.
It disregards class, caste, and gender divisions,</p>

LTTE to centralize power. 
Believing that a left-led 
Tamil movement would have 
changed the outcome is, in my 
view, wishful thinking.
Instead, we must learn from 
the Aragalaya, which emerged 
during the recent economic 
crisis. As Italian Marxist 
Antonio Gramsci observed, 
“It may be ruled out that 
the immediate economic 
crises of themselves produce 
fundamental historical events; 
they can simply create a 
terrain more favorable to 
the dissemination of certain 
modes of thought and certain 
ways of posing and resolving 
questions involving the entire 
subsequent development of 
national life.”
For the first time in post-
independence Sri Lanka, an 
economic crisis gave rise to a 
political consciousness rooted 
in cross-ethnic unity.
Yet the Aragalaya was 
not confined to minority 
concerns. Its vision 
emphasized people’s 
democracy, social justice, 
redistribution, and equal 
access to education, 
employment, and healthcare. 
It represented a call for an 
inclusive political future.
This is only a beginning, 
but it offers a potential path 
forward. We must build on the 
promoting ethnic unity at the expense of broader goals of 
social justice. Groups like the EPRLF, EROS, and NLFT 
attempted to merge ethnic nationalism with class struggle, 
arguing that Tamil national liberation was a necessary 
first step toward socialism. However, this framework was 
fundamentally flawed. Their failure stemmed not from weak 
leadership, but from the inherent contradiction between 
ethnic nationalism and inclusive leftist politics.
Tamil nationalist discourse portrayed Tamils as a unified 
whole, silencing internal differences and enabling the</p>

counter-hegemonic discourse that emerged 
during the Aragalaya while recognizing 
that categories like ethnicity are historically 
constructed—not fixed. Unity cannot be 
achieved by ignoring differences, but by 
acknowledging and working through them.
A former early member of the LTTE 
mentioned that you were the only 
person he ever saw smoking a 
cigarette in front of Prabhakaran, 
suggesting that, in the early days, he 
was not perceived as a supreme figure 
within the organization. In your view, 
when did Prabhakaran transition from 
being a friend and companion to an 
object of reverence? Did you notice 
any early signs of this transformation 
within the LTTE?
In the initial days, although Prabhakaran 
prohibited smoking, those who were already 
smokers were allowed to continue. I was 
a smoker, along with a few others such as 
Patkunam, Ravi, and Matthaya. We were given 
a ration of five cigarettes per day.
Until I left the organization, Prabhakaran 
treated me as a companion. However, from 
1980 onwards, I began to question the LTTE’s 
ideology, which made him view me as a 
problematic figure. He expected unquestioning 
loyalty, but I believe he still had a soft spot for 
me, as I had provided him protection during 
the 1970s when he lacked widespread support.
After 1983, he emerged as a ruthless, 
charismatic, and authoritarian leader. I don’t 
see this as a sudden transformation but rather 
as a process. However, it was difficult for me to 
address him as "leader."
Let me share a humorous anecdote. After the 
1983 pogroms, several Tamil youths from 
Germany, the UK, and France traveled to India 
to join the militant organizations. Among 
them was a man named Bahi.  By then, 
Prabhakaran had assumed the title of supreme 
leader and was addressed as Thalaivar by the 
new recruits, while most senior members still 
called him Thambi (younger brother). Bahi, 
unsure of how to strike a balance between 
respect and familiarity, coined the term 
'Thalaivar Thambi Anna' (Leader–Younger 
Brother–Elder Brother).
As I mentioned in the first part of my 
interview, by the early 1980s, Prabhakaran 
had already begun to perceive himself as 
the embodiment of Tamil Eelam—almost 
as if he were destined to achieve it. While 
he never explicitly stated this, his actions 
made it clear that he believed he alone could 
create Tamil Eelam, and that, regardless of 
the odds, he would carve it out through sheer 
determination. After 1983, with the expansion 
of militancy, he became an even more ruthless, 
authoritarian, and charismatic leader.
Before 1983, the LTTE was a small 
organization. While it carried out 
assassinations of ‘traitors’ and police officers, it 
was not a formidable force, and Prabhakaran 
was not widely known. Yet, within the LTTE, 
he had already begun asserting himself as the 
undisputed leader. The rapid expansion of the 
LTTE and other militant groups after 1983, 
coupled with Indian training and support, 
brought them into the public spotlight.
The LTTE and other militant groups actively 
engaged in propaganda, publishing official 
newspapers. This outreach made Tamils in 
Sri Lanka increasingly aware of the militant</p>

organizations, leading to greater 
financial and logistical support. At this 
juncture, militant leaders gained official 
recognition.
Both local and international media—
especially Indian media—began 
covering the militant movements and 
their leaders. Their interviews were 
published along with their photographs, 
making them recognizable figures. 
Prabhakaran was meticulous about his 
public image; he would have multiple 
photos taken and carefully select the 
best one for publication.
In early 1984, I had a conversation 
with Balasingham about the LTTE’s 
internal repression and undemocratic 
practices. He acknowledged these 
issues and told me that until 1983, 
Prabhakaran was merely a chieftain. 
However, as the number of cadres 
grew and his prominence increased, he 
suddenly became a king. To maintain 
control and assert his authority, 
Prabhakaran resorted to intensifying 
internal repression and consolidating 
authoritarianism to its full extent.
The LTTE, in many ways, was a product 
of the society from which it emerged. 
Tamil society had deeply entrenched 
caste hierarchies and a long history 
of gender oppression, with power 
traditionally concentrated in the hands 
of dominant-caste men. Similarly, the 
patriarchal family structure reinforced 
male dominance in social, cultural, and 
political spheres. I believe this mindset 
shaped the structure and functioning of 
the LTTE as well.
The idea of one leader, one ideology, 
and one movement may have been 
an extension of the hierarchical and patriarchal 
tendencies of Tamil society, reinforced by ethnic 
nationalist discourse. Over time, this belief system 
elevated Prabhakaran into an unquestionable 
supreme leader. And he did not resist this 
transformation—he fully embraced it.
Early members of the LTTE, including 
Anton Master—the then Military Office 
Chief ‘of the LTTE—told us that within 
the organization, loyalty to Prabhakaran 
was prioritized over talent. Those who 
praised him and remained loyal were given 
preference over individuals with genuine 
talent and commitment. What is your take 
on this?</p>

It is a mix of loyalty and competence. 
Prabhakaran always placed utmost importance 
on personal loyalty.  According to his 
perception, the leader and the movement are 
two sides of the same coin.  Loyalty to him was 
equated with loyalty to the organization itself.
However, as a military organization, the LTTE 
could not function solely based on loyalty—
it also required competence and strategic 
acumen. For instance, Baby Subramaniam 
was deeply devoted to Prabhakaran, but in 
my view, he did not possess the necessary 
leadership skills to build and manage a 
structured military command. He may 
have had other strengths, but he was never 
appointed to a high-ranking position to lead 
the LTTE’s armed unit.
Conversely, individuals like Karuna, 
Theepan, and Balraj were both unwaveringly 
loyal to Prabhakaran and highly skilled 
military commanders. Their rise within the 
organization was not purely due to their 
allegiance; their battlefield expertise, strategic 
thinking, and leadership capabilities also 
played a crucial role in their prominence.
One of the major allegations against 
you is that you were expelled from the 
LTTE due to your love for your wife, 
Nirmala. Some claim that this was the 
reason for your departure. What is the 
truth?
The claim that I was expelled due to my 
relationship with Nirmala is factually 
incorrect. When I left the LTTE in April 1984,<br />
Ragavan with his wife Nirmala</p>

Nirmala was still imprisoned in Batticaloa 
prison and I had never even met her. I had 
only met her first husband, Nithiyanandan, in 
India.
During the Batticaloa jailbreak in September 
1983, Nithiyanandan and others managed 
to escape, but Nirmala was left behind as 
she was held in the women’s section. In June 
1984, the LTTE carried out a separate prison 
break specifically to free her. By that time, 
I was no longer part of the movement. My 
relationship with Nirmala began only after I 
had left the LTTE, and after she too had left 
the organization at the end of 1984.
The truth is that neither Prabhakaran, any 
key figures within the LTTE, nor the LTTE as 
an institution ever made such an allegation 
against me officially.<br />
When serious criticisms were directed at 
the LTTE, and they were unable to provide 
a logical response, their primary strategy 
was character assassination. When it came 
to women, such slander often took on a 
particularly vicious and sexualized nature. 
While the LTTE itself never officially engaged 
in spreading falsehoods about me or Nirmala, 
they also made no effort to counter or refute 
the disinformation spread in their name by 
LTTE supporters.
Another relevant point—Prabhakaran’s wife, 
Mathivathani, was in love with a fellow student 
before she and her friends were abducted by 
the LTTE while on a hunger strike to death. 
What is undeniable is that she later distanced 
herself from her former lover and fell in love 
with Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran indeed loved 
Mathivathani, and she reciprocated those 
feelings.
Falling in love is natural. But if someone 
accuses me of wrongfully loving a woman who 
was married, then by the same logic, couldn't 
one argue that Prabhakaran falling in love 
with Mathivathani—who was still in love with 
someone else at the time—was also wrong? 
I am not making a moral judgment here, 
but those who criticize me on these grounds 
should not throw stones from a glasshouse.
After the LTTE split in 1979, although I 
supported Prabhakaran, I began to reflect 
on the ideological nature of the movement. 
While I was a nationalist at the time, I started 
questioning whether the organization’s 
intolerance of criticism and authoritarianism 
aligned with the principles of a true liberation 
movement.
In 1982, after the Pondy Bazaar shooting, I 
wrote a detailed letter to Anton Balasingham, 
expressing my concerns about the LTTE's 
trajectory and how it was veering off course. 
I was later informed by Balasingham that 
LTTE supporters in the UK had discussed 
my concerns and had kept that letter for a 
long time. However, as I mentioned earlier, 
after the events of 1983, there was no longer 
any space for political discussion. That said, I 
acknowledge my moral responsibility for all 
the actions committed by the LTTE until 1984, 
as I was a part of the organization during that 
period.
Now, let me clarify the reasons for my 
departure from the organization. The real 
reason I left the LTTE was that it had fully 
evolved into an extreme personality cult, 
devoid of internal democracy, and had become 
increasingly violent in its internal structure. 
Any other explanations given for my departure 
are simply false.
Did Prabhakaran force Mathivathani to 
love him?</p>

No, no—not at all. Their love developed 
naturally, and their relationship evolved 
organically. There was no coercion involved. 
However, there was an element of power as 
Prabakaran was a leader.
There are still lingering allegations 
that it was Prabhakaran-not the Sri 
Lankan forces-who killed Sellakili 
during the 1983 ambush that triggered 
the bloody ethnic violence. Some 
early LTTE members have told Jaffna 
Monitor that Sellakili may not have 
died from army bullets but from 
Prabhakaran’s own gunfire-possibly 
because he was seen as a potential 
threat to Prabhakaran’s leadership. 
How credible do you find these 
allegations? You were still in the LTTE 
at the time-what is your perspective on 
what really happened?
I believe it's incorrect to say that the 1983 
ambush triggered the ethnic violence. The 
University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) 
[UTHR(J)] reported that, in the weeks leading 
up to the Black July violence of 1983, the 
government had already been preparing to 
unleash massive force against Tamils. The 
ambush was used merely as a convenient 
starting point. Tamil addresses had been 
collected in advance, and it was a meticulously 
planned operation orchestrated by ministers 
like Cyril Mathew, who had even organized a 
private army. Several credible sources confirm 
that the 1983 pogrom was premeditated and 
that the JR government aided and abetted its 
execution.
Regarding the question of Sellakili’s death, I 
cannot confirm that LTTE leader Prabhakaran 
personally shot and killed him. However, there 
was suspicion that Prabhakaran may have 
ordered his execution.
I was not part of the LTTE at the time. In fact, 
after the Pondy Bazaar shooting in 1982, I 
became increasingly disillusioned with the 
LTTE’s militaristic and authoritarian direction 
and decided to remain in India.
Although I had initially planned to escape on 
bail with Prabhakaran and return to Sri Lanka, 
we had an argument before the escape. I told 
him that targeting PLOTE leaders was wrong 
and that we should instead negotiate with 
them to work together for a common cause. 
I even suggested holding a meeting with all 
LTTE members and, if the majority agreed that 
Umamaheswaran should be killed, I would 
carry out the task myself. But Prabhakaran 
rejected my proposal and stated that even if 
everyone opposed killing Umamaheswaran, 
he would still go ahead and do it himself. As 
a result, I chose not to accompany him to Sri 
Lanka. After escaping on bail, I remained 
underground in India and was inactive until 
the 1983 pogrom.
However, after the 1983 pogrom, I decided to 
re-engage with the LTTE. One member who 
had participated in the ambush (whom I will 
refer to as X, as he is still alive and it would 
be inappropriate to name him without his 
consent—he left the LTTE in 1984) told me 
that he suspected Sellakili was killed either 
by Kittu or Lala Ranjan. He said that Sellakili 
had a sexual relationship with a woman 
who became pregnant and that Prabhakaran 
decided to have him killed because of it.
It was an open secret within the organization 
that Sellakili had multiple sexual partners, 
even in the nascent years of the movement 
around 1977–78. Almost all of them were</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

55
married women. Prabhakaran was aware of 
this but never commented on it—he seemed 
to tolerate Sellakili’s behavior. However, the 
woman who became pregnant was unmarried. 
I believe she was a university student. I 
gathered that this issue became a talking point, 
and therefore, in order to preserve the ‘purity’ 
of the organization, Prabakaran must have felt 
compelled to take action against Sellakili.
According to X, Sellakili was the driver of 
the vehicle on the day of the ambush. Before 
the operation, he parked the vehicle, gave 
instructions to another member on how to 
start it, and handed over the keys. X noted 
that this was unusual, as Sellakili would 
never typically entrust the keys to anyone. 
He believed that Sellakili may have been 
suspicious of the possibility of “friendly fire.”
In any case, Prabhakaran had a mindset of 
eliminating ‘problematic’ members on the 
battlefield. When he was close to 
me, he shared his ideas openly. 
If a member failed to follow 
LTTE discipline or held differing 
views, rather than allowing 
them to leave the organization—
potentially creating a "traitor" 
or enemy—it was considered 
preferable to send them into 
battle. If they were not killed 
by the enemy, they could 
be eliminated by one of 
Prabhakaran’s trusted members, 
who would never reveal the 
truth. In fact, increasing the 
number of martyrs was seen as 
more beneficial than increasing 
the number of traitors, as it 
served the LTTE’s reputation and 
legacy. That was Prabhakaran’s 
logic.
Given the circumstantial evidence, there is a 
possibility that Sellakili might have been killed 
by ‘friendly fire.’ However, I cannot confirm 
this without concrete proof.
It is interesting to note that when Prabhakaran 
fell in love with Mathivathani, she became 
pregnant before their marriage, which 
took place on October 1, 1984. Their son, 
Charles Anthony, was born on April 18, 
1985—just over six months later. This means 
Mathivathani was already around two and 
a half months pregnant at the time of the 
wedding.
I leave it to the readers to contemplate 
the double standards involved. I want to 
emphasize that this is not an attempt at 
character assassination or a moral judgment, 
but rather an observation of the contradictions 
within the movement’s leadership.
