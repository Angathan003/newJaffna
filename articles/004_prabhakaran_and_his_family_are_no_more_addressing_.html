V
elupillai Manoharan, 
the elder brother of the 
late LTTE leader Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, currently resides 
in Denmark with his family. 
On May 18, 2024, marking the 
fifteenth anniversary of the 
end of the Sri Lankan civil war 
and the death of his brother, 
Manoharan organized a public 
commemorative ceremony 
at the DGI Huset conference 
center in Denmark.
The primary objective of this 
event was to unequivocally 
declare that Prabhakaran and 
his immediate family are no 
longer alive, aiming to put an 
end to the financial frauds being 
perpetrated in their name.
In an exclusive interview with 
the Jaffna Monitor, Manoharan 
discussed the motivations 
behind this ceremony. 
He emphasized that the 
commemoration was essential 
to counter the activities of a 
fraudulent individual named 
"Thuvaraga," who falsely claims 
to be Prabhakaran's daughter

and is orchestrated by a large fraudulent 
syndicate.
We present compelling excerpts from 
Manoharan's interview with the Jaffna 
Monitor:
Why did your family organize a 
commemorative ceremony for 
your brother and his family after 
15 years? What is the need for the 
commemoration now?
You need to understand one thing: my brother, 
Prabhakaran, was not the type to escape from a 
war zone, leaving his fighters and commanders 
behind. Nor would he ever let his family escape 
while hundreds of other families perished. My 
brother was a true warrior, and abandoning his 
cause is something a true warrior could never 
imagine doing. He fought for the noble dream 
of Tamil Eelam and died on the battlefield 
alongside his family.

15th anniversary of the brutal conclusion of the Sri Lankan war and the death of Prabhakaran.

I am sure that none of my brother's 
family members—Prabhakaran, his wife 
Mathivathani, my nephews Charles Antony 
and Balachandran, or my niece Thuvaraga—
are alive. All, except for young Balachandran, 
attained martyrdom on the battlefield, while 
Balachandran was killed cold-bloodedly by the 
Sri Lankan government. The need to organize 
this commemoration after 15 years arose from 
the emergence of a fake Thuvaraga.
In recent months, someone has falsely 
claimed to be my niece Thuvaraga, deceiving 
the diaspora out of millions of dollars. As 
Prabhakaran's elder brother, I felt it was 
my responsibility to end this nonsense. 
Additionally, there have been false rumours 
that my brother is alive and living abroad. 
To those LTTE supporters who still believe 
that my brother is alive, I want to remind 
you of one incident among many. In 1987, 
when senior commanders Kumarappa and 
Pulendran were about to be taken to Colombo 
by the Sri Lankan army, they took cyanide 
capsules on my brother's orders and died. A 
person of such resolve could never escape to 
live abroad with his family. 
Thousands of LTTE fighters died for my 
brother because they believed in him. He 
would never betray their trust by cowardly 
escaping from the war zone. Claiming that my 
brother or his family is alive and living in a 
European country is an insult to his legacy. He 
was a true warrior and leader who would never 
abandon his fighters and people in their time 
of need.
Why the commemoration after 15 long 
years?
If we had stayed silent, the lies about the fake 
Thuvaraga could have been accepted as truth, 
and innocent people would continue to lose 
their money. As Prabhakaran's elder brother, 
I have a responsibility to reveal the truth 
about what happened to him and his family. 
If we do not speak out, these false narratives 
will dominate, and everyone will believe this 
nonsense.
When did you come to know for sure 
that your brother is no more, given the 
ambiguity surrounding his death?
I was 100 per cent certain that he would not 
escape the war zone. In 2009, around May 25, 
a week after my brother's martyrdom, Priyan 
(Jeyaragavan Ariyam), the LTTE representative 
in Denmark, came to our house and informed 
us that my brother Prabhakaran was no 
more. He told us that Prabhakaran attained 
martyrdom on May 18.

May 1983 - At a clandestine training camp in the depths of Udaiyarkaddu jungle, Prabhakaran himself leads the charge, gripping 
a G3 A3 German gun. This weapon, typically wielded by the Pakistan army, has a storied journey—smuggled from Pakistan to 
Bangladesh, then to Calcutta, before being acquired by the LTTE. At this pivotal moment, the LTTE was a tight-knit group of fewer 
than 30 members, with only 20-25 participating in this intense training session.</p>

When did you last talk with your brother?
I talked with him often until the end of 2008. 
However, after 2009, when the war intensified, our 
communication became restricted. I last spoke with 
him a few months before May 2009, probably in 
March. During that conversation, I also spoke with his 
family and our parents, who were with him.
 What did your brother tell you?
He said the situation was getting out of hand and asked 
for advice since our parents were with him. I told him 
that due to the visa process restrictions, I couldn't

take our parents out immediately. 
Additionally, our mother, Parvathi 
Pillai, was paralyzed, which 
made obtaining a visa even more 
challenging. I conveyed this to my 
brother and said that our parents 
should do the same as others living 
in the war zone.</p>

Did he mention that the war was about 
to end and that the LTTE was going to 
be defeated?
No, he did not. He said they would continue to 
fight but acknowledged that the problems were 
overwhelming. However, he emphasized that 
they would fight bravely.
Did he mention his end?
No, he did not. But I was very certain that 
he would not escape the war zone, and I am 
sure he would not facilitate his family's escape 
either. On many occasions, we asked him to 
send at least one of his children to stay with us 
abroad, but he always refused.
When did you request this?
Many times. Even during the Indian army's 
presence in 1987, we requested it. We also 
asked about peacetime in 2004-05. In 1987, 
when Prabhakaran went into the forest 
to fight the Indian army, he lost contact 
with his family. During that time, his wife 
Mathivathani, son Charles Antony, and 
daughter Thuvaraga went to Denmark. 
Mathivathani's elder sister, Aruna Devi, and 
her elder brother, Sritharan, took them to 
Denmark. When Prabhakaran learned about 
this, he immediately called them back. I 
heard that he said, 'When my fighters' and 
commanders' children do not have the facility 
to go abroad, how can I send my wife and 
children there?
 Did you see any leadership qualities 
in him when he was younger? 
Look-wise, he was very average, and 
academically, he was also an average student. 
However, he exhibited different traits from an 
early age.
When the army or police physically and 
mentally abused us, we would come home and 
remain silent. But my brother always insisted 
that we should fight back. He often criticized 
the non-violent protests of our Tamil leaders.
Despite his young age, he frequently told us 
that the only language Sinhala chauvinists 
understand is retaliation. He believed they 
would never respond to peaceful protests from 
Tamils.
He often said, 'The only language these Sinhala

politicians and chauvinists understand is 
hitting back.' He believed that Tamils should 
retaliate and show their strength rather than 
passively enduring violence.
What was his first involvement in 
militancy?
He first joined the Tamil Students Federation 
(Tamil Manavar Peravai), headed by 
Sathiyaseelan, when he was only 16 years old. 
He was actively involved in the activities of the 
Tamil Students Federation, including making 
petrol bombs and hand grenades. Kuttimani 
(Selvarajah Yogachandran) and Thangathurai 
(Nadarajah Thangavelu) were also part of 
the Tamil Manavar Peravai. They were my 
classmates and friends. When Sathiyaseelan 
was arrested in 
1973, the activities 
of the Tamil 
Students Federation 
came to a halt.
How did your personal life get affected 
in your early years because of your 
brother's involvement in militancy?
After my brother assassinated Alfred 
Duraiappah in April 1975, the police couldn't 
find him, so they started arresting me. The 
notorious CID officer in the Jaffna district, 
Tamil Inspector T.L.B. Bastianpillai, arrested 
Sathiyaseelan

me multiple times and held me in custody at 
a place called King's House inside the Jaffna 
Fort.
Instead of capturing my brother Prabhakaran, 
he targeted me. Similarly, instead of Kuttimani, 
he arrested his younger brother 'Katti,' and 
instead of Nadesathasan, he arrested his 
elder brother Maheshathasan. All of us were 
tortured and beaten black and blue.
T.L.B. Bastianpillai also tried to force me to 
give a false confession 
about my brother. 
At that time, I was 
working at Vallai 
Textile, a well-known 
company. However, 
the CID's relentless 
harassment made it 
impossible for me to 
continue working. 
Due to this constant persecution, I had to leave 
the country in 1975. My father arranged a job 
for me on a ship, and on April 25, 1975, I left 
the country, never to return.
Was it true that your brother 
Prabhakaran met a woman who was a 
victim of the 1956 ethnic violence and 
that this encounter changed his life?
Yes, it is true. That woman was a distant 
relative who often visited our house seeking 
help. My father, being a generous man, always 
assisted her. Her hands had been severely 
burned by Sinhalese thugs during the 1956 
violence, causing them to fuse together. Seeing 
her condition deeply affected my younger 
brother. He would often ask us why we didn't 
fight back and why we just endured all the 
injustices.
Additionally, when we lived in Batticaloa, 
a lady who lived near our house frequently 
visited us. Her husband had been killed in the 
1956 pogrom. She often narrated the injustices 
she had endured. My brother, being only 7 or 
8 years old, would listen to these stories while 
sitting on our mother's lap. I believe these 
experiences of encountering innocent victims 
profoundly changed his way of thinking.
How were your parents' characters? 
Were they brave or innocent?
My father was a government servant, working 
as a land officer and later as the district 
land officer. He could have easily become 
an Assistant Government Agent (AGA) or 
Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO), but he 
was content with his position as a land officer. 
During his tenure, he initiated several land 
schemes, such as the Muthyankatu Land

Scheme and the Vishwamadu Educated 
Student Land Scheme, all under his 
supervision.
He worked diligently until his natural 
retirement in 1983. He was a very honest land 
officer. 
Once, I met X. M. Sellathambu, a former MP 
of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal 
Party) in Vavuniya. He told me about my 
father's integrity. He said that when the new 
Vavuniya town was being built, my father, 
who was in charge of allocating land for shops, 
theatres, and schools, was advised by many to 
take some prime land in his relatives' names. 
But he refused.
I am certain that he did not earn a single 
penny illegally during his years as a 
government servant. He never drank alcohol, 
smoked, or even chewed betel leaves. My 
brother Prabhakaran inherited these good 
qualities from my father.
My mother, Parvathy Pillai, was a different 
character. She was very brave. While my 
father was soft-spoken, my mother was 
courageous. She spoke boldly to the police 
who came searching for Prabhakaran. Once, 
Inspector Bastianpillai came to our house 
and asked, "Where is your younger son?" My 
mother boldly replied, "That is your job to find 
out." He then slapped her on the cheek and 
threatened to bring Prabhakaran back like a 
wounded man from an aeroplane accident. My 
mother boldly retorted, "Don't talk; do it." This 
infuriated them, and they arrested her and 
took her to the police station.
 When did Prabhakaran leave your 
house forever?
It was in 1974 when Prabhakaran left our 
house for good. That evening, a known 
friend of his came to our home and called for 
Prabhakaran by name. Prabhakaran wasn't 
there at the time, and another person had 
accompanied his friend. When Prabhakaran 
returned, we informed him about the visitors. 
He told us that the friend who had come 
calling had already been arrested by the 
police, and he was curious to know who had 
accompanied him.

Prabhakaran then took out a 
file containing photos of CID 
officers, and I identified the 
man who had come with his 
friend. Prabhakaran told me 
that it was Bastianpillai. That 
very night, a large group of 
army and police officers came 
to our house to arrest him. 
However, Prabhakaran was not 
in his bed; he had escaped and 
never returned home.
Before escaping, he 
meticulously destroyed all 
pictures of himself from the 
family albums. The only photo 
the police had of him was 
taken during his GCE O/L 
exams for his admission card. 
In that photo, he had cut his 
hair short and looked very 
different from his usual self. 
He was very cautious about his 
personal safety, even from a 
young age.
Did you observe that your brother had the traits 
of a leader who could potentially lead an armed 
struggle?
No, he was just my younger brother, and I didn't see any 
particular qualities that stood out as those of a future leader. 
In fact, both my father and I did not want him to go into 
armed struggle. We advised him many times against it. My 
father even arranged a job for him on a ship, hoping he would 
choose a different path. But he was not ready to listen to us.
Who is behind the fake Thuvaraga?
There is a large syndicate involved in 
this deception. Organizations such as 
the Tamil Coordinating Committee 
(TCC) and the World Tamil 
Coordinating Committee (WTCC) are 
implicated in this fraudulent scheme. 
The TCC, for example, used to collect 
200 kroner every month from each 
family in Denmark. We contributed 
from 1998 until 2006. In 2006, we 
discovered that the TCC was not 
sending the money to Tamil Eelam 
as intended but was instead diverting

a fraudster for a long time. In 2004, he brought 
a man to me, claiming he was from Tamil Eelam 
and needed help. I gave him 25,000 kronor, but 
later, I found out that the man was actually from 
Italy, not Tamil Eelam. I even informed my brother 
Prabhakaran about this. Ironically, Aruna Devi's

Former Member of Parliament 
Sivajilingam has made a few 
allegations about you, claiming that 
you did not help your parents. How do 
you respond to these accusations?
First of all, Sivajilingam is not related to us, 
not even distantly. He used our name for 
his own fame, trying to portray himself as a 
close relative of Prabhakaran to gain money 
and fame. When my father passed away, our 
brother (not a direct brother but a close family 
relation) was about to handle the cremation. 
However, Sivajilingam somehow intervened, 
used his influence, and performed the final 
rites. He then profited substantially from this.
Even my sister, who resides in Canada, sent 
him 4 lakhs. Additionally, he received money 
from various diaspora associations. I know he 
collected money from many people and foreign 
associations using my parents' funeral as an 
excuse. He is a dishonest person who exploited 
our family's situation and name for personal 
gain, and he continues to profit from it.
What would you like to tell the LTTE 
supporters who still idolize your 
brother and somehow long for his 
miraculous return?
My brother, Prabhakaran, and his entire family 
are no more. They all attained martyrdom. 
It is essential to accept this reality. Please do 
not fall prey to these fraudsters who claim to 
be my brother's family. These individuals are 
exploiting your emotions and the legacy of my 
brother for their own gain.
If you genuinely want to honour Prabhakaran's 
memory, focus on helping our people in Sri 
Lanka. Many Tamils who were affected by 
the war still live in abject poverty and face 
daily struggles. They need your support more 
than ever. Channel your efforts and resources 
toward rebuilding the lives of these war-
affected individuals. Support initiatives that 
provide education, healthcare, and economic 
opportunities for them.
Remember, the best way to keep my 
brother's legacy alive is by working towards 
the betterment of our Tamil community 
and ensuring that those who have suffered 
do not continue to live in hardship. Your 
contributions can make a significant difference 
in their lives.</p>

Jaffna, Sri Lanka - In a monumental stride 
towards advancing medical education and 
healthcare in the Northern Province, President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the 
cutting-edge Clinical Training and Research 
Block at the University of Jaffna's Faculty 
of Medicine on May 24th. This impressive 
facility, constructed with an investment of LKR 
942 million, is set to revolutionize medical 
training and treatment in the region. Despite 
its inauguration coinciding with the imminent 
presidential election, experts unanimously 
agree that this development marks a 
significant milestone for Jaffna, promising 
enhanced healthcare services and educational 
opportunities for future generations.

Spanning 6,000 square meters, the newly 
inaugurated building is the first of its kind to 
be constructed in 46 years at the University of 
Jaffna. According to a press release from the 
President's office, it includes multiple lecture 
halls, clinical skills laboratories, an auditorium, 
and essential medical facilities such as 
operating theatres, recovery rooms, and 
research labs. The facility will accommodate 
1,200 students for both undergraduate and 
postgraduate clinical training, fostering 
international research collaborations.
"The construction of this building marks 
a significant milestone. With this new 
facility, we are taking a major step towards 
elevating the standards of medical education 
in the Northern Province," President 
Wickremesinghe remarked during the 
ceremony.
The President's media unit highlighted that 
the Clinical Training and Research Block 
is equipped with patient waiting rooms, 
consultation rooms, and specialized units 
dedicated to endoscopy, vascular surgery, 
and mammography. It also houses research 
laboratories, a forensic investigation unit, 
and a museum for educational purposes. 
The Fertility Care Unit, managed by the 
Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 
will offer specialist consultations, diagnostic 
procedures, and treatment facilities.
The Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) will facilitate 
clinical research on locally adapted, cost-
effective treatment methods, while the Clinical 
Genetics Unit (CGU) will focus on genetic 
cost-effectiveness, disease management, and 
preventive measures.
In his address, President Wickremesinghe 
unveiled ambitious plans to elevate Jaffna 
Hospital to a national hospital, aiming to 
ensure top-tier healthcare standards in the 
Northern Province.
Following his visit, a formal proposal to 
upgrade Jaffna Teaching Hospital was 
swiftly submitted to the Sri Lankan Cabinet. 
This proposal, championed by Minister 
Douglas Devananda, received President 
Wickremesinghe's endorsement during the 
Cabinet meeting on May 27th. As a result 
of this initiative, Jaffna Teaching Hospital is 
poised for significant enhancements, including 
improvements in physical infrastructure and 
an increase in staffing. This development is 
expected to elevate the hospital's capacity to 
provide high-quality healthcare services and 
support the advanced training of medical 
professionals.
Experts say that if these improvements are 
done honestly, they will create an optimal 
environment for delivering superior healthcare 
services to the people of the Northern 
Province, marking a transformative step 
forward for the region.

Minister Douglas Devananda stated, 
"President Ranil was very keen on upgrading 
Jaffna Teaching Hospital to a national hospital. 
He asked me to submit a proposal in the last 
Cabinet meeting, which was endorsed by the 
President and approved by the Cabinet."
Professors from the Jaffna Medical Faculty 
acknowledged that the newly opened Clinical 
Training and Research Block is indeed a 
significant step forward for medical education 
and healthcare in the region. However, 
they also pointed out that the facility still 
faces substantial challenges due to a lack of 
basic amenities. They provided a detailed 
overview of the building's intended purposes, 
highlighting its potential to transform medical 
training and research. Despite this, the 
professors emphasized the need for additional 
resources and improvements to fully realize 
the facility's capabilities and address its current 
shortcomings.
The Clinical Training and Research Block was 
constructed with three main objectives, they 
said:
Undergraduate and Postgraduate Teaching: 
The primary purpose of the building 
is to facilitate clinical training for both 
undergraduate and postgraduate students. 
This includes MBBS students (student 
doctors), registrars, and senior registrars in 
surgical specialties. The training encompasses 
examining patients, performing procedures, 
and conducting various medical investigations. 
This hands-on experience is essential for 
developing competent medical professionals.
Service Delivery to the Public: The second goal 
is to enhance service delivery to patients. By 
performing surgeries and medical procedures, 
the aim is to reduce patient waiting times 
and alleviate overcrowding in hospitals. This 
improvement will increase patient comfort and 
streamline the healthcare process, benefiting</p>

both patients and the healthcare system.
Medical Research: The third objective is 
to facilitate medical research, contributing 
to advancements in medical science and 
healthcare practices.
However, professors pointed out that despite 
the significant investment of over LKR 900 
million, the building currently lacks the 
necessary facilities. They emphasized that it 
is essentially just a physical structure at this 
stage, as the government has not yet provided 
the funds required for essential furnishings 
and medical instruments. An additional 
allocation of around LKR 150 million is 
needed to fully operationalize the building. 
They told the Jaffna Monitor that this crucial 
funding shortfall must be addressed to ensure 
the facility can effectively meet its intended 
purposes.
Current Challenges and Priorities
Furniture and Basic Equipment: The first 
priority is to acquire furniture such as chairs, 
tables, and cupboards for staff, students, and 
medical practitioners.
Day Surgical Unit: A day surgical unit is being 
built where patients can undergo surgeries in 
the morning and return home by evening. This 
will be the first such unit in the government 
sector in Sri Lanka. The benefits include 
improved patient comfort, reduced hospital 
overcrowding, and increased staff motivation. 
To establish this unit, professors explained 
that theater instruments, laparoscopic and 
endoscopic equipment, anesthetic instruments, 
beds, monitors, and cardiac monitors are 
needed.
Advanced Reproductive Technology (ART) 
Theater Complex: This facility will provide 
advanced infertility treatments like IVF, 
making them accessible to economically 
disadvantaged patients. This will be the first 
government sector ART center in Sri Lanka, 
offering treatments typically costing LKR 1.5 
to 2 million.
Laboratories and Diagnostic Facilities:
Plans include building laboratories for blood 
investigations, endoscopic procedures, 
mammograms for early breast cancer 
detection, neurological investigations, 
andrology investigations (such as seminal 
fluid analysis), and vascular investigations. 
Additionally, ultrasound machines and 
digital histology equipment are needed. These 
facilities will enhance diagnostic capabilities 
and allow for advanced genetic testing, such as 
karyotyping and molecular tests.
Long-Term Vision
Achieving these priorities will enable the 
provision of excellent service to the public 
and deliver high-quality clinical education 
to undergraduate and postgraduate students. 
In the long run, this unit aims to become a 
center of excellence, offering free services to 
the public and promoting health tourism. This 
initiative is expected to attract the diaspora 
and generate revenue that can be reinvested 
into the hospital, ultimately benefiting the 
local population.
The professors concluded that while the 
building represents a great start, there is still a 
long way to go to realize its full potential and 
provide the intended benefits to the medical 
community and the public.</p>

T
he Tamil National People's Front (TNPF), true to 
its often confusing and aimless political stance, has 
called on Sri Lankan Tamils to boycott the upcoming 
presidential election. They argue that Tamils should 
refrain from voting until their aspirations are fulfilled. 
However, the TNPF has not provided any reasons 
or logic behind why they are still contesting in the 
parliamentary elections, nor why their President 
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam and Secretary-
General S. Kajendren are happily occupying their 
parliamentary seats.
"The Sri Lankan government views the Tamil 
homeland as an enemy," stated the TNPF in a rhetoric-
heavy yet logic-lacking announcement. "They continue 
their Buddhization, militarization, and structural 
genocide in our homeland. As long as the majority 
representation is in their hands, they will not consider 
Tamils as their people but as enemies. Therefore, the 
only option left to the Tamil people is to reject the 
presidential election," the TNPF declared.
Yet, how does this logic hold up during parliamentary 
elections? Does the Sri Lankan government suddenly 
view Tamils as close relations, making it okay for 
the TNPF to participate? The TNPF has provided no 
clarity on this glaring inconsistency.
Jaffna political observers quip, "Even if Ponnambalam's 
son pulls off Olympic-level somersaults, he won't land 
in the president's seat. So, the TNPF is flipping out of 
the presidential race. But hey, since there's a shot at 
making him an MP, they're all in for the parliamentary 
elections!
The TNPF, in their naive optimism, claimed that 
boycotting the elections would send a crystal-clear 
message to the government: the Tamils are stepping 
out of this electoral dance. How would this grand 
gesture resonate, or why would the government care 
about the Tamils boycotting or casting votes? Well, the 
TNPF left that part as mysterious as the strategy itself.
Switching gears in their marathon statement, the 
TNPF made a rather sensible point, highlighting that 
nearly half of Sri Lanka's salary budget is splurged on 
defence personnel, even with no active conflict. "The 
Security Forces are a colossal burden on the economy, 
but they refuse to admit it," their epic declaration 
noted.
