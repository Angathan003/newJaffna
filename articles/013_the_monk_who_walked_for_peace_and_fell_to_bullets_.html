The Monk Who Walked for 
Peace-And Fell to Bullets, 
Remembered in Jaffna
R
elatives of Rev. Yokotsuka Nobuyuki, the 
Japanese Buddhist monk who was tragically 
gunned down by Tamil militants in Jaffna 41 years 
ago, recently returned to the very place where 
his life was cut short. Joined by fellow Japanese 
Buddhist monks, they gathered on Mathews Street 
near St. Mary’s Cathedral—the exact spot where he 
was assassinated on March 2, 1984—for a solemn 
remembrance ceremony. With prayers echoing

through the very streets where he once walked 
for peace, the ceremony honored his legacy.
Rev. Yokotsuka, a 32-year-old disciple of 
Nichidatsu Fujii of the Nipponzan Myōhōji 
order, had been in Sri Lanka since the late 
1970s, dedicating himself to peace. Even as 
the ethnic conflict and the undeclared war 
escalated following the 1983 pogrom, when 
most Buddhist monks left Jaffna, he remained 
steadfast in his mission. Locals who still 
remember him told Jaffna Monitor that every 
day, he walked the streets of Jaffna, beating his 
handheld raban drum and chanting prayers 
for peace. Unlike many Buddhist monks in 
Sri Lanka, who receive alms at their temple 
doorstep, Rev. Yokotsuka lived humbly, 
walking the streets and relying on offerings 
from the public.
The Tragic End of a Peaceful Mission
As tensions grew, rumors spread that the 
Japanese monk was not who he claimed to be. 
Some in Jaffna believed he was a spy disguised 
as a monk. A local recalled advising him to 
leave for his safety, warning that militants 
might harm him. Yet, Rev. Yokotsuka was 
determined to continue his peace marches.
On March 2, 1984, as he walked through the 
streets, chanting and beating his raban drum, 
gunmen approached him. Witnesses recall 
a heartbreaking moment—upon seeing his 
attackers advance, he bowed deeply, a gesture 
of reverence rooted in the teachings of the 
Never Despising Bodhisattva from the Lotus 
Sutra, which emphasizes the Buddha nature 
within all beings. Seconds later, gunshots rang 
out.
Eyewitnesses found him lying on the roadside 
and rushed him to the hospital, but he could 
not be saved.
Who Killed Rev. Yokotsuka?
Responsibility for the assassination has long</p>

been attributed to Tamil militants. While 
multiple armed groups operated in Jaffna 
at the time-such as LTTE, TELO, PLOTE, 
and EPRLF-the widely accepted account is 
that LTTE gunmen carried out the killing. 
Although the LTTE never officially claimed 
responsibility (as they often avoided public 
acknowledgment of attacks on foreign 
nationals or clergy), reports from that time 
strongly suggest their involvement.
Japanese historical records explicitly state that 
LTTE cadres assassinated Rev. Yokotsuka. 
At the time, the LTTE was emerging as the 
dominant guerrilla force in Jaffna, known 
for its ruthless suppression of perceived 
opponents.
The assassination caused a major uproar in Sri 
Lanka’s southern media, where it was framed 
as the brutal killing of a peaceful Buddhist 
monk by Tamil militants. The Catholic 
Bishops’ Conference of Sri Lanka condemned 
the act, calling it a “sacrilegious shooting of an 
innocent person.”
Insider Accounts Confirm LTTE’s Role
Credible sources within the LTTE, who were 
in Jaffna at the time, told Jaffna Monitor that 
the order to assassinate Rev. Yokotsuka came 
directly from Captain Pandithar, a childhood 
friend of Prabhakaran and the overall 
commander of LTTE forces across all districts. 
According to these sources, the individual 
who carried out the attack was later killed in 
an ambush in Achchuveli, an attack that also 
claimed Pandithar’s life.
During this period, many LTTE members 
were still undergoing training in India. Those 
who had completed their training lacked 
firearms, as the LTTE’s first arms shipment-
largely funded by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister 
M.G. Ramachandran-arrived only in October 
1984. A former LTTE member recalled that 
some cadres returned to Sri Lanka armed 
only with machetes, as they had no access to 
firearms at the time.</p>
