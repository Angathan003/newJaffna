Niththilan (name changed), a former United 
Nations worker of immense bravery, witnessed 
the harrowing final stages of Sri Lanka's war in 
2009. As one of the few remaining individuals 
who can testify to the atrocities committed 
by both the Sri Lankan government and the 
LTTE, Niththilan played a critical role during 
this period.
In September 2008, following the directive to 
evacuate UN and international humanitarian 
organizations from LTTE-controlled 
territories, he was appointed as the officer 
in charge of all UN operations in the region.

controlled areas, he directed local staff in 
the absence of his international colleagues. 
Currently residing in Europe, Niththilan 
has chosen to break his silence and share his 
experiences with 'Jaffna Monitor' under the 
condition of anonymity.
How did you manage to escape from 
the LTTE that night?
Our journey began sometime between 1:30 
and 2:00 AM. It was a spine-chilling journey 
indeed. I carried my child as I walked, with my 
team following closely behind me. The night 
was dark, and the air was thick with tension 
and fear. Every step we took was cautious, as 
we knew the dangers that lurked around us. 
In Nandikadal, the battlefield was scarred by 
the relentless shelling, leaving behind massive 
craters. As we made our way through the 
treacherous terrain, my daughter and I fell into 
one such crater—a vast pit about 15-20 feet 
deep. The shock of the fall was overwhelming, 
but I managed to escape because I knew how 
to swim, pulling my daughter to safety.
Following this, my close friend Luckumar, a 
former Sewa Lanka Foundation worker who 
accompanied us, went ahead and instructed 
others to follow him. He played a crucial role 
in our escape from the LTTE-controlled area. 
Luckumar was instrumental in negotiating 
a deal with the Tigers guarding the defense 
position.
We bribed the fighters guarding one 
checkpoint and managed to pass through their 
area to reach the sea. However, with multiple 
checkpoints nearby, we constantly feared 
being shot by guards at another checkpoint. 
Thankfully, they did not shoot.
By around 4:30 AM, we reached the vicinity 
of the army area and loudly declared ourselves 
as United Nations personnel. An army officer 
called out my name, asking, "Are you Mr. ...?" 
To my surprise, he continued, "Welcome, sir. 
We have been waiting for you for the past 
three days. Unfortunately, we can't open the 
gate right now. Please wait until 6 AM." So, we 
waited near the shore. I later learned that my 
office in Vavuniya had informed them of our 
arrival.
Knowing that we, the United Nations 
personnel, had escaped, the Tigers launched 
their fiercest shell attack around 5:30 AM. 
They targeted us ruthlessly, not just with shells 
but also with RCL and RPG guns. Shells fell 
very close to us. Having crossed the dangerous 
Nandikadal, I believed we were about to be 
killed on the shore in the Tigers' shelling. 
Terrified, we all buried our heads in the sand. 
Along with us, hundreds of people who had 
escaped that night were on the shore, all 
waiting to enter the army-controlled area at 
dawn.
In retaliation, the army conducted a fierce 
shelling attack from their tanks towards the 
LTTE-controlled area, particularly targeting 
the spots where the shells had come from. 
Sadly, I believe many people in the LTTE-
controlled area must have been killed by the 
army's retaliatory fire.
How can you be sure that the Tigers targeted 
only the escaping United Nations personnel?
I can confirm it based on the timing of the 
attack. They attacked in anger upon realizing 
that the last UN team had escaped their 
control.
What happened next?

opened the gate before 6 AM and let us into 
their controlled area. An officer, a Lieutenant 
Colonel, came to welcome us. He mentioned 
they had been waiting for us for three days. 
Indeed, we had been trying to escape for 
the previous three days but couldn't. They 
welcomed us and provided us with bread and 
fish curry, which was a luxurious meal for 
us, as we hadn't seen such food in about five 
months.
The military officer approached me with 
evident discomfort and said, "I'm sorry, sir. 
We are compelled to conduct a strip search. 
I deeply regret this necessity." He explained 
that a month before, in Vishvamadu, amidst 
innocent civilians, a female suicide bomber 
had detonated, claiming numerous lives. 
"Since that harrowing event, we've instituted 
a stringent entry protocol that includes a 
complete strip search," he added. He further 
explained that men and women would be 
searched separately, and everyone would be 
searched alone. I responded, "If that's the 
procedure, proceed as such." But deep inside, I 
felt humiliated.
Post-search, we were provided military jeeps 
to reach Thevipuram School. While others 
were processed quickly and sent to camps 
in Vavuniya, our group experienced an 
unexpected delay. Curious about the holdup, 
I inquired and was informed that someone of 
significant stature was en route to meet me.
By around 12:30 PM, the scene transformed 
dramatically. Two armored vehicles rolled in, 
flanked by a convoy of security motorcycles 
and vehicles, signaling the arrival of a high-
ranking official from the Sri Lankan military. 
Stepping out amidst the security detail, this 
tall, imposing figure approached me directly, 
asking my name with a stern but focused 
demeanor.

In a not-so-surprising turn of events, Wanindu 
Hasaranga has decided to step down as the 
captain of the Sri Lankan Men's T20I team. 
Despite facing criticism for his leadership during 
the team's early and disappointing exit from 
the T20 World Cup, Hasaranga's resignation 
letter to Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Ashley De Silva 
emphasized his unwavering commitment to the 
team as a player.
Hasaranga, known for his fiery and often 
controversial 
demeanor 
on 
the 
field, 
acknowledged that his intense attitude has 
sometimes led to disciplinary issues and

Hasaranga's Exit: 
The Captaincy, The Apologies, and 
the Unwanted Wisdom

misunderstandings. However, he offered a 
philosophy that might make even a few yogis 
raise an eyebrow: "I have at all times expressed 
emotion on the field, and such an attitude has 
helped me overcome challenges and inspire 
myself to do better. This is in no way aimed to 
offend anyone," he said, yet showing gentlemanly 
conduct by offering sincere apologies to anyone 
who might have been offended by his remarks 
made in frustration.
The all-rounder's resignation comes after a 
disappointing performance at the recent T20 
World Cup, where Sri Lanka's early exit left fans 
and the team disheartened—and, of course, 
angry. Reflecting on the campaign, Hasaranga 
admitted, "Sri Lanka's early exit at the T20 
World Cup is extremely disappointing to me as 
the Captain and for the entire team."
In his resignation, Hasaranga took full 
responsibility for the team's performance, 
expressing regret for not delivering better 
results. "The team and I have let our country 
down," he stated, apologizing to the nation and 
Sri Lanka Cricket. He emphasized his intention 
to continue serving the team as a player, aiming 
to focus on his individual performance. "I feel 
my performances at my peak were extremely 
helpful to bring about victories to our nation," 
he said, vowing to maintain high standards and 
support the team in any capacity.
Predictably, Sri Lanka Cricket has accepted 
Hasaranga's resignation and acknowledged 
his continued importance to the team's 
international strategies. The board emphasized 
that Hasaranga will remain a pivotal player 
whose contributions to the field are invaluable.</p>
