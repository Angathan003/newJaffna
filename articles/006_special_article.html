A
ccording to the World Bank's latest report, Sri Lanka's 
economic growth rate is expected to reach 3.5% this 
year, consistent with the October forecast, but challenges 
from high US tariffs and high poverty rates cannot be 
ignored. President Dissanayake stated that measures 
have been taken to minimize the impact of US tariffs on 
the domestic economy. Building a strong economy that 
will not be shaken by any economic storm is one of the 
government's top priorities.
Given the disparity between economic development levels 
and economic strength, the US tariff policy will further 
widen the gap between rich and poor countries, with 
less developed countries suffering a greater impact. As 
one of the countries most affected, Sri Lanka's right to 
development has been severely undermined, and its already 
fragile economy will be further strained, with a particularly 
severe impact on the export sector. As Sri Lanka's economic 
pillar industry and the second-largest source of foreign 
exchange earnings, the garment industry has experienced a 
sharp decline in orders and a reduction in garment export 
revenue, with export values potentially decreasing by 20%

Then — and Now

and threatening tens of thousands of jobs in 
related industries. Previously, garment factories 
in Sri Lanka had already canceled Sinhalese 
and Tamil New Year bonuses, triggering labor 
disputes and leading to widespread factory 
shutdowns. Other export industries, such as 
rubber and plastic products, tea, and gems, may 
also suffer negative impacts due to the tariffs. 
In addition, the decline in exports will lead to 
a reduction in Sri Lanka's foreign exchange 
earnings, depreciation of the rupee, increased 
import prices, and exacerbated inflation, 
affecting its macroeconomic stability and 
foreign debt repayment capacity, and slowing 
economic growth.
Globally, the United States, disregarding 
the balance of interests achieved through 
multilateral trade negotiations, and under the 
guise of so-called "reciprocity" and "fairness," 
uses tariff as a weapon to exert maximum 
pressure for its own selfish gains and subverting 
the existing international economic and trade 
order. This unilateralism and hegemonic 
bullying have severely impacted the global 
economic order and the multilateral trading 
system, and seriously harmed the interests 
and well-being of all countries. Ostensibly, 
this is done in the name of "protecting 
domestic industries" and "reshaping supply 
chain security," but in reality, it continues the 
traditional approach of politicizing economic 
and trade issues, bringing unprecedented 
difficulties and challenges to multilateralism 
and global economic recovery.
Looking back at history, this bullying behavior 
by the United States seems somewhat familiar. 
In the early 1950s, when China had just been 
founded, its development was severely hindered 
due to the Western countries' embargo and 
blockade. To survive and develop, China 
urgently needed to import various materials, 
including rubber. At this time, under the 
control of the United States, rubber prices 
plummeted, while rice prices soared. This 
caused severe economic difficulties for Ceylon, 
which depended on rubber exports and rice 
imports. However, China and Sri Lanka broke 
through numerous obstacles and signed the 
historically significant Rubber-Rice Pact, 
opening the door to friendly relations between 
the two countries. To retaliate against Ceylon's 
trade with China, the United States invoked the 
Battle Act, halting aid to Ceylon and the supply 
of sulfur needed for rubber plantations.
Now, the United States is once again placing 
its own interests above the common interests 
of the international community, provoking a 
new round of tariff and trade wars. In response, 
China has made it clear: "We have made it very 
clear that China does not look for a war, but 
neither are we afraid of it. We will fight, if fight 
we must. Our doors are open, if the U.S. wants 
to talk." The reason China firmly says no to 
US hegemony is that history and reality have 
repeatedly told the world that appeasement 
cannot bring peace, and compromise does not 
lead to respect. Seeking so-called exemptions 
by harming the interests of others for the sake 
of one's own selfish and short-term gains is 
as futile - and dangerous - as bargaining with 
a tiger for its own skin, and will ultimately 
lead to losses on both sides, harming others 
without benefiting oneself. China's standing 
up is not only to safeguard its own legitimate 
rights and interests but also to protect the 
common interests of the international 
community, including the vast number of small 
and medium-sized countries, and to defend 
international fairness and justice.
Economic globalization is an unstoppable 
historical trend, and multilateralism is the 
inevitable choice for addressing difficulties and 
challenges. Like many developing countries, 
China is a defender, contributor, promoter, 
and beneficiary of multilateralism, economic 
globalization, and free trade. In the face of a 
complex and volatile world situation, China's 
contribution to global economic growth has 
remained at around 30% for many years, and 
it has been an important engine of world</p>

economic growth. China firmly upholds 
the rules-based multilateral trading system, 
promotes trade and investment liberalization 
and facilitation, and works to make the "pie" of 
common development bigger.
Amidst change and continuity, the friendship 
between China and Sri Lanka has withstood the 
tests of time and remains one of good friends, 
good brothers, and good partners. Over the 
years,with China's participation and support, a 
large number of infrastructure and livelihood 
assistance projects have been completed, 
involving various fields such as ports, highways, 
water affairs, electricity, and healthcare, 
significantly improving its infrastructure 
and investment environment while boosting 
local employment,strongly supporting Sri 
Lanka's economic and social development and 
bringing tangible benefits to the Sri Lankan 
people. China-Sri Lanka economic and trade 
cooperation has achieved rapid development, 
with the Colombo Port City and Hambantota 
Port are landmark projects of the Belt and 
Road invested by China, being successfully 
constructed and steadily advancing, becoming 
two engines of Sri Lanka's economic 
development.
In January of this year, President Dissanayake 
visited China for the first time since taking 
office, holding the dual titles of "the first foreign 
head of state to visit China in the New Year" 
and "the new President of Sri Lanka." During 
his meeting with President Dissanayake, 
Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that 
China-Sri Lanka relations faces a historic 
opportunity to build on past achievements and 
open up the future. Both sides should grasp 
China-Sri Lanka relations from a strategic 
height and jointly build a China-Sri Lanka 
community of shared destiny.Following their 
talks, the two heads of state jointly witnessed 
the signing of several cooperation documents 
in such areas as Belt and Road cooperation, 
agricultural products, social welfare, and the 
press, radio and television.In the joint statement 
issued by China and Sri Lanka, cooperation 
in various fields such as economy and trade, 
agriculture, climate change, and education was 
detailed, from the landmark projects of jointly 
building the "Belt and Road" to Sri Lankan 
tea, making the "Working drawing" for China-
Sri Lanka's practical cooperation clearer. In 
the face of the United States' use of tariffs to 
implement hegemonism and power politics, 
China has stated its readiness to support Sri 
Lanka's development and strengthen the long-
term partnership between the two countries 
to address global trade tensions. China-Sri 
Lanka relations are a model of South-South 
cooperation, and the two countries are fully 
capable of building a shared future based on 
mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, and stable 
development.
Justice will prevail, while injustice is doomed to 
fail. The US is waging a tariff war, in defiance 
of global criticism, is pitching itself against the 
rest of the world. Unity brings strength, and 
cooperation leads to mutual success.Currently, 
changes in the world, times, and history are 
unfolding in unprecedented ways, and the 
world is entering a new period of turbulence 
and change. Faced with the rise of unilateralism 
and protectionism, China has both the courage 
to say no and the determination to match its 
words with actions, as well as the confidence to 
win. Faced with a turbulent world, Sri Lanka 
should more firmly safeguard its own legitimate 
rights and interests, believe that China is a 
more trustworthy partner,follow the historical 
trend of peace and development, and resist 
the undercurrents of geopolitical and bloc 
confrontation, as well as the countercurrents 
of unilateralism and protectionism. The two 
countries should safeguard peace, pursue 
development, and achieve shared prosperity, 
so as to make solid progress in building the 
China-Sri Lanka community with a shared 
future in the new era, and bring greater stability 
and certainty to this turbulent world.</p>
