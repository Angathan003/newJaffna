Social Cohesion and the Challenge 
of Managing a Multi-Ethnic, 
Plural Sri Lanka
Special  Article
BY:  Jeevan Thiagarajah
Former Governor Northern Province/
Former Member Commissioner 
Election Commission.
Introduction
Socially cohesive societies are better poised for stability 
and growth, with a general sense of satisfaction and trust 
in both inter-community and intra-community relations. 
These characteristics are a scaffolding for a harmonious 
society and a prerequisite for both economic success as 
well as a functioning democracy. Social cohesion is an 
important determinant of a peaceful, democratic and 
prosperous nation. It creates stronger bonds within and 
across different groups, and fosters greater trust in the</p>

institutions of government. Reinforcing or 
promoting social cohesion thus is an integral 
part of government policy and civil society 
engagement in countries where multiple 
identity groups share geographic space. It is 
even more important where there is a history 
or current context of conflict, hostility, or 
mistrust between different identity groups or 
the state and its citizens as in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>Targeted population
Across the country, poor citizens, the 
unbanked, landless, differently abled, 
seeking Access to Justice, threatened due 
to religious their beliefs, women seeking 
access to sustainable means to a livelihood, 
deriving benefits from conflict sensitive 
development assistance, included in socially 
cohesive pluralistic communities without 
discrimination, benefiting from early 
intervention preventing violent extremism and 
protected by state aided services.
Theory of Change 
IF communities have increased opportunities 
to interact meaningfully across divides, 
including through activities that increase 
their ability to peacefully conduct livelihoods 
activities and decrease competition for 
resources, THEN they will increase inter-
group understanding; IF communities have 
opportunities to address conflict drivers 
related to access to and management of state 
services and natural resources, THEN they will 
be less likely to compete for scarce resources 
and more likely to live together peacefully. 
IF communities have an opportunity to 
share their frustrations and concerns with 
government officials and other leaders, and 
if leaders listen and take meaningful action, 
THEN relationships will improve between 
communities and leaders, and among leaders. 
IF formal and informal institutions can 
efficiently and effectively respond to the needs 
of society, THEN people will rely on these 
institutions rather than resorting to violence. 
IF security and justice institutions protected 
everyone and enforced laws equitably and 
protected all human rights, THEN the extent 
of core grievance would decline.
The preamble sets out the logic of aiming for a 
cohesive society in Sri Lanka. It goes onto pick 
elements from independence to more recent 
political recommendations.

INDEPENDENCE ORDER IN COUNCIL, 
1047, AND ACTS NOS. 29 OF 1954, 35 OF 
1954, AND 36 OF 1954.]
LEGISLATIVE POWERS AND PROCEDURE
Power of Parliament to make laws. <br />
29.</p>
<p>(1) Subject to the provisions 
of this Order, Parliament shall have 
power to make laws for the peace, 
order and good government of the 
Island.</p>
<p>(2) No such law shall-</p>
<p>(a) prohibit or restrict the free 
exercise of any religion ; or</p>
<p>(b) make persons of any 
community or religion liable to 
disabilities or restrictions to which 
persons of other communities or 
religions are not made liable ; or</p>
<p>(c) confer on persons of any 
community or religion any privilege 
or advantage which is not conferred 
on persons of other communities or 
religions ; or
[ 2, 29 of 1954.]</p>
<p>(d) alter the constitution of any 
religious body except with the consent 
of the governing authority of that body, 
so, however, that in any case where 
a religious body is incorporated by 
law, no such alteration shall be made 
except at the request of the governing 
authority of that body :
1957- Bandaranaike - Chelvanayagam Pact 
-Recognition of Tamil as a national language, 
and that the administrative work of the 
Northern and Eastern Provinces should be 
done in Tamil. That the Northern Province is 
to form one regional area whilst the Eastern 
Province is to be divided into two or more 
regional areas. Further provision is to be 
made in the Bill for two or more regions to 
collaborate for specific purposes of common 
interests. The question of M.P.s representing 
districts falling within regional areas to be 
eligible to function as chairmen is to be 
considered. The question of Government 
Agents being regional commissioners is to 
be considered. The question of supervisory 
functions over larger towns, strategic towns 
and municipalities is to be looked into. 
Parliament is to delegate powers and to specify 
them in the Act. It was agreed that regional 
councils should have powers over specified 
subjects including agriculture, co-operatives, 
lands and land development, colonization, 
education, health, industries and fisheries, 
housing and social services, electricity, water 
schemes and roads. Requisite definition of 
powers will be made in the Bill. It was agreed 
that in the matter of colonization schemes 
the powers of the regional councils shall 
include the power to select allottees to whom 
lands within their area of authority shall be 
alienated and also power to select personnel 
to be employed for work on such schemes. 
The position regarding the area at present 
administered by the Gal Oya Board in this 
matter requires consideration.  The Central 
Government will provide block grants to the 
regional councils. The principles on which the</p>

grants will be computed will be gone into. The 
regional councils shall have powers of taxation 
and borrowing.
1965-Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam 
Pact - Action will be taken early under the 
Tamil Language Special Provisions Act to 
make provision of the Tamil Language to be 
the language of Administration and of Record 
in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Mr. 
Senanayake explained that it was the policy of 
his party that a Tamil-speaking person should 
be entitled to transact business in Tamil 
throughout the island. Mr. Senanayake stated 
that it was the policy of his party to amend 
the Language of Courts. Act to provide for 
legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces to be conducted and recorded 
in Tamil. Action will be taken to establish 
District Councils in Ceylon vested with 
powers over subjects to be mutually agreed 
upon between two leaders. It was agreed, 
however, that the government should have 
power under the law to give directions to such 
councils under the national interest. The Land 
Development Ordinance will be amended to 
provide that citizens of Ceylon be entitled to 
the allotment of land under the Ordinance. 
Mr. Senanayake further agreed that in the 
granting of land under colonisation schemes 
the following priorities be observed in the 
Northern and Eastern provinces:(a) Land in 
the Northern and Eastern provinces should 
in the first instance be granted to landless 
persons in the district, (b) Secondly, to Tamil-
speaking persons resident in the Northern and 
Eastern provinces, (c) Thirdly, to other citizens 
in Ceylon, preference being given to Tamil 
residents in the rest of the island.
The Mangala Moonesinghe Parliamentary 
Select Committee -The so-called ‘Option 
Paper’ presented to the committee by Mr. 
Moonesinghe proposed the creation of a 
Northeast Regional Council with specified 
powers and a single governor. The regional 
council was to consist of all members of 
separate Northern and Eastern Provincial 
Councils which would sit independently to 
consider other areas of government. The chief 
ministers of the respective provinces would 
alternate as chief minister of the region. While 
the Option Paper was rejected by the Tamil 
parties, it was, at least by Sri Lankan standards, 
a creative attempt to bridge the gap between 
the various parliamentary parties. 
The Interim report of the Moonesinghe 
select committee -The interim report of 
the parliamentary select committee was 
released in January 1993. While the report</p>

was not endorsed by the Tamil parties, it 
contained the ‘matters agreed upon by a 
majority of members’. These   included: 1. 
the establishment of two separate units of 
administration for the Northern and Eastern 
provinces; 2. the adoption of a scheme of 
devolution on lines similar to those obtaining 
in the Indian constitution (India’s Union 
Government retains powers to dissolve state 
assemblies, dismiss state governments and 
impose presidential rule); 3. The devolution 
of more powers in List III (Concurrent List) 
of the 13th amendment, or the wholesale 
elimination of the List. 
The PA Approach -In her address to 
the nation on 3 August 1995, President 
Kumaratunga declared: ‘The aspiration of 
the entire Sri Lankan populace is that the 
current national crisis centred around the 
north and east be brought to a peaceful, 
just and honourable settlement ... The first 
task is ... a new approach predicated on 
unqualified acceptance of the fact that the 
Tamil people have genuine grievances for 
which solutions must be found.  ‘With this 
objective in view, the government is seeking 
to rebuild the constitutional foundation of a 
plural society within a united and sovereign 
Republic of Sri Lanka. This republic will be 
a Union of Regions. This  exercise is based 
on the following principles: An effective 
constitutional framework for devolution of 
power to regions based on credibility, clarity, 
and   an internally consistent and coherent 
value system, which is capable of effective 
implementation and includes structures for 
the just resolution of centre-region disputes; <br />
To encourage the regions and communities 
which inhabit them to become constructive 
partners  of a  stable and pluralistic 
democracy; To ensure that all persons may 
fully and effectively exercise all their human 
rights and fundamental freedoms without</p>

any discrimination and in full equality before 
the law; To give recognition to Sinhala and 
Tamil as official languages, to accord equality 
of status to these languages, and to recognize 
English as a link language;  •  To protect the 
identity of distinct communities and create 
conditions for the promotion of that identity, 
including the right to enjoy their own culture, 
profess and practice their own   religion, and 
nurture and promote their own language, 
and to transact business with the state  in the 
national language of  their choice.’ 
The legal draft was discussed in parliamentary 
committee for nearly two years, with little 
prospect of consensus. 
In October 1997, the government took a 
unilateral decision to re-publish its provisions, 
amended and incorporated in a completely 
revised draft constitution. Within this 
new format, the 'foremost place' accorded 
Buddhism was retained.  One constructive 
feature of the draft constitution was its 
proposal that the powers of an inter-regional 
chief ministers’ conference be expanded to 
mediate disputes not only within regional 
administrations, but also between the regions 
and central government. In an attempt to 
address concerns about the possible abuse 
of the president’s powers to dissolve regional 
councils, the draft constitution also proposed 
a specially convened tribunal to adjudicate 
on the legitimacy of any dissolutions. Such 
a tribunal would comprise a presidential 
nominee, a nominee of the regional chief 
minister concerned and a third member, 
jointly selected by the two nominees. 
In a dramatic swing away from majoritarian 
centralism, the draft constitution granted 
the regions veto power over constitutional 
amendments affecting either the chapter on 
devolution or the two schedules spelling out 
regional parameters and the division of powers 
between different tiers of government.<br />
All Party Representative Committee 
(APRC)-2006  -President Rajapaksa convened 
an All Party Representatives Conference to 
make recommendations on Constitutional 
Reform allowing maximum devolution 
enabling “people  in their own localities 
take charge of the destiny and control their 
politico-economic environment and social-
economic advancement without over- reliance 
on the Centre”.  He also appointed an expert 
panel to formulate Constitutional reform 
options that would guide the APRC in its 
deliberations and recommendations. 
Initially twelve members were appointed to 
the panel. The membership was later increased 
to fifteen and subsequently to seventeen. Of 
these eleven endorsed one report described 
as the “majority” report (was multi – ethnic 
in composition with six Sinhala, four Tamil 
and one Muslim representative. All three 
women experts too had signed it). Four 
others presented another “minority” report.</p>

Two others submitted a “dissenting” report 
each. The other three reports were signed by 
Sinhala persons. While the majority report 
was ready to propose maximum devolution 
the other reports were not prepared to go that 
far. The main issues of contention dividing the 
majority report and other dissenting reports 
were over matters like maximum devolution 
amounting to quasi – federalism, unitary state 
and retaining the salient points of the 13th 
Constitutional amendment. 
The majority report recommended that Sri 
Lanka should be known as “Republic of 
Sri Lanka” without specifying whether it 
should be unitary or federal. The majority 
report proposed four different options in 
resolving the prickly issue of North – East 
linkage. Among other recommendations 
were proposals for power sharing at the 
centre, resolution of centre-province disputes 
and specific measures to ensure territorial 
integrity and prevent secession. The majority 
report recommended that Local Government 
be constitutionally recognized as a tier of 
government.<br />
India showed keen interest in the working 
of the Expert panel and provided much 
documentation including the Sarkaria 
Commission report on Centre – State relations 
it is known. The APRC had representatives 
from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, United 
National Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, 
Jathika Hela Urumaya , Sri Lanka Muslim 
Congress, National Unity Alliance, 
Ceylon Workers Congress, Mahajana 
Eksath Peramuna Lanka Sama Samaja 
Party, Communist Party of Sri Lanka, All 
Ceylon Muslim League, and Eelam Peoples 
Democratic Party. National Muslim Congress, 
Up Country People’s Front and Western 
Peoples Front (now DPF). 
The inability of the Expert panel to define a 
framework of fundamental values for resolving 
the national problems and present a coherent 
set of options in respect of the key issues was a 
missed opportunity.<br />
Highlights of the Majority Committee Report:<br />
Sri Lanka will not be defined as unitary or 
federal. 2.  Every one of the constituent peoples 
of Sri Lanka will have the right to internal self- 
determination. 3.  The Constitution will have a 
comprehensive Bill of Rights. Group rights will 
be   recognized. Section 29(2) of the Soulbury 
Constitution will be included. 4.  Powers will 
be devolved on Provinces which will be the 
units of devolution. There will be Provincial 
Legislatures and Provincial Governments. 
5.  Four options have been given with regard 
to the issue of the merger of the North 
and East to a single Province. One option 
is for a permanent merger with internally 
autonomous units for Muslim and Sinhala 
minorities. Another option is for a temporary 
merger with a referendum in the East at the</p>

end of 10 years. 6.  The Tamils of Indian 
origin will have an internally autonomous 
Zonal Council within the Central Province 
and a Cultural Council recognised by the 
Constitution. 7.  There will be 4 Lists for the 
assignment of subjects and functions, namely, 
National,   Provincial, Concurrent and Local 
Authorities. The subjects in the Concurrent 
List   will be deemed to be Provincial subjects 
for the North-East while the other Provinces 
will be able to have them as concurrent at the

them to provincial subjects. 8.  Sri Lanka will 
have a President and two Vice Presidents, 
each belonging to a different community. 
9.  There will be a Senate with the Senators 
elected by the Provincial Legislatures. One of 
the Vice Presidents will be the Chairman of 
the Senate. 10.  Sinhala and Tamil will have 
parity of status as the official languages of Sri

the judicial hierarchy. This Court will  <br />
adjudicate on matters of interpretation 
of the Constitution, and the legality 
of laws before or after enactment. The 
Court will also adjudicate on executive 
actions of   the President.
Conclusions
In the absence of armed civil strife of 
the kind seen up to May 2009 there 
may be little political incentive for 
parties at the centre to recognise and 
or go the extent seen in the past as proposals 
for accommodation of diverse segments 
of society. However, the Foreign Minister 
was heard to say in his recent address to 
58th UNHRC Session in Geneva, ‘Special 
attention has been paid to improving the 
socio-economic conditions and address 
critical needs such as resettlement, housing, 
compensation and infrastructure development 
in the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern 
Provinces. The Government has been actively 
working to develop infrastructure, support 
livelihoods and promote industries in the 
Northern and Eastern Provinces, aiming to 
enhance connectivity and support regional 
development. The Government led by 
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is 
firmly and sincerely committed to working 
towards a unified Sri Lanka that respects 
and celebrates the diversity of its people 
with no division or discrimination based 
on race, religion, class and caste. We will 
not leave room for a resurgence of divisive 
racism or religious extremism in our country. 
Every citizen should feel free to practice 
their religion, speak their language, and live 
according to their cultural values without fear</p>

or discrimination. No one should feel that 
their beliefs, culture, or political affiliations 
will make them targets of undue pressure 
or prejudice. Administrative, political and 
electoral processes will be activated towards 
this end. Domestic institutions such as the 
Office on Missing Persons (OMP), Office for 
Reparations, and Office for National Unity and 
Reconciliation (ONUR) will be strengthened. 
The contours of a truth and reconciliation 
framework, will be further discussed with the 
broadest possible cross section of stakeholders, 
before operationalization to ensure a process 
that has the trust of all Sri Lankans. Our 
aim is to make the domestic mechanisms 
credible and sound within the constitutional 
framework. This will include strengthening 
the work towards a truth and reconciliation 
commission empowered to investigate acts 
of violence caused by racism and religious 
extremism that give rise to tensions within Sri 
Lankan society’.
Much of what he has said have echoes with 
the past. Clearly the need has been long felt 
extending to beyond our pre independence 
period. Going forward there is need to ensure 
we have no recurrence of issues past leading 
to strife. The Government is well placed at 
present to set in place measures which prevent 
relapse of conflict or emergence of extremism. 
The menu of options drawing from historical 
narratives on the table to use is rich.</p>

Story
It is a deeply held superstition among 
the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora in 
Europe that an early morning call 
from Sri Lanka brings news of a 
death. Therefore, I always went to 
sleep with my cellphone turned off. 
Just as we do archanai in temples or 
conduct witchcraft cleansing in the 
hope of postponing the death of our 
loved ones, I developed the belief 
that turning off the cellphone would 
prevent death. A year ago, on just one

night, I forgot to turn off my cell phone before 
I went to bed. At four in the morning, it woke 
me up with a scream to convey news of appā’s 
death.
Appā was a man of warped thinking. My 
mother, who was filled to the brim with 
naivete, was like a hostage caught in the 
tentacles of a crazed extremist. But if I even 
frowned at appā or exchanged words with 
him, my ammā would rush to his defense. She 
would berate me, claiming that her husband 
possessed a treasured intellect and fearless 
bravery.
When they got married, appā had taken 
ammā to see the movie ‘anpē vā.’  During the 
interval, a young man in the movie theater had 
smiled at ammā. Since he was in her class till 
grade 5 – ammā went to school only till grade 
5 –, she had smiled back. Noticing this, appā 
had dragged ammā out of the theater, gave her 
a thundering slap in the middle of the street, 
and demanded to know who the man was. 
If this incident had ended then and there, I 
would have no need to tell you the story now. 
But even when he was eighty-one, just a few 
days before his death, he had slapped her, 
asking, “Who was it that grinned at you in the 
theater?” For fifty years, appā had been posing 
this question to her whenever it crossed his 
mind.
Despite his warped thinking, there is no 
doubt that he was effective at what he did. 
He traveled between Jaffna and Colombo for 
his tobacco brokerage business, slowly but 
steadily raising the economic status of our 
family. There were rumors that he engaged in 
some sort of fraud in his brokerage business. 
Even some lawsuits found their way to us. He 
bought a big empty plot of land in the middle 
of the village, turned it into a luscious coconut 
grove, and built a house. His first four children 
were girls. He had frugally saved enough 
money to marry them off. With his efforts and 
the natural beauty, they inherited from ammā, 
my sisters were quickly snapped up by grooms 
from abroad. My eldest sister Thilakā went to 
France and arranged a groom for my second 
elder sister Rōhiṇi. Their entire household 
was abuzz with celebrations to send her off to 
France. It was then that I ran away to join a 
militant group, turning the festive household 
into looking like a funerary one. My appā 
never forgave me for this misdeed.
When my youngest sister Vēṇi was leaving for 
France to get married, I was in prison. Vēṇi 
akkā came with ammā to visit me in Magazine 
prison before flying out. In those days, I 
could never even imagine being released from 
prison. Everyone said I would be sentenced 
to at least thirty years in prison. Did I not 
mention appā’s warped thinking? He did not 
visit me in prison even once. Once in a while 
ammā traveled from the village to see me, 
accompanied by some relative or the other.
Perhaps it was because of all the vows she 
made to deities in temple after temple, or 
perhaps it was because of the endless fasting 
she suffered through, I was released after 
seven years. As soon as I was released, my 
four sisters pooled money to pay for an agent 
to smuggle me into France. Once I arrived in 
France, they all told me in unison:
“Brother! We paid for your lawsuit for seven 
years. Now we have even brought you out 
of the country. We are not going to ask 
you to pay back all that money. But from 
now on, taking care of our parents is your 
responsibility.”
I came to France at twenty-seven years of age 
after souring on the militant movement and 
the Tamil struggle. While I was in prison, my 
militant group completely abandoned me. It 
was my family that protected me and rescued</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

82
me from prison. I resolved to spend the rest 
of my life for the welfare of my family and 
began to work hard.
Five years after I came to France, I had saved 
enough money to pay for an agent to bring 
my parents to France. My sisters were also 
very keen to bring them over. But my appā, he 
of warped thinking, refused to move abroad. 
He declared firmly, “I cannot live a debased 
refugee life like you all. If you want, you can 
take your ammā abroad!” There is no need to 
explain that ammā would never travel alone 
without appā. It was with the savings intended 
to bring them that I paid an agent to bring 
my cousin Sevvanthi to France and married 
her. That was the only smart thing that I ever 
did in my entire life. In marriage ceremonies, 
people vow to never part ‘in sickness and in 
health’ as a mere formality. But my cousin 
Sevvanthi has stuck religiously to the letter 
and spirit of that vow.
When appā died some distant relative</p>

had to light his pyre. Those of us who had 
the obligation to light his pyre, I and my 
sisters, were living as refugees in France. 
We no longer had Sri Lankan passports. The 
temporary refugee passports given to us by 
the French government explicitly said <Not 
permitted to travel to Sri Lanka>. Even 
after siring five children, appā died like 
an abandoned old man with no offspring. 
Ammā was now eighty. Various maladies, 
the inevitable fruits of old age, had taken her 
over completely. Anxious that the same fate as 
appā’s would befall ammā, I turned off my cell 
phone at night before going to bed.
But bad news found its way to me during 
the day. My eldest sister called me on my 
cellphone to say that ammā had been admitted 
to the General Hospital in Jaffna after being 
bitten by a snake that was hiding inside a pot. 
I called ammā’s cell phone immediately. The 
first thing ammā told me from her hospital bed 
was that I should bring her over to France.
We the children had begun to ponder this 
possibility right after appā passed away. But 
the various practical difficulties involved had 
stopped us on our tracks. It had remained 
a mere possibility. But now ammā herself 
requested it explicitly. Tell me, how can my 
uneducated ammā, not wise in the ways of the 
world, comprehend the practical difficulties 
that you yourself would struggle to understand 
fully!
We as refugees cannot sponsor her to come to 
France. The only way left to us was to use an 
agent to bring her here illegally. There was no 
other way. But how could we subject ammā 
to an illegal journey at her advanced age? She 
would need to cross icy deserts and frozen 
rivers on foot. Or she would need to travel 
by air on a stolen passport or a fake visa. If 
she got caught en route, she would be thrown 
into prison. My eldest brother-in-law made 
a suggestion. Let us try for a tourist visa for 
ammā. If she gets it, she could travel to France 
and then register as a refugee.
Since I had been given the entire responsibility 
for taking care of ammā, I made all the 
necessary arrangements. Once ammā had 
recovered, she went to Colombo with an 
acquaintance and applied for a tourist visa 
at the French embassy. At the interview, 
the embassy visa officer had asked just one 
question:
“You are a senior. I don’t want to waste your 
time by making you run around. We can give 
you a three-month visa. But what guarantee is 
there that you would return to Sri Lanka after 
three months?”
I had anticipated this question. Therefore, 
I had warned ammā about it before the 
interview. Therefore, ammā responded to the 
question saying, “I have land and a house in 
my village. I would not overstay in France, 
abandoning them.”
The visa officer countered, “Lots of houses 
and land lie abandoned in Jaffna district. Their 
owners went to Canada and Europe but never 
returned,” and rejected ammā’s application for 
a visa.
My reaction to the rejection was to be furious 
at ammā. If appā and ammā had agreed to 
come to France fifteen years ago, when I first 
invited them, it would have been perfect. Then 
ammā had the strength to undertake a journey 
that involved crossing borders illegally. It was 
also not difficult to come here. A lot of people 
boarded planes in Colombo holding fake visas 
arranged by agents and requested political 
asylum as soon as they landed in Paris airport. 
At that time, France was accepting refugees 
without too much of a fuss because the civil 
war was raging in Sri Lanka. Now the civil</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

war has ended. Ripe old age and ill health has 
taken over ammā. She takes fifteen different 
tablets every day. How many more years could 
she survive the cold and snow in France? Even 
the banana tree that rejuvenates itself like a 
Phoenix every time it is cut down, could not 
survive in France’s climate. The Sri Lankan 
sun and the life in harmony with nature would 
give ammā a long life. I found different 
reasons to be angry, as a defense mechanism 
to deal with my inferiority complex arising 
from my inability to do anything for ammā.
But ammā was firm in her desire to come to 
France. I really could not challenge any of the 
reasons she had for this desire.
“Listen carefully son! This village has been 
a wasteland for years. Snakes and creepy 
crawlies and rabid dogs rule the roost here. 
Every house in the village, save barely ten, lies 
in a dilapidated state. People who escaped the 
village during the war never returned. There 
is no one within a half-a-kilometer radius of 
our house. There is no electricity at night, only 
occasionally during the day. How can a sick 
old woman like me live here alone? An old 
woman who lived on the east street alone like 
me was strangled to death by burglars. No one 
knows if they were petty thieves, or people 
from the Ava group, or army, or navy. There 
isn’t a huge distance between the east street 
and the west street, is there? Anything can 
happen to me at any time.”
“Why don’t you go stay with some relatives 
for some time, ammā?”
“Where can I go? Your appā had made 
enemies of everyone before he departed this 
world. But it must be said that he never started 
a fight himself. But even if I went to live with 
some relatives, do you think they would take 
good care of me? They would be out to fleece 
money from me, son! This is not the Sri Lanka 
you left. Everyone is focused on money from 
abroad.”
“It is difficult to come here now ammā. 
They have tightened the rules. You have also 
become old.”
“That is no problem. Just last month, 
Sellaiyā’s wife was taken to Canada by her 
children. She is two years older than me. She 
moved around in a wheelchair. I still have 
strength in both my legs. I draw water from 
the well all by myself. I collect coconuts 
from the yard. When rainwater floods into the 
house, I am the one who empties the water by 
myself using a coconut shell. I catch a bus to 
travel to the General Hospital ten miles away. 
But how much longer can I live alone, son? I 
have fifteen grandchildren. My corpse would 
not even burn if I die without touching the 
face of even one of them. Will you come to 
light my pyre?
My sisters were unanimous in siding with 
ammā.
“Brother! Until now ammā had never asked 
us for even a single Euro. She did not 
extravagantly spend the money that we did 
send but saved it by living frugally. If we 
cannot fulfill her wish at the evening of her 
life, we don’t deserve to be her children. 
Brother… if you are short of money, we will 
give you money. Don’t worry that you will 
be burdened with taking care of her once 
she arrives here. We are her four daughters. 
We will not let her daughter-in-law bear the 
burden of taking care of her.”
I was angered even more listening to my 
sisters talk as if I was the one placing 
roadblocks on ammā’s way to France. 
Incensed, I started looking for an agent that 
very day. Kailāsanāthan, who works in the 
same natural food market as me, came forward</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

to help. He introduced me by phone to a friend 
of his in Colombo who works as an agent for 
migrants. Even though the agent demanded a 
large fee, I agreed to it. It was to be a trip by 
air. I was required to pay half the fee up front 
and the remaining half once ammā landed in 
France. I did not want to borrow even a cent 
from my sisters. I emptied my bank account 
to pay the deposit. For the rest, we would use 
Sevvanthi’s jewelry. 
Within a week of receiving the money, the 
agent took ammā to Delhi. He prepared an 
Indian passport she could travel to France on. 
He craftily inserted her into a group of elderly 
Indians going on a tour of France.  But the 
airport authorities in Delhi thwarted this trick 
with an old simple counter trick. They had 
asked ammā to count from one to ten with 
her fingers. She had done so by folding finger 
after finger. Apparently, when Indians count, 
they open finger after finger, instead of folding 
them like us. Therefore, the authorities easily 
concluded that ammā was not Indian.
When the agent reluctantly revealed to me 
over the phone that ammā had been sent to 
the immigration prison in Delhi, I cursed him 
out with the choicest obscenities. Just think! 
An eighty-year-old lady being imprisoned in a 
country where she did not even speak the local 
language. Are you not more infuriated than I 
am! I did not let my sisters know that ammā 
was in prison. They would not be able to bear 
this news. All their sorrow will turn into anger 
at me for making a careless mistake with her 
travel arrangements.
The full force of my anger turned to 
Kailāsanāthan who had introduced the idiot 
agent to me. Having volunteered to help me, 
he was forced into a situation of having had 
to listen to a mouthful of abuse from me. But 
that kindhearted man understood my worry 
and anger and started harrying the idiot agent. 
Within five days, ammā was released from 
prison. When she called me on the phone, 
I could not help weeping. The idiot agent 
suggested that he could try once again via 
Mumbai airport. “Forget it! Take ammā safely 
back to the village,” I said. In that case, he 
said he could not return the 50% advance 
he had received. I responded, “That is fine, 
I don’t want that money back! It is enough 
for me if you take ammā safely back to Sri 
Lanka.”
The following week, ammā called me on the 
phone from Sri Lanka.
“Son! It looks like it is difficult to travel via 
India. Now they are showing on TV that 
people travel to France via Ukraine…”
“Ammā! There is a war raging in Ukraine,” I 
said.
“That is ok, son. I have seen enough war in my 
life! Don’t fret for nothing. They would not do 
anything to an old woman who could die any 
day now,” said ammā. 
She called me every day on WhatsApp to 
talk. She repeated many times that she could 
not stay on in Sri Lanka for even a minute 
more. “What is the point of having money? 
Groceries are hard to find! People here are 
going to die of starvation. We are forced to eat 
the spinach that grows on garbage piles, and 
the rice paste that the Chinese are donating,” 
she wailed. How could we children have the 
heart to eat even a mouthful after listening to a 
lament like this?
I could not focus properly on my work at my 
natural food market. I kept thinking about 
ammā. Would she die of her unfulfilled desire 
to move to France? My head was in turmoil. 
My Jewish boss noticed my disquiet. He called 
me over to tell me that there was an order from</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
86
the old lady Olymp and asked me to collect 
all the items on her grocery list and deliver 
them. Usually, I would be excited at making 
a delivery to Olymp. Although I did not have 
the same excitement this time, the prospect of 
visiting Olymp did bring some peace of mind.
When I joined this Jewish natural food 
market two years ago, my first job was to 
take groceries in a cart to Olymp’s house for 
delivery. Her house was not far away. The old 
house was on a small plot of land just opposite 
the tram stop where I usually get off on my 
way to work.
Olymp was born to French-Corsican parents. 
She was about the same age as my ammā. 
Like ammā, she, too, lived alone. Although 
she was of average height, her back was bent, 
which made her look rather short. She had a 
dusting of facial hair, and a small bald patch 
on the top of her head. Old lady Olymp rarely 
ventured outside her house. She had a degree 
in psychology. Her house was full of thick 
hardcover books with black covers.
On the very first day I went to her house, the 
lady looked at me with her gray eyes shining 
and invited me to come inside her house and 
sit down.
“Handsome young man! Are you Sri Lankan?”
“Yes… madame,” I said.
Thereafter, every time I went to her house to 
make a delivery, the old lady told me this story 
little by little:
“Yes son! It was only a few years after the 
second world war. France was starting to 
flourish again after being liberated from the 
Nazis. Our family lived in this house even 
then. My father had died in the war. My 
mother had befriended a rough Greek fellow. I 
was thirteen years old.
A Sri Lankan family came from somewhere 
to settle down in this village. I don’t know if 
it was a Sinhala family or a Tamil family or 
a mixed one. There was a young boy in that 
family, close to my age. He joined our school. 
At the beginning, he didn’t know a word of 
French, but could speak a bit of Portuguese, 
which I could understand somewhat. His name 
was Thomas.
Very quickly I fell in love with that shy, 
young, brown man. Then this was a tiny 
village. The woods were full of flowers. 
Unlike now, there was a lot of water in the 
river. Horses would graze quietly in the 
meadows. Thomas and I would play in the 
woods and on the river. Shall I tell you 
something interesting? Thomas didn’t even 
know how to kiss. I taught him that.
When my mother found out about our 
relationship, she scolded me strongly. Her 
Greek lover beat me brutally. But I did not 
stop seeing Thomas. But one day, the entire 
Sri Lankan family disappeared from this 
village. I could never forget that relationship 
which lasted barely two months. I harbored 
the idiotic notion that one day I would travel 
to Sri Lanka. This old woman does not need to 
hide that from you, son!”
There were many books, pictures, statues, 
masks, and maps about Sri Lanka in her 
house. She had read a lot about Sri Lanka 
from books. She told me that it made her very 
happy to talk to me. But it did not make my 
boss very happy that I spent time in Olymp’s 
house without promptly returning back to the 
shop after making the delivery.
One day, I invited Olymp to my house and 
served her a variety of Sri Lankan dishes. 
Even though the spiciness made her eyes</p>

water, she enjoyed the food and finished it 
without leaving anything behind on her plate. 
It was a French habit.
“Madame… I will take you to Sri Lanka one 
day,” I told her frequently. She would smile 
like a child. Olymp did not know that I myself 
did not have the ability to visit Sri Lanka.
The first question Olymp asked me when 
I entered her house with my pushcart was, 
“Is your mother in Sri Lanka well? I read in 
the newspaper that people had occupied the 
presidential palace in Colombo, and there 
were protests and scuffles all over the country. 
Is there any problem in your village?”
I will tell you the truth! The moment Olymp 
said ‘problem,’ an idea suddenly lit up brightly 
in my mind. While there was a fierce battle 
in my mind as to whether I should tell Olymp 
about this idea, my pitiful tongue spoke up:
“Madame, would you be able to do me a</p>
<p><img alt="p087_i1.jpg" src="assets/images/017_special_article/p087_i1.jpg" /></p>

favor?”
“Tell me son! I will definitely help!”
“The situation in Sri Lanka is not very good 
now. Famine is spreading. There is a shortage 
of medicines, too. I would like to bring my 
sick mother over to France so that she could 
live with me for a while, Madame…”
“Yes, you should certainly do it, son. How can 
I help you?”
“If you can give my mother a sponsor letter, I 
think they would issue her a visa…”
“Is that all! Just assume that your mother is 
already here! Tell her to get ready for the trip. 
I will go to the town council office right this 
minute to start the paperwork and get all the 
documentation needed for the sponsorship. 
Come to see me in the evening after work.”
I was speechless with gratitude. When she 
saw my eyes moisten, she came over with a 
childlike smile to hug me.
While I was at work at the market, Olymp 
called me on the phone from the town council 
office. She asked me details like ammā’s 
name, address, and date of birth. 
I went to her house that evening with a 
thousand questions racing in my mind. She sat 
me down at her reading desk and gave me five 
neatly folded documents.
“Listen son! The first document is the approval 
from the town council for me to invite your 
mother here on a three-month tourist visa. The 
second has details of my bank account. The 
third is a copy of my French national identity 
card. The fourth is the letter from me to your 
mother inviting her here as my guest. The 
fifth is unnecessary… but they told me at the 
town council that it is the most important one. 
It is my consent to let the Interior Ministry 
begin legal proceedings against me if my 
guest didn’t leave France within three months. 
If your mother takes these documents to the 
French embassy in Colombo and submits a 
visa application, they would definitely grant 
her a visa. I am very eager to meet your 
mother. I will come to see her myself!”
Each of the five documents had a scribbled 
signature by Olymp’s shaky hand.
Even a scribbled French signature carries 
weight, does it not! Within ten days of 
applying for a visa at the French embassy 
in Colombo, she was granted a three-month 
visitor visa. When my sisters heard the news, 
they were exhilarated, and could not stop 
kissing me over the phone. Thereafter, they 
started a fierce competition among themselves 
to decide in whose house ammā was going to 
live. As usual, my third sister Malar, who is 
stubborn and never yields an inch, won.
While they were rejoicing, my heart was in 
turmoil. My ammā would definitely have to 
leave France after three months. She would 
need to leave her five children and fifteen 
grandchildren to return alone to Sri Lanka. 
But I did not have the courage to tell her 
this. It would certainly spoil her joy at the 
prospect of finally being able to come to 
France. I thought I could gently tell her once 
she arrives in France and convince her to 
return within three months. There was another 
possibility. The impending harsh winter, the 
cooped-up apartment-living here, and the habit 
of keeping cooked food in the fridge for a 
week to eat reheated food every day could all 
make ammā weary enough to want to return 
to Sri Lanka. Having lived here for twenty 
years, even my own heart yearns to return 
to Sri Lanka. If ammā, too, develops such a 
yearning and chooses to return to Sri Lanka,</p>

then the problem would be solved amicably. 
Perhaps she could pass on in peace, and her 
body would turn to dust in our own village 
cemetery with the satisfaction of having seen 
her grandchildren.
The third day after ammā’s arrival in France, 
I took Olymp to Malar akkā’s house. Olymp, 
who came with a bouquet of mimosa flowers, 
held ammā’s hand all the time until she 
left. All four of my sisters were there. Even 
though they all welcomed Olymp cheerfully, 
they exchanged glances among them as if to 
indicate that she was an unwanted guest.
One day, ammā told me:
“Son! There is no one back home to look after 
our house and land. Before some neighbor 
tries to take them over with fake deeds, we 
should sell the house. It won’t fetch much. 
In that largely abandoned village, a third of a 
hectare of land would barely fetch one lakh 
rupees. A missionary group has been asking to 
buy the house and land. We should sort out the 
paperwork to sell them soon.”</p>

“Ammā… that was the house we all grew up 
in. That is the only identity we have left in Sri 
Lanka. Let us leave it be….”<br />
“So, what! None of us are returning to Sri 
Lanka. Did your appā gain all that wealth for 
thieves to enjoy? Get on with selling it, son.”
I did not imagine that ammā would come to 
like France so much. She enjoyed the snow 
and cold like a little child. Once when I visited 
Malar akkā, she was sitting on the carpet 
learning French from her granddaughter.
“Ammā! Don’t sit on the floor… you would be 
cold,” I said.
“Chī chī.. I think this cold is just the right 
medicine for my maladies. Since I came here, 
I have not caught a cold or had a fever… one 
should learn the language of the land one 
plans to live in, son. That is why I have started 
to learn French. Your appā was able to go all 
the way to Colombo to succeed in business 
because he knew Sinhala,” she said.
Two-and-a-half months had passed since 
ammā came to France. Even though she was 
based in Malar akkā’s house, she did the 
rounds among the homes of the other children, 
spending a couple of days in each. In between, 
my eldest sister and her family took ammā to 
Lourdes. Ammā toured Paris and its suburbs 
visiting all the Hindu temples. After going to 
the riverbank to play with the grandchildren, 
she marveled, “Chchā, what a wonderful 
country! Is there even a single bug, or creepy 
crawly or snake?” From time to time, she 
reminded me that we ought to sell the house 
and land in the village.
When barely two weeks were left before 
ammā’s visa was to expire, I called my eldest 
sister on the phone and said:
“Periyakkā… you are the one to gently tell 
ammā that she needs to return to Sri Lanka on 
the thirtieth.”
“Thambi.. What crazy talk is this? After all 
the trouble we went through to bring her here, 
should we send her back? What would this 
woman do in Sri Lanka? She will only be alive 
for another year or two. Let her live here. You 
don’t have to struggle anymore. I will take 
care of everything that needs to be done. The 
day after the visa expires, I will take her to the 
Police to register her as a refugee.”
“Akkā, did I not tell you already? We cannot 
do that. If she does not return, Olymp, who 
sponsored her, will be in legal jeopardy.”
“Olymp and Polymp! If that old woman wants 
money, we can give her some. But we cannot 
send ammā back to Sri Lanka.”
“Look here Periyakkā… Olymp did not do it 
for money. She did it out of love and the trust 
she had in us. She is older than ammā. How 
can we put her in a situation where she had 
to go to the courts? She might even be sent to 
prison..”
“Don’t be crazy, thambi. How many people 
come here as sponsored visitors but remain 
behind seeking asylum. Has there ever been a 
problem? Nothing you fear will come to pass.”
“No Periyakkā… I cannot breach the 
confidence Olymp placed in me. Ammā must 
return back.”
I called my third sister Malar on the phone. 
Before that my eldest sister had called Malar 
and apprised her of the situation. True to her 
nature, Malar barked at me as soon as I called:
“Is that so! Is that how it is! Let’s see how you</p>

are going to send my ammā back. I would take 
her passport right away and burn it,” she said 
haughtily.
“You cannot, Malar akkā… ammā’s passport 
is with me.”
“You have shown your true militant group 
brain, thambi. This old white woman has 
become more important to you than our own 
ammā! Please don’t tell ammā that she has to 
go back home. She will die of anguish right 
this minute. Don’t bear that burden!
But in the end, I had to bear a burden. For 
a week, there was no grocery order from 
Olymp. I did not have the courage to go over 
to her house to see if everything was all right. 
Ammā’s visa problem took a heavy toll on me. 
One day, when I was returning home, I noticed 
that Olymp’s front door was padlocked from 
the outside. Flyers that had been stuck into 
the gaps between the door frame and the 
door were hanging clumsily. How did I miss 
noticing this when I saw her house every 
day from this tram stop? I realized that some 
sort of guilty conscience had unconsciously 
entered me; dirty saliva of guilt pooled within 
my mouth. I spat it out, crossed the street 
and rang Olymp’s neighbor’s doorbell. I was 
somewhat familiar with her Italian neighbor. I 
delivered his groceries, too.
The Italian neighbor said that Olymb had had 
breathing difficulties and was admitted to the 
Central Hospital. I went back to the tram stop 
and started waiting for my tram back home. 
A thousand thoughts materialized within my 
brain like black ants and started busily running 
around.
On the way home, when the tram stopped 
at the Central Hospital station, my legs 
involuntarily got off the tram. I walked as if 
I had consumed a kilo of narcotics. When I 
stood listlessly in front of the reception, the 
receptionist may have mistaken me for a 
patient. I asked her for Olymp’s room number 
and walked up the stairs to Olymp’s, without 
even taking the elevator. The truth was that I 
was trying to postpone as much as possible the 
moment I would have to confront Olymp.
Olymp was lying on the hospital bed with 
her eyes closed. There was an oxygen mask 
covering her face. She looked like a still doll 
in her knee-length blue hospital gown. When I 
asked the head nurse about Olymp’s situation, 
she said mechanically, “This lady’s health has 
been deteriorating steadily… We cannot say 
anything with certainty about her health.” I 
sensed that my soul that had been restless until 
that point, was gradually calming down. Once 
again, guilty saliva secreted copiously within 
my mouth. Until I reached home, I resisted the 
temptation to spit it out
Before I could step into the house, my 
youngest sister Vēṇi called. I spoke with my 
mouth full of saliva.
She asked, “What is this thambi.. Are you 
really going to send ammā back home?” 
I am not sure if she understood what I meant 
when I responded, “We cannot say anything 
with certainty.“
For the next four days, I went to the hospital 
every day without fail to visit Olymp. She lay 
still like a log, with her eyes closed. Because 
I went there every day at the same time, the 
nurse became acquainted with me. When 
she said no one else came to visit Olymp, I 
thought of my ammā.
My ammā never returned to Sri Lanka.</p>
