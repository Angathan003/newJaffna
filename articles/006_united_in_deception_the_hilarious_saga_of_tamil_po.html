ome political parties and civil society organizations are

their real master plan isn't about the presidential election. They

The Hilarious Saga of

can't make a dent in the presidential election 
any more than a mouse can shake an elephant. 
Instead, it's a crafty scheme designed to 
deceitfully capture votes for the subsequent 
parliamentary elections. It's like an elaborate 
magic trick where the real illusion is revealed 
in the second act!
With the pomp and circumstance of an 
international treaty, a memorandum of 
understanding was recently signed by the 
Tamil National Assembly to field a 'Common 
Tamil Candidate' for the presidential election. 
This grandiose agreement involves five parties 
from the Democratic Tamil National Alliance: 
the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil 
Eelam (PLOTE), the Tamil Eelam Liberation 
Organization (TELO), the Eelam People's 
Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), the 
Tamil National Party, and the Democratic 
Fighters Party. Adding to the spectacle, 
it includes the ever-troublesome "Tamil's 
sorrow," C.V. Wigneswaran's Tamil People's 
Alliance, P. Ainkaranesan's Tamil National 
Green Movement, and the Tamil People's 
General Assembly, representing a smorgasbord 
of Tamil civil organizations.
This coalition of Tamil parties and civil society 
organizations, now known as the 'Tamil 
National Assembly,' is a veritable circus of 
opportunistic individuals and organizations. 
While they rally behind the notion of a 
common Tamil candidate, it's hard not to 
see the humor in their theatrics. The idea of 
uniting such a diverse and self-serving group 
under one banner seems almost as fantastical 
as the notion of their candidate making a 
significant impact in the presidential election.
"Understanding that this coalition of Tamil 
parties and civil society organizations is 
not focused on public welfare is not rocket 
science," a known source said. "Their alliance 
for the presidential election, promising a 
'Common Tamil Candidate,' is more of a 
comedic strategy to capture votes for the 
upcoming parliamentary elections. They know 
they can't make a splash in the presidential 
election—it's like expecting a mouse to move 
a mountain. Instead, their main goal is to 
gain influence in the parliamentary elections 
that follow the presidential one. It's all smoke 
and mirrors, designed to pull the wool over 
everyone's eyes and secure their positions in 
the next act of this political theatre.
The presidential election has been 
scheduled for September 21. President Ranil 
Wickremasinghe has announced his candidacy 
as an independent candidate. Meanwhile, 
Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, 
Sarath Fonseka, and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe 
have also declared their intention to run in the 
election. Notably, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has 
resigned as Minister of Justice to contest the 
election.
In contrast, Tamil political parties and civil 
society organizations are still embroiled in 
deliberations over who to field as the common 
Tamil candidate. This situation borders on 
the farcical. Numerous complications and 
disagreements are inevitable. Will they field 
a candidate from the North or the East? If 
from the North, which specific area – Mannar, 
Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, or Mullaitivu? 
Each region has its own local leaders and 
political dynamics, making consensus difficult.
Furthermore, according to the constitution, 
anyone contesting the presidential election 
must be a former member of parliment. This 
means that the so-called civil society leaders 
cannot contest independently. A civil society 
leader who wants to run for President must do</p>

so under a party's banner. This adds another 
layer of complexity: will they find an MP to 
contest, and if so, who will it be?
The question remains whether they will 
choose a candidate from their ranks or seek 
out a former member of Parliament who 
can represent their interests. Identifying a 
suitable candidate who can command broad 
support across different regions and factions 
is a daunting task. The lack of unity and the 
presence of numerous factions and interests 
within the Tamil political and civil landscape 
make it highly improbable that they will reach 
an agreement.
Considering that the Sri Lankan Tamil 
population constitutes less than 11% of the 
total population, you can't help but wonder: 
what's the point of fielding a common Tamil 
candidate? Even if every Tamil person voted 
for this candidate, what difference would it 
make? Instead of uniting, they're more likely 
to end up misleading both themselves and 
the people, continuing their usual pattern of 
political theatrics. It's like watching a comedy 
show where the performers think they're 
starring in a serious drama, but the audience 
knows it's all just a farce.
Moreover, Tamil MPs who support a common 
Tamil candidate, such as Dharmalingam 
Sithadthan and Selvam Adaikalanathan, have 
received substantial special development 
funds from the President. Consequently, they 
cannot openly act against him. These MPs 
must either support Ranil in the presidential 
election or remain silent. In their close circles, 
they have admitted that the concept of a 
common Tamil candidate is a mere facade. 
Numerous witnesses have confirmed that they 
have pledged their support to Ranil in private 
meetings. They have assured Ranil that they 
will secretly work for him while pretending to 
support the common Tamil candidate.
In reality, the parties supporting the common 
Tamil candidate, including the Tamil Eelam 
Liberation Organization (TELO) and the 
Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front 
(EPRLF), faced significant humiliation in 
elections when they contested independently 
before the formation of the Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA) by LTTE supremo 
Prabhakaran. Today, their leaders are seated 
in Parliament only because they contested as 
part of the TNA. In 2022, when the Illankai 
Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), the chief party 
in the TNA, announced it would contest 
independently, their future became uncertain. 
Consequently, they formed another alliance 
to capture votes, leading to this farce of a 
common Tamil candidate.
The irony is that Prabhakaran had killed the 
previous leaders of the parties now part of the 
Tamil National Alliance (TNA). The current 
leaders, without shame or honor, pretended 
their predecessors met their end due to 
something as absurd as snake bites or insect 
stings. They conveniently ignored the brutal 
reality of their predecessors' deaths and instead 
accepted Prabhakaran's orders to form the 
alliance.
These leaders, who owe their current positions 
to the very individual who eliminated their 
former leaders, are now forming yet another 
alliance. By pretending to unite under the 
guise of a common cause, they hope to 
manipulate the electorate once more.
No one has any shame!</p>
