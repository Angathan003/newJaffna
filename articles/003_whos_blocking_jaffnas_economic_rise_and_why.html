Who’s Blocking Jaffna’s 
Economic Rise-and Why?
A
rguably, apart from tourists, the Sri Lankan Tamil 
diaspora constitutes the largest cohort of frequent 
visitors to Sri Lanka, with the majority tracing their 
ancestral lineage to Jaffna. Despite their profound 
historical, cultural, and emotional ties to the North-and the 
existence of an 'international' airport in Palaly-they remain 
deprived of the fundamental convenience of direct air 
connectivity to their homeland.
Established during World War II by the British Royal Air 
Force, Palaly Airport was initially a formidable military 
airfield before evolving into a vital civilian aviation hub 
post-war, ultimately attaining the status of Sri Lanka’s 
second international airport. In 2019, bolstered by India’s 
goodwill, the airport underwent a transformative upgrade 
and was rechristened Jaffna International Airport—
envisioned as a pivotal gateway connecting the northern 
peninsula to the world.
Yet, India’s commitment went beyond mere infrastructure 
enhancement. In a remarkable display of economic 
stewardship, India took an unprecedented step by 
offsetting the initial financial losses incurred by Indian 
Airlines on the Palaly-Chennai route. This strategic 
intervention was more than just a routine economic 
measure—it was a significant diplomatic gesture, 
underscoring the enduring solidarity that Sri Lankan 
Tamils should deeply recognize.
Despite this pivotal development, Palaly Airport remains 
limited to a single route-Chennai-while proposed 
expansions to Tiruchirappalli and Bengaluru remain in 
the pipeline. At present, its runway capacity restricts 
operations to small propeller-driven aircraft with a 
modest seating capacity of 75–80 passengers. This

technical constraint makes it logistically 
and economically unviable for airlines to 
extend operations beyond South India, as 
low passenger capacity inevitably leads to 
financial losses. And, of course, arbitrarily 
increasing ticket prices is not a feasible 
solution to offset these challenges.
While the addition of new destinations signals 
incremental progress, it falls woefully short 
of elevating the airport to its envisioned 
international stature. As a result, the 
"international" designation of Palaly Airport 
remains more of a rhetorical flourish than a 
tangible reality.
Even with its limited connectivity, the 
airport has already demonstrated significant 
economic value, attracting a substantial 
influx of Indian Tamil tourists. The historical 
temples of Sri Lanka’s North and East, 
deeply intertwined with South Indian culture, 
continue to draw pilgrims from Tamil Nadu 
and beyond. The ancient Thirukoneswaram 
Temple in Trincomalee, for instance, regularly 
receives Telugu-speaking devotees from 
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, as confirmed 
by the temple’s management.
Moreover, for residents of the North, traveling 
to India from Jaffna has become increasingly 
convenient. Whether Hindus or Buddhists, 
many Sri Lankans seek spiritual fulfillment in 
India, home to their most revered pilgrimage 
sites—Kashi (Varanasi) for Hindus and Bodh 
Gaya for Buddhists.
However, in a stark paradox, the very 
demographic that Palaly Airport should 
serve as an economic lodestar—the vast 
Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora—remains 
effectively disenfranchised from its utility. 
The airport’s anemic operational capacity 
renders it incapable of facilitating long-
haul international flights, compelling this 
crucial demographic to endure circuitous 
travel routes. What ought to have been an 
indispensable nexus of connectivity and 
economic revitalization remains a vestigial 
facility, its latent potential eviscerated by 
infrastructural atrophy.
The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, dispersed 
across more than 100 nations, boasts 
formidable concentrations in Canada, the 
UK, Australia, and Europe. In fact, empirical 
data suggests that the Tamil populace in 
Canada—particularly within the Greater 
Toronto Area—may eclipse Jaffna’s current 
demography. Yet, despite their indelible ties to 
the North, these expatriates remain estranged 
from direct access to their homeland.
The crux of the issue is clear: Jaffna 
International Airport remains hamstrung 
by its inability to accommodate wide-
body aircraft. Successive Sri Lankan 
administrations have displayed chronic short-
sightedness regarding this infrastructural 
deficiency, repeatedly failing to implement 
the necessary expansions. As a result, 
what was once envisioned as a strategic 
international gateway has instead descended 
into irrelevance—an unrealized ambition, 
perpetually stalled by bureaucratic inertia.
A Frustrating Ordeal for the Diaspora
For thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils in the 
diaspora, returning home is not merely a 
trip—it is an emotional pilgrimage. They 
return to reconnect with aging parents, uplift 
extended families, invest in businesses, and 
contribute to charitable endeavors.
Yet, instead of a seamless homecoming, 
they are forced to land at Bandaranaike 
International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake—
nearly 400 km away from Jaffna. After 
enduring long-haul flights exceeding 10</p>

hours, their real ordeal begins on Sri Lankan 
soil. The journey from Colombo to Jaffna-
another grueling 8 to 10 hours by road-is an 
exercise in patience and endurance. Many 
have lamented:
"It’s not the long-haul flight from London 
or Toronto that drains us; it’s the frustrating, 
energy-sapping, and poorly planned road 
journey from Colombo to Jaffna that truly 
exhausts us."
This unnecessary drain on time, money, and 
energy has led some diaspora members to 
avoid Jaffna altogether, opting instead to stay 
in Colombo and nearby cities. The prospect 
of subjecting their children to an exhausting 
road journey often discourages them from 
entirely visiting their ancestral homeland.
A Deliberate Act of Economic Sabotage?
Successive Srilankan governments have 
long engaged in sugar-coated rhetoric about 
reconciliation and development for Northern 
Tamils, yet their actions have consistently 
contradicted their words. While paying lip 
service to economic progress, they have 
systematically ensured that the North never 
reaches its full economic potential.
Every viable investment opportunity has 
been systematically obstructed—whether 
through bureaucratic inertia, policy 
impediments, or sheer neglect. Palaly 
Airport, which had the potential to evolve 
into a thriving international hub, remains 
paralyzed by inadequate infrastructure, while 
Kankesanthurai (KKS) Harbor exists in name 
alone, devoid of any substantial functional 
development.
Look at Colombo and the Western Province. 
Every government has aggressively 
expanded Bandaranaike International Airport, 
transformed the Port of Colombo into a global 
transshipment hub, and invested billions into 
expressways leading to the South. What did 
Jaffna receive? A half-baked airport and an 
abandoned natural harbor.
A marine engineer friend once shared an 
eye-opening reality with me—one that, 
in many ways, explains why Sri Lanka 
has struggled economically. KKS Port—a 
large, strategically located harbor just 30 
km from Indian ports like Rameswaram 
and Nagapattinam—remains grossly 
underutilized. Instead of facilitating direct 
trade, goods from India must first be shipped 
to Colombo—nearly 400 km away—only 
to be transported back to Jaffna by road, 
incurring unnecessary costs and logistical 
delays.
The Sri Lankan government must prioritize a 
phased expansion of Palaly Airport, starting 
with runway extension to accommodate mid-
range international flights. Given Sri Lanka’s 
economic constraints, a Public-Private 
Partnership (PPP) model could be the most 
viable approach, allowing private investors-
including diaspora business leaders-to 
contribute capital in exchange for long-term 
operational stakes.
Moreover, India has consistently expressed 
willingness to fund infrastructure 
development in the North—Sri Lanka must 
leverage this commitment through transparent 
agreements ensuring mutual benefit. 
Additionally, the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, 
with its financial strength, should be given 
structured opportunities to invest in aviation 
and trade infrastructure through diaspora 
bonds or targeted investment schemes.

hubs through strategic investment and public-
private partnerships (PPP). A prime example 
is Tiruchirappalli International Airport 
(Trichy), once a modest regional facility 
that now operates as a key gateway for 
South Indian travelers with direct flights to 
Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
The Indian government’s UDAN (Ude 
Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) initiative, aimed 
at enhancing regional connectivity, has 
revitalized dozens of smaller airports by 
expanding runways, incentivizing airlines, 
and securing private investment. Today, 
even cities with smaller populations, like 
Coimbatore and Madurai, boast international 
flight networks—a model that could be 
replicated in Jaffna with the right policy 
interventions.
A Turning Point: NPP Must Break This Cycle
The cycle of political betrayal must be 
dismantled, and the National People’s 
Power (NPP) government now stands at a 
defining crossroads. It must prove itself as 
a true departure from the status quo. Unlike 
previous regimes that alienated the North and 
East, the people of these regions-including 
Jaffna-have placed historic trust in the 
NPP, electing three out of six MPs from the 
district. For decades, successive governments 
dismissed their obligations with the unspoken 
justification: “They didn’t vote for us.” That 
feeble excuse has now been unequivocally 
invalidated.
Jaffna-once the epicenter of separatist 
tensions in Sri Lanka’s political discourse-
has turned a new page. By voting for the 
NPP, the people have embraced a vision of 
a unified Sri Lanka, a conscious departure 
from past divisions. Now, the onus lies on the 
NPP government to honor this trust through 
tangible economic revitalization, not mere 
rhetoric.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a leader widely 
revered among Tamils as one of their own, 
shoulders an unequivocal duty to ensure 
the advancement of Tamil-majority regions. 
Can an economy flourish when its primary 
gateway to the world remains a skeletal 
airport, incapable of handling even mid-range 
international flights? Can a region unlock its 
commercial potential when its harbor remains 
a dilapidated relic of neglect?
If the NPP fails to develop Jaffna Airport and 
KKS Harbor, it will shatter the credibility of 
its own revolutionary promise, proving itself 
no different from its predecessors—another 
administration complicit in the same systemic 
marginalization that has throttled Jaffna’s 
progress for generations. The people have 
moved forward, rejecting stagnation and 
cynicism. Now, the government must rise to 
the occasion—or expose itself as yet another 
steward of hollow pledges and deferred 
aspirations.
Jaffna’s immense potential is undeniable, yet 
the real test lies ahead-will the government 
seize this historic moment or doom yet 
another generation to the crushing weight of 
state-engineered neglect? The path forward is 
crystal clear-bold action or outright betrayal. 
Will they finally deliver on their promises, 
or will they stab in the back the very people 
who, for the first time in history, placed their 
trust in them?
