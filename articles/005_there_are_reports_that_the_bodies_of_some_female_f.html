same high ideals.
How many female fighters from the 
Eastern unit were casualties in the 
Verugal massacre?
As I was unconscious, I do not have the exact 
details. However, I was later informed that 
scores of innocent fighters were killed.
Don't you feel any anger towards the 
person who shot you in the thigh?
No, I do not.
Have you identified the person who 
shot you?
Yes, I have identified him, but I prefer not to 
disclose his name. He is no longer alive.
Who saved you?
I was saved by the girls who were with me and 
Jayam Anna.
There are reports that the bodies 
of some female fighters from 
the Eastern forces were left in a 
dishevelled state with torn clothes, 
insulted in unimaginable ways by 
the Vanni Tigers. Can you confirm if 
this is true?
I do not have direct knowledge of these incidents 
as I was hospitalized at the time. The local 
people of Kathiraveli, who buried the bodies of 
our fighters, have made these claims. Visitors 
who came to see me in the hospital shared these 
details in distressing conversations. However, I 
cannot confirm their accuracy since I did not 
witness the events.
How many months were you in the 
hospital?
I was in the Batticaloa hospital for eight months.
Did Pottu Amman's death squad 
came looking for you?
Due to heavy police security, they were unable 
to visit me in the hospital. However, they came 
to my home and urged my family to relay a 
message that I should meet them as soon as 
possible. I informed them that I was unable to 
come. After being discharged from the hospital, 
I chose not to visit anyone and stayed at home, 
remaining neutral and not taking any sides.
Were you aware of the potential 
conflict with the Vanni Tigers arising 
from Karuna Amman's disagreement 
with Prabhakaran?
No, we were not aware. Karuna Amman spoke 
Lt. Col. Mathana (Nagenthirama Karunathevi), a key commander in 
the Anparasi Regiment, was killed in action in 1997. The Mathana 
Brigade was named in her honor.</p>

to me just a few days ago, and even then, he 
did not mention anything about an imminent 
attack from the Vanni Tigers.
Did you attend the meeting called 
by Karuna Amman to discuss 
the rights and representation of 
eastern fighters with the eastern 
commanders?
Yes, I attended that meeting. During the 
discussion, Karuna Amman highlighted the 
denial of our rights and representation by the 
LTTE leadership. However, he did not mention 
any plans to engage in combat with the Vanni 
Tigers. Additionally, there was no suggestion 
of an imminent attack by the Vanni Tigers, 
nor did he outline any strategies for defence or 
offence in the event of such an attack.
It is reported that Karuna Amman 
deliberately positioned eastern 
regiments along the banks of the 
Verugal River in preparation for 
combat with Vanni Tigers. Is this 
true?
No, Karuna Amman did not instruct 
commanders, including myself, to prepare for 
combat. Furthermore, none of the ordinary 
fighters from our side were aware of such 
preparations, and almost all of them did not 
even know there was a minor problem between 
Karuna Amman and the LTTE leadership. 
Therefore, it is inaccurate to suggest that he was 
preparing for combat. It's utter nonsense.
When the war ended in 2009 and 
ultimately led to the killing of 
Prabhakaran, what was your state of 
mind?
I was filled with sadness and devastation.
