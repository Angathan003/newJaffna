F
isheries Minister Douglas Devananda, 
founder and secretary of the Eelam People's 
Democratic Party (EPDP), has achieved a 
remarkable feat unmatched by any Tamil 
politician in Sri Lanka's history—completing 
30 uninterrupted years in Parliament. On 
August 16th, he celebrated this milestone, 
underscoring his enduring influence in 
the Tamil political landscape. Now, with 
his party firmly backing President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe's candidacy, we sat down 
with Minister Devananda to gain his insights 
into this pivotal moment and the evolving 
political landscape.
You were among the earliest 
to endorse President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe for the upcoming 
election, even before other political 
players made their move. What 
makes you confident that the Tamil 
community should rally behind him, 
and how do you plan to inspire their 
support at the polls?
My relationship with Ranil Wickremesinghe 
spans decades, dating back to 1990 when I 
returned to Colombo from India to participate 
in the National Political Stream. Even in 
his speeches, he humorously claims that he 
'trained' me. While some might mistake this 
for military training, it was purely political. 
Over the years, I have met with him numerous 
times to address the pressing concerns of our 
people, which has led to a long-standing, trust-
based political relationship.
There were, of course, interruptions in our 
association due to changes in government. 
However, three years ago, when the country 
was on the brink of economic collapse, 
then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa called 
upon many prominent leaders to form the 
government. Among those invited were leaders 
who are now contesting the presidential 
election, yet none were willing to take on the 
responsibility, fearing political consequences.
They were afraid that if they took on the 
responsibility, they too would fall into the 
political abyss, and their political careers 
would be ruined. But President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, with courage and a sense 
of duty towards the nation and its people, 
stepped forward and has since led the country 
from darkness towards light. I believe that the 
majority of the people in this country have 
realized this.
Ever since the current President, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, took on the role, I expressed 
my belief that, given the circumstances at the 
time, he was the only one capable of leading 
the country out of the economic collapse and 
towards recovery. I was the first to applaud 
him during the initial cabinet meeting, a 
gesture of my faith in his ability. That faith has 
not been misplaced.
I've had the privilege of walking alongside 
President Wickremesinghe during this 
challenging time, and I firmly believe that, 
under his leadership, the country is headed 
toward a future of progress and prosperity. I 
am confident that ordinary citizens see this 
too—that they've witnessed his courage and 
leadership when it was most needed. And I 
trust that, when it comes time to vote, many 
will remember who stood by them and helped 
turn the tide.

How can you logically conclude 
that Tamils will vote for Ranil 
Wickremesinghe?
Ranil Wickremesinghe has long been a familiar 
and welcoming figure to the Tamil community. 
His history of engaging with Tamil concerns 
has fostered trust over the years. A clear 
example of this connection was during the 
2019 Sri Lankan presidential election. While 
Sajith Premadasa was the UNP's candidate, 
Ranil personally took charge of overseeing 
the campaign in the Northern and Eastern 
provinces, where the majority of Tamils 
reside. This action strongly suggests that Ranil 
understands the concerns of the Tamil people 
and resonates with their aspirations.
During the Kilinochchi election campaign, just 
days before the vote, we organized a political 
rally that drew over 5,000 attendees—an 
unprecedented show of support in the region. 
Such a large turnout in Tamil areas reflects 
the deep rapport Ranil has cultivated with the 
Tamil electorate over the years.
Reports indicate that many 
participants from the Aragalaya 
movement, which protested against 
former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 
are now said to be supporting the 
National People's Power (NPP) and its 
presidential candidate, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake. Some suggest that he is 
gaining momentum, particularly in the 
southern regions of the country. How 
do you perceive this potential shift, 
and what impact could it have?
There's certainly a lot of buzz around this 
shift, but if we look at past election data, the 
NPP has historically secured only a small 
percentage of the vote, around 3-4%. Whether 
this newfound support can translate into 
a majority sufficient to win the presidency 
remains to be seen. It's still unclear if this 
momentum is sustainable.
The Aragalaya protests arose from widespread 
frustration over the lack of essential goods—
food, fuel, medicine—driving people to the 
streets. Today, many of those pressing issues 
have been addressed, and life has largely 
returned to normal. The immediate crisis is 
no longer as acute, and stability is gradually 
returning.
Ranil Wickremesinghe stepped in when the 
country was on the brink of collapse. There 
were shortages of almost everything, with long 
queues for essentials. Under his leadership, 
those shortages have been addressed, and the 
country has regained a level of normalcy.
Additionally, the Peoples' Struggle Alliance, 
formed by Aragalaya activists, has named 
Lawyer Nuwan Bopage as their presidential 
candidate. This shows that not all Aragalaya 
protesters are aligning with the NPP, so the 
assumption that the entire movement is 
supporting Anura Kumara Dissanayake is not 
entirely accurate.
How has your transition from 
involvement in the armed struggle to 
joining the National Political Stream 
shaped your perspective on national 
reconciliation and the leadership 
needed to address the challenges 
faced by the Tamil community?
As for my journey, my involvement in the</p>

armed struggle was not born out of impulsive 
emotion; it stemmed from a long history of 
grievances. However, over time, I realized that 
armed conflict wouldn't bring the Tamil people 
the justice they deserve. This realization led 
me to join the National Political Stream. Our 
guiding principle has always been clear: "We 
will act and enable others to act." This isn't just 
a slogan; it embodies our approach to national 
reconciliation. We tell our people, "Trust us, 
walk with us, and we will lead you forward, 
helping to resolve the issues you face." This is 
not empty talk—it's a philosophy we live by, 
laying the foundation for real, lasting change.
Unlike some other Tamil politicians, I have 
never returned to my community, claiming, 
"The Sinhalese leaders deceived us." I don't 
believe in making excuses or shifting blame.
How do you view the approach of other 
Tamil political parties in addressing 
the community's issues? Do you 
believe they are genuinely working 
towards solutions, or are they keeping 
these problems alive for political gain, 
as seen in past events like the Thimpu 
talks?
Unfortunately, many Tamil political parties 
continue to operate in a way that prioritizes 
their own political gain over genuinely 
addressing the community's challenges. A 
prime example of this can be seen during the 
Thimpu talks. At that time, I was with the 
EPRLF, and we, along with the other armed 
groups, participated in the negotiations 
without fully understanding how the outside 
world or international politics functioned. 
Our goal was to disrupt the process, and we 
put forth demands we knew the Sri Lankan 
government wouldn't accept, aside from 
perhaps one.
However, the troubling reality is that even 
today, Tamil politicians—who now understand 
the dynamics of global politics—still follow 
a similar approach. They keep Tamil issues

unresolved, not out of ignorance, but 
intentionally, to sustain their own political 
relevance.
In 2015, for instance, the Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA) helped bring the Good 
Governance government to power by 
promising a new constitution. When those 
efforts failed, they shifted the narrative, 
claiming betrayal by the Sinhala leaders. They 
knowingly manipulate these situations for their 
benefit, perpetuating the same harmful cycle 
at the expense of real progress for the Tamil 
people.
We must start with what we already have. The 
13th Amendment and the provincial council 
system are embedded in our constitution, 
and it's practical to build on this foundation 
to secure further rights. Ironically, the same 
people who once labelled me a traitor for 
supporting the 13th Amendment now demand 
it themselves, asking, "Will you give us half or 
three-quarters of the rights?"
The truth is that Tamil rights can only be 
secured through national reconciliation. 
Real solutions come from working with both 
the ruling party and the opposition. Yet, 
some Tamil politicians have hidden agendas, 
preferring to perpetuate these issues rather 
than solve them.
Take Sumanthiran, for instance—he claimed 
they'd support anyone who grants federalism, 
but in reality, that's an impossible promise 
in this country. The term "federalism" alone 
terrifies the Sinhala majority. What we need 
are tangible rights, not divisive labels.
We've missed countless opportunities, many 
of them due to failures in Tamil leadership 
itself. These were chances earned through the 
sacrifices of our people, but the leadership 
simply let them slip away. For example, before 
the Indo-Lanka Accord, we used to call it the 
"Sinhala government," but after the Accord 
was signed, the political landscape in the South 
fundamentally shifted. We should have seized 
that moment.
When C.V. Wigneswaran became the 
Northern Province Chief Minister, he was 
given a golden opportunity. Initially, he

refused to take the oath 
before President Mahinda 
Rajapaksa but later did so, 
much to Rajapaksa's delight. 
I witnessed Rajapaksa gifting 
Wigneswaran a picture of 
Lord Ganesha in goodwill. 
Yet, despite this opportunity, 
Wigneswaran returned 
crores of unutilized funds 
meant for the Northern 
Province back to the central 
government—funds that 
could have transformed the 
region.
Many Tamil leaders are often 
driven by external agendas. 
A recent example is Tamil 
Arasu Katchi's endorsement 
of Sajith Premadasa, only 
for its leader, Maavai 
Senathirajah, to publicly 
oppose it, then reverse his 
stance the next day—an 
embarrassing spectacle.
In the end, it's clear that 
many Tamil leaders are 
playing a political game, 
keeping the struggles of the 
people alive for their own 
benefit, rather than genuinely 
working towards meaningful 
solutions.
What is your opinion 
about the common 
Tamil candidate?
It's the same old strategy 
our so-called Tamil leaders 
have been using from the 
beginning—keeping the 
Tamil people's issues unresolved just to capture votes. It's a 
playbook they never seem to put down. Even among those 
advocating for a "common Tamil candidate," there's no unity. 
They're riddled with disagreements and divisions within their 
own ranks.
Can the common Tamil candidate bring about any 
real change?
Absolutely not. If anything, it will just deepen the existing 
gaps. As you pointed out, this election is a three-way race, so 
the reality is we need to engage in discussions with the major 
candidates.
Sinhala candidates aren't going to support anything beyond the 
13th Amendment, and they certainly aren't going to consider 
federalism. These candidates aren't about to risk angering or

alienating southern Sinhala voters. They won't 
start antagonizing the Sinhala masses just 
because some Tamil leaders engage in hollow 
rhetoric—which, honestly, is no better than 
political belching. It's loud, it's empty, and it 
disappears into thin air with no substance.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, however, has clearly 
stated in his manifesto that he intends to fully 
implement the 13th Amendment. He's agreed 
to return the powers that were taken over by 
executive decisions. The first step is simple—
all it needs is a presidential signature. But 
the Tamil parties don't want to acknowledge 
this because once the real issues are resolved, 
they'd lose their favourite tool for political 
manipulation. They thrive on keeping things 
unresolved.
The second step involves securing a simple 
majority in Parliament. For example, if 50 
members are present, only 26 votes are 
needed to pass a motion. The third step is 
securing a two-thirds majority, which is more 
challenging. However, if the first two steps are 
accomplished, the third will follow naturally. 
Yet, Tamil parties are reluctant to agree to any 
of this because it disrupts their game.
Now, let's talk about the Tamil political 
landscape. Each of these parties has its own 
ideology, but the truth is that they were all 
bundled together by Prabhakaran, much like 
a sack full of potatoes, to form the TNA. After 
Prabhakaran's demise, the sack unravelled, and 
the potatoes rolled all over the place. The bag 
that once held them together? It's completely 
disintegrated. And now, these scattered parties 
are running in different directions, with no 
one able to tie them together again. It's almost 
comical.
Tamil Leaders with divisive agendas should 
prove their strength by standing on their own 
two feet and running as independent entities. 
Once they've shown what they can do, they can 
talk about forming alliances. But clearly, that's 
too much for them to handle.
If we can secure 4-5 seats in the upcoming 
parliamentary elections, we will be in a strong 
position to resolve many of our issues. We have 
a solid plan for national reconciliation backed 
by a robust policy framework.
Unlike other parties, we don't just throw

around lofty ideas—we have a comprehensive 
action plan. Other Tamil parties, on the other 
hand, make a lot of noise about federalism, but 
where are their real, actionable plans? What do 
those who oppose a unitary state actually bring 
to the table? I doubt they have much to show. 
we are not just pushing policies; we're offering 
a practical way forward, and that's what sets us 
apart.
You have been a Member of 
Parliament for 30 years, yet your party 
has struggled to win a significant 
number of seats in Parliament. 
Additionally, a Saiva religious preacher 
recently commented that you operate 
more like a militant leader—not in 
terms of violence, but in your style of 
leadership. He also claimed that your 
party lacks future leadership. What is 
your perspective on this?
Leadership, whether in my party or any other, 
cannot be predicted or appointed prematurely. 
It is something that naturally arises when 
the time and circumstances demand it. If 
you look at any political party, not just ours, 
it's impossible to say with certainty who the 
next leader will be. Take the Tamil parties, for 
example—who can definitively point out the 
future leaders of each? Leadership emerges out 
of necessity—when a void presents itself, it will 
be filled, just as it was in my own journey.
As for the preacher's comments, I must 
point out that 90 percent of what he wrote 
in the same article was, in fact, praise for 
me. The remaining part, where he criticizes 
my leadership style, stems from his own 
apprehension. It seems that if he were to praise 
me without reservation, he fears that he might 
be marginalized within his own circles. I see 
no reason to dwell on such remarks. After 
three decades of dedicated public service, 
I believe my actions speak far louder than 
any accusations. In leadership, it's not about 
seeking validation from critics but about 
staying true to one's principles and actions.
Why has your party yet to be able to 
increase its number of parliamentary 
seats?
I accept that our campaign efforts have not 
been as robust as they should be, and that's 
something we need to improve. However, 
there is a deeper issue at play, and that is the 
pervasive false narratives that have been spread 
about us by the Tigers and their proxies. They 
have led a well-coordinated smear campaign 
against us, spreading vile lies and propaganda 
that, unfortunately, many people believed. But 
the truth is far from what was painted about 
us.
For years, I have chosen not to respond to 
these falsehoods because I firmly believe that 
the truth does not need constant defence. I 
know who I am, my party knows me, and most 
importantly, the people who support us know 
the truth. I saw no reason to dignify those 
lies with responses. The accusations made 
against us never held any weight. After the 
2015 elections, during the Maithripala Sirisena 
administration, they made multiple attempts 
to involve me in false cases, yet none of those 
accusations stood. They were all proven to be 
untrue.
We have faced adversity and slander but 
have endured because our integrity remains 
unshaken. There's an old MGR song that 
perfectly encapsulates my approach to these 
challenges: 'Cu; ghu;j;j cz;ikfs; 
cdf;fhf thOk;" The truths witnessed by</p>

the world will live for you." This sentiment resonates deeply 
with me. I have always adhered to the belief that when you 
are grounded in truth, you do not need to shout to be heard.
What is your estimation of the other two 
prominent presidential candidates, Sajith 
Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake?
As for the other two candidates, Sajith Premadasa and 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, I believe there's little need for 
further comment. At this juncture, our nation's priority lies 
in addressing its most urgent challenges, and I trust Ranil to 
be the leader best equipped to meet them head-on.
There seems to be growing speculation about 
who truly controls the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK) today. 
With internal leadership 
struggles and factions 
within the party backing 
different presidential 
candidates, is ITAK losing 
its status as the primary 
party representing the 
Tamil people?
It is indeed true that, in its 
early years, the ITAK played a 
pivotal role in advocating for 
the grievances and aspirations 
of the Tamil people. When we 
were children and teenagers, 
it stood at the forefront of the 
fight for Tamil rights. However, 
over time, Prabhakaran began 
using the party for his own 
purposes, manipulating it like 
a Petromax lamp—adjusting 
its influence, turning it up or 
down as it suited his needs.
I disagree with the notion that 
ITAK remains the primary 
party representing the Tamil 
community today. At one 
point, they were proxies for 
Prabhakaran, and now they 
seem to serve the interests 
of other external forces. The 
internal power struggles and 
lack of unified direction have 
diluted their standing, and 
they no longer hold the same 
significance or authority they 
once did.
