t has been fourteen years since the end of the 
civil war in Sri Lanka, during which the leader 
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and his family, including his wife and children, 
were killed. However, recurring rumors persist that 
Prabhakaran is still alive, reminiscent 
of a lingering drizzle after the rain has 
ceased. Someone spreads such rumors 
every year, claiming to have spoken 
with Prabhakaran. Among those 
who frequently make these claims, 
Nedumaran and Kasi Anandan in Tamil 
Nadu are prominent figures.
As usual, at the beginning of this year, 
they announced to journalists that 
Prabhakaran was alive and claimed he 
would soon make a public appearance, 
stirring interest among Tamil people in 
Tamil Nadu and the diaspora. However, 
everyone has soon forgotten this news in today's fast-
paced world. The Tamils living in Sri Lanka are not 
concerned about these rumors because they know 
the truth, and their current needs and lifestyles have 
moved to a different phase. Moreover, they despise the 
word 'war.'
While everyone had forgotten the announcement of 
Prabhakaran's return, in the lead-up to November, the 
month of 'Maaveerar Naal' approached, Nedumaran 
and Kasi Anandan released a new statement. This 
time, they claimed not Prabhakaran, but his daughter, 
Duvaraga, is alive and will address the people on 
Maaveerar Day.
Let's see what purpose these announcements serve 
and who is behind them.
After the defeat of the LTTE and the demise of their 
key commanders, leader, and his family during the 
final stages of the Eelam War between 2006-2009, 
the organization faced a complex and contentious 
phase. During this critical period, LTTE 
fund collectors had raised millions of 
dollars under the banner of the "Tamil 
Eelam Liberation Fund," contributing 
to the LTTE's substantial financial 
reserves. Over time, the LTTE amassed 
significant wealth, particularly in 
Europe and Canada, investing in various 
enterprises such as petrol stations, 
supermarkets, and even a few temples 
managed through proxies. Following the 
LTTE's collapse, the division of these 
vast assets, held in foreign countries 
under the names of the Tigers and 
their intermediaries, became a source

of conflict. This dispute extended to 
the organization's foreign branches, 
including the International Secretariat, 
the Head Secretariat, and the Tamil 
Rehabilitation Organization, as they 
grappled with allocating and sharing 
funds collected from the people 
during the war's final stages.
The situation escalated when Parithi, 
the French representative of the 
International Secretariat, was killed. 
The need to divide these assets over 
time and the desire to conceal internal 
issues from the public led these 
organizations to be among the first to 
declare that Prabhakaran was still alive 
and would return. This announcement 
was initially a diversion from the 
disputes over asset division.
These conflicts attracted the attention 
of police in various countries, leading 
to the realization that they involved a 
struggle over the LTTE's proxy assets. 
Consequently, some assets were seized 
and nationalized. Realizing the gravity 
of their situation, the higher-ups in the 
organization settled their disputes and 
divided the assets among themselves, 
going their separate ways.
Disappointed by this development, 
some individuals conducted one last 
large-scale fundraising operation 
before withdrawing. This operation 
was led by a coalition including 
Cellaiya Jayabalan, known as Abdullah 
from Switzerland, Kirubakaran from 
France, Sreeskantharaja from England, 
Aruna (who is the elder sister of 
Prabhakaran's wife, Mathivathani, 
from England), Inparasa from Sri 
Lanka, Sivajilingam (a Member 
of Parliament from Sri Lanka), 
and others from Tamil Nadu like 
Nedumaran, Kasi Anandan, and V. 
Gowthaman.
According to sources, Nedumaran 
and Kasi Anandan were designated 
as the authoritative spokespeople 
of a significant coalition. Notably, 
Vaiko and Thirumavalavan, who 
typically participate in such groups, 
abstained this time, possibly due to 
their engagement with the DMK 
alliance in the government. Efforts 
to include Seeman, known for his 
audacious and often unverifiable 
claims like dining on tortoise meat 
with Prabhakaran, were unsuccessful. 
Seeman, who firmly believed 
Prabhakaran was deceased and 
based his political actions on this 
narrative, chose not to join a coalition 
asserting Prabhakaran's survival, as it 
contradicted his stance.
Earlier this year, sources reported that 
Nedumaran and Kasi Anandan, after 
claiming the impending return of 
Prabhakaran, intended to broadcast 
a recorded speech in his voice on 
Maaveerar Day. To accomplish this, 
they sought the assistance of Tamil 
Nadu mimicry artists. However, these 
artists ultimately declined the task due 
to concerns about fear and potential 
legal repercussions.
Ultimately, the 'Great Deception' was a 
worldwide wake-up call for the Tamil 
community. It highlighted the need 
for transparency and accountability 
in their political and fundraising 
activities. The tragic exploitation 
of a community's pain for personal 
gain underscored the importance 
of moving beyond the shadows of 
the past and focusing on building a 
future based on truth, justice, and 
reconciliation.
