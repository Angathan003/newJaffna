D
r. S. Jaishankar, the Indian External 
Affairs Minister, undertook an official 
visit to Sri Lanka on June 20, 2024, marking 
his first bilateral engagement since his 
reappointment. This visit came shortly after 
President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited India 
on June 9-10, during which he attended the 
swearing-in ceremony of the new Indian 
government following the General Elections. 
This trip is Dr. Jaishankar's fifth official visit 
to Sri Lanka, with previous visits recorded in 
January 2021, March 2022, January 2023, and 
October 2023.
During his visit, Dr. Jaishankar engaged with 
a broad spectrum of Sri Lankan leaders, 
including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, 
Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, 
Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, and 
former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The 
Indian External Affairs Minister called on 
President Wickremesinghe at the President's 
House, where they held a one-on-one meeting 
followed by comprehensive delegation-level 
talks.
These discussions saw the involvement of 
several prominent Sri Lankan ministers, 
including Minister of Ports, Shipping, and 
Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva; Minister 
of Agriculture and Plantation Industries 
Mahinda Amaraweera; Minister of Foreign 
Dr. Jaishankar Meets 
Sri Lankan Leaders and 
Witnesses ITAK Internal Dispute

Affairs Ali Sabry; and Minister of Power and 
Energy Kanchana Wijesekera. In a whirlwind 
of diplomatic activity, Dr. Jaishankar met 
even more leaders, accomplishing all these 
engagements in just a single day, proving that 
diplomacy can be a marathon run at the speed 
of a sprint.
President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Dr. 
Jaishankar jointly handed over 48 houses 
under the Model Village Housing Project 
in the Colombo and Trincomalee districts, 
as well as 106 houses under Phase III of the 
Indian Housing Project in the Kandy, Matale, 
and Nuwara Eliya districts. Additionally, 
the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre 
(MRCC), a critical hub for search and rescue 
operations at sea, established with an Indian 
grant of USD 6 million, was commissioned in 
a virtual ceremony.
In a press release, India's Ministry of 
External Affairs stated, "The interaction 
of Dr. Jaishankar with the leadership of 
the Government of Sri Lanka provided 
an opportunity to review and accelerate 
progress in the multifaceted India-Sri Lanka 
partnership. One of the key focus areas 
of discussion was the Vision Document 
adopted by President Wickremesinghe 
and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi 
during the former's visit to India in July 
2023. The discussions added momentum 
to the ongoing projects and initiatives for 
promoting connectivity in all its dimensions, 
particularly in the domains of energy, physical 
infrastructure, and economic and people-to-
people ties".
Dr. S. Jaishankar held separate meetings 
with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, 
the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Sajith 
Premadasa, and leaders of various political 
parties from the North, East, and upcountry 
regions.
The session with our Tamil leaders from the 
North and East turned into quite a spectacle, 
thanks to a lively public disagreement between 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) 's two 
factional leaders, S. Shritharan and M. A. 
Sumanthiran.
Eight Tamil leaders attended the meeting. The 
lineup included Mavai Senathirajah, former 
ITAK leader; M. A. Sumanthiran, ITAK's one 
faction leader; S. Shritharan, another ITAK 
faction leader; Shanakiya Rasamanickam, 
ITAK's Batticaloa district MP; Dharmalingam 
Sithadthan, MP and Leader of the People's 
Tamil MPs who attended the meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar</p>

Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam 
(PLOTE); Selvam Adaikalanathan, Leader 
of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization 
(TELO); C.V. Vigneswaran, Leader of the 
Tamil People's National Alliance (TPNA); 
and Selvarajah Kajendren, general secretary 
of the Tamil National People's Front (TNPF). 
Except for Mavai Senathirajah, the others are 
Members of Parliament.
Ironically, just days before this meeting, 
Kajendren had accused the Indian government 
under Modi of supporting "Buddhization" 
in the North and East and alleged that the 
Modi government acts against the wishes of 
Sri Lankan Tamils. Yet, in a twist of political 
theatre, Kajendren still attended the meeting, 
proving that in politics, sometimes you have to 
crash the party you just complained about.
Credible sources who attended the meeting 
told the Jaffna Monitor that it felt more like a 
casual courtesy call than a serious discussion 
of issues. They mentioned that the allotted 
time for the meeting was merely 30 minutes, 
and thanks to our leaders' non-stop talking, 
Indian Foreign Minister Dr. Jaishankar had 
little chance to speak.
"Jaishankar clearly told us that he chose Sri 
Lanka for his first foreign visit after being 
reappointed as the Foreign Minister of 
India because of India's 'Neighbourhood 
First' policy," one MP shared with the Jaffna 
Monitor. He added, "In my opinion, it seemed 
he was compelled to meet us to show Tamil 
Nadu and others that he had also engaged with 
Tamil leaders from the North during his brief 
one-day trip to Sri Lanka." The MP chuckled 
as he recounted the meeting, saying, "We 
were told the meeting would last 30 minutes, 
but our MPs should have let Jaishankar get a 
word in. Honestly, Jaishankar didn't say much. 
Out of 30 minutes, our MPs talked for 32," he 
joked.
The highlight of the meeting was the all-too-
familiar public disagreement between ITAK's 
two factions right in front of Jaishankar. 
One faction leader, Shritharan, confidently 
informed Jaishankar that they support a 
common Tamil candidate for the presidential 
election. This was immediately refuted by 
the other faction leader, Sumanthiran, who 
retorted, "We are opposing it." Jaishankar 
undoubtedly witnessed firsthand the dynamic 
Dr. S. Jaishankar with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a formal meeting, discussing bilateral relations and 
cooperation.</p>

and often dramatic nature of ITAK politics.
Meanwhile, TNPF's Kajendran voluntarily 
chimed in, stating that they also oppose 
the idea of a common Tamil candidate and 
are advocating for a boycott of the election. 
Out of curiosity, Jaishankar asked what was 
happening with the common Tamil candidate 
and whether they were serious about it. In 
response, C. V. Vigneswaran mentioned that 
the matter was still being discussed and that 
some civil society groups were involved.
Another Member of Parliament from the 
Jaffna district spoke to the Jaffna Monitor 
about his discussion with Indian Foreign 
Minister S. Jaishankar. He stated, "I requested 
the Indian government's assistance to 
enable the Provincial Council to function 
immediately. I also informed him that the 
three main presidential candidates in the 
upcoming Sri Lankan presidential electionâ€”
Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and 
Anura Kumara Dissanayakeâ€”agreed to make 
the Provincial Council operational. Minister 
Jaishankar listened to me patiently."
He continued, "I raised the issue of illegal land 
grabbing occurring in the North and East. 
Whether it's Vedukkunaari Hill in Mullaitivu, 
Thaiyiddy in Jaffna, or Mayilathamadu in the 
East, these are all part of a master plan to seize 
Sri Lankan Tamil lands. I emphasized this to 
Jaishankar, who has been a known friend of 
mine for more than two decades,' he said.
Another Tamil leader we spoke with had quite 
the tale to tell. While he told Jaishankar that 
their party was backing a common Tamil 
candidate, his private chat with the Jaffna 
Monitor revealed a different story. "I see it as 
a joke," he chuckled. "Firstly, some so-called 
civil society groups can't dictate what political 
leaders should doâ€”they have a different 
role to play. Secondly, if everyone agrees to 
nominate a common Tamil candidate, he must 
be a good one. While C. V. Vigneswaran is 
ready to contest, we all know he will end up 
being a joker, as always, in this election, too".
He went on to explain, "According to 
the constitution, anyone contesting the 
presidential election must be a former MP. 
These civil society leaders can't contest 
independently. If a civil society leader wants 
to run for president, they must do so under a 
party's banner. Suresh Premachandran, Leader 
of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation 
Front (EPRLF), mentioned that a common 
Tamil candidate could contest from his party, 
but it's yet to be seen how serious he is about 
this claim."
Continuing his candid assessment, he said, 
Dr. S. Jaishankar in deep discussion with former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.</p>

"If a Tamil candidate contests, he should at 
least secure 50% of the Tamil votes; otherwise, 
it will become a cruel joke. Currently, there 
is no universally accepted Tamil leader. For 
instance, Sampanthan, the Trinco MP of 
ITAK, could be a suitable candidate, but he is 
very old and fragile and will not contest."
Finally, he painted a vivid picture: "Assuming 
the Tamil voter base in the North and East is 
around ten lakhs, if eight lakhs of Tamils vote, 
the common Tamil candidate should secure at 
least half of those votes, which is four lakhs. 
However, there's no way a common Tamil 
candidate can garner that much support, and it 
will become a laughingstock."
When contacted by the Jaffna Monitor, 
another MP mentioned that he raised 
several concerns with Jaishankar. He said, "I 
emphasized the need for India to pressure Sri 
Lanka to implement the 13th Amendment. 
When implemented, Tamils can protect 
provincial lands, and schools and hospitals 
will be nationalized." Interestingly, his party 
had opposed this Amendment for years due 
to the fear of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam), who were against any political 
solution that did not include a separate state.
He added that Prime Minister Modi's third-
term victory significantly boosts Sri Lankan 
Tamils, creating unease among Sinhalese 
leaders. "The recent loose talks by hard-core 
Sinhala leaders like Wimal Weerawansa are a 
classic example of this unease," he noted.
We spoke with an Indian source close to 
Jaishankar regarding the Tamil MPs not letting 
Jaishankar speak. He remarked, "Jaishankar 
has been a diplomat for many years before 
assuming the role of External Affairs Minister 
of India. If anything needed to be conveyed, he 
is capable of doing so in just a few seconds or 
minutes. I don't know what happened inside 
the meeting as I was absent, but I'm very sure 
that if anything needed to be conveyed to 
the Tamil MPs, Jaishankar definitely would 
have done it. Also, he isn't unhappy about not 
getting much time to talk. In fact, the officer 
joked that it was a nice break for him from the 
usual diplomatic speeches, and he got to enjoy 
the show even if it was a bit of nonsense."
