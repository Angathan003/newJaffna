Your Vote, Your Voice: Don't Let 
This Election Pass You By
Dear Readers,
As Sri Lanka approaches the pivotal 2024 Presidential Election 
on September 21, our nation stands at a decisive juncture. This 
election holds the potential to fundamentally reshape the country's 
political landscape, marking it as one of the most consequential 
events in our democratic history. Unlike the commanding victories 
of the past, this year's contest is shrouded in uncertainty, with no 
clear frontrunner emerging. The stakes could not be higher, and 
the outcome remains far from predictable.
Historically, our presidential elections have often produced a 
decisive leader in the first round, with one candidate surpassing 
the 50% threshold. This time, however, with more than three 
candidates in the race, it's increasingly likely that no single 
candidate will secure an outright majority in the initial count. 
This opens the door for second and third preference votes to 
play a pivotal role in determining who will lead our nation. The 
importance of these preferences cannot be overstated—they could 
very well decide the future direction of Sri Lanka.
Your Vote Matters
At this critical moment, it is essential to understand the 
significance of every single vote. While you may support any 
candidate of your choice, it is crucial not to waste your valuable 
vote by boycotting the election, as some so-called Tamil 
nationalist parties are advocating. Remember, this is an election to 
choose the President of our country—a leader for all Sri Lankans.
We cannot afford to distance ourselves from the broader Sri 
Lankan narrative. As Tamils, we are an integral part of this 
nation, and our voices must be heard in the selection of our next 
leader. Voting for a common Tamil candidate who has no chance 
of winning, even if a miracle were to happen, is effectively 
equivalent to boycotting the election or marking your ballot

incorrectly. This strategy risks silencing our 
community in the national dialogue.
In our democratic society, both the 
majority and minority communities share 
responsibilities. Participating in this election 
is one such responsibility. We must ensure 
that our votes contribute meaningfully to the 
future of Sri Lanka—a future where we are all 
represented and heard.
How to Cast Your Vote
As we approach this crucial election, it's vital 
that every voter understands the voting process 
and casts their vote with clarity and purpose. 
Here's how to ensure your vote is counted:
• Mark Your First Choice: Place the number 
"1" in the box next to the name and symbol 
of the candidate you believe is best suited 
to lead our nation.
• Second and Third Choices (Optional): 
You have the option to indicate your 
second and third preferences by marking 
"2" and "3" next to the names of other 
candidates. However, marking only your 
first choice is sufficient for your vote to be 
counted.
The Election Commission has provided clear 
instructions: even if only the first preference is 
marked, the ballot remains valid. Additionally, 
if you choose to mark your first preference 
with an "X," as long as your intention is clear, 
your vote will still be counted.
Avoiding Common Mistakes
To ensure your vote is not invalidated, please 
be aware of the following key points:
• Do Not Leave the Ballot Blank: At a 
minimum, ensure your first preference is 
marked.
• Avoid Multiple First Choices: Marking 
more than one candidate as your first 
choice or using an "X" alongside a 
numerical preference will lead to your vote 
being rejected.
• Do Not Mark Only the Second or Third 
Preferences: A ballot that lacks a first 
preference but includes second or third 
preferences will be invalidated.
• Refrain from Using Identifying Marks: 
Any writing or symbols that could reveal 
your identity will disqualify your ballot.
• Correctly Mark Preferences: Use only 
"1," "2," and "3" for your choices. Avoid 
any other symbols or numbers.
• Stick to Three Preferences: Marking more 
than three preferences or using numbers 
beyond "3" will invalidate your vote.
These guidelines are designed to safeguard 
the integrity of your vote, ensuring that it is 
counted accurately and fairly. In a race where 
every single vote—and every preference—
could determine the outcome, it is your 
responsibility as a voter to be both informed 
and diligent.
At Jaffna Monitor, we urge every eligible 
voter to exercise their democratic rights. 
This election is more than just a choice—it 
is an opportunity to shape the future of our 
nation. Let your voice be heard, and let your 
aspirations be reflected in this pivotal election. 
Make your vote count.
