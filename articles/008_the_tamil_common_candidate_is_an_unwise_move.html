I didn't enter politics to serve any individual or 
group. I came into politics to serve the country.
Certainly not to serve the Rajapaksa brothers. 
When I entered politics, the country needed
something, and I believed I could contribute. 
That's why I stepped into this arena. I can't 
even put myself before my country, so how 
could I place anyone else above it? My loyalty 
is, and always will be, to the nation first.
After the Easter attacks, a systematic 
wave of hate was unleashed on the 
Sri Lankan Muslim community. In 
the subsequent government led by 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa, you were the 
only Muslim MP from the SLPP and 
the sole Muslim minister. You faced 
massive criticism both from the 
majority for being a Muslim and from 
within the Muslim community for 
joining a Sinhala-majority government, 
especially under a president who 
openly declared that he was elected 
solely by Sinhala votes. How did 
you personally cope with this dual 
pressure?
The opposition wanted this issue to remain 
unresolved so they could exploit it for political 
gain. That was their objective. My objective, 
however, was to find a solution and resolve the 
issue. If I had stayed outside the government 
and simply criticized them, my concerns 
would have been dismissed, and I would have 
been viewed as an adversary. By being part 
of the government and its Cabinet, I had the 
opportunity to raise these issues directly in 
cabinet meetings with key decision-makers.
When I was appointed Justice Minister, 
a section of Buddhist monks vehemently 
opposed it. They publicly stated that I should 
not be given the Justice Ministry. Even 
Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith expressed that I 
shouldn't be appointed. But why were they 
against me? Was I a criminal? Did I have any 
theft cases? No. They opposed me because 
I stood against the government's policy of 
forcibly cremating COVID-19 victims, a policy 
that deeply hurt the Muslim community's 
sentiments.
I gave an interview to Al Jazeera where I spoke 
out against the government's decision, and that
angered them. I even obtained a stay against 
an influential Buddhist monk, Ven. Madille 
Pannaloka Thera of the "Sinhale" organization 
who labelled me a terrorist simply because I
opposed the forced cremation policy. In court, 
he eventually stated that he would no longer 
make defamatory or insulting remarks against 
me.
I did what I could within the framework 
available to me. It's important to understand 
that the easiest thing to do is to walk away and 
then criticize from the outside. But I didn't do 
that. I became part of the system and tried to 
solve the problem. Finding a solution is the 
hardest thing to do, and that's what I aimed to 
achieve.
When you entered politics, you were 
one of the leading lawyers in the 
country, reportedly earning crores. 
Some political observers even joked 
that becoming a cabinet minister was 
"The Tamil common candidate is an unwise move."</p>

a financial loss for you. 
What motivated you to 
step into politics and take 
on the role of a cabinet 
minister? What were 
the reasons behind your 
decision?
There were two key factors at 
that time. Firstly, the Rajapaksa 
family, including Mahinda, 
Basil, and President Gotabaya, 
all requested my involvement. 
They acknowledged that 
although they were coming 
to power primarily with 
the Sinhala Buddhist vote, 
they didn't want to form a 
government solely based on 
that support. They wanted 
a balanced government. 
Douglas  Devananda was there 
to represent the Tamils, and 
Thondaman would represent 
the upcountry Tamils. But 
without my participation, the 
Muslim community would 
be unrepresented. That was a 
crucial call I had to make, and 
I understood its importance.
Secondly, I was deeply 
committed to reforming the 
justice sector. That was one of 
my primary aims. These two 
motivations- contributing 
to national unity and 
development, as well as my
desire to reform the justice 
system—drove me to step into 
the political arena and serve as 
a cabinet minister.
After the Easter attacks, the Sri Lankan Muslim 
community was unfairly targeted. While that 
is true, do you believe there is a systematic 
radicalization within the Muslim community? How 
do you view this issue, and if it exists, how do you 
plan to tackle it as a responsible representative of 
the Muslim community?
I wouldn't say there is a systematic radicalization within the 
Muslim community. However, there are individuals who 
become radicalized on their own, and in some cases, there 
are organized  efforts to radicalize others. While most of 
these individuals do not resort to violence, there are elements 
of isolation and extremism among some. We need to address 
these issues.</p>
