we journey into the heart of Vajra 
Chandrasekera's creative universe—exploring 
the genesis of his ideas, the inspirations that 
fuel his imagination, and his perspectives on 
the ever-evolving literary landscape. Join us as 
we step into the mind of a writer who dares to 
dream beyond the confines of reality.
Your short story, The Translator, at 
Low Tide was recently translated 
and published in the Tamil literary 
magazine Kaalachuvadu. Could you 
share your thoughts on having your 
work translated and reaching Tamil-
speaking audiences?
I’m absolutely delighted to have the story 
translated! Translation itself is a creative art 
form and, in a way, a magical act. Having 
done enough of it myself, I understand just 
how subtle and complex the process can be. 
It’s difficult to fully grasp how a story reads 
in a language you are not fluent in or well-
versed with, as you may not be familiar with 
its literary history or the context in which the 
story will be received. Trusting the translators, 
along with the editors and publishers who 
bring the work to new readers, is an essential 
part of that process. I deeply appreciate the 
dedication and effort of all the translators 
who have worked on my books and short 
stories over the past decade. Nearly all of 
these translations have been into European 
languages. This, however, is the first time my 
work has been translated into a South Asian 
language, making it both a new and deeply 
gratifying experience.
Your father was a writer, and you were 
involved in the publishing process 
from a young age. How did these 
experiences shape your journey as a 
writer?
In one sense, quite a lot—I gained an early 
understanding of the work involved from 
a writer’s perspective, including the effort 
required to draft, edit, revise, and proofread. 
I also picked up some technical insights, 
such as hearing my father talk about how he 
approached dialogue, description, and other 
aspects of writing. But from the perspective of 
commercial publishing, my father’s experience 
was entirely with local and regional small 
presses in the final decades of the previous 
century—a world that now feels almost like 
another planet. Knowing something about 
that didn’t prepare me at all for the far more 
complex experience of working with Western 
publishers in the present decade. Those things, 
I could only learn by doing.
Your novel The Saint of Bright Doors 
has received major accolades, 
including the 2023 Nebula Award, the 
2024 Crawford Award, and the Locus 
Award for Best First Novel. It was also 
a finalist for the 2024 Hugo Award. 
What do these honors mean to you as 
a writer, and have they influenced your 
approach to future projects?
They were all quite unexpected and deeply 
validating. I didn’t expect the book to make 
waves—most books don’t! I’m very happy 
for what the awards mean in terms of 
recognition, since these include both juried 
and popular awards. The award wins and 
nominations have significantly raised my 
profile as a debut author, and I believe have 
contributed to getting the book in front of 
more people in many practical ways: more</p>

bookshops and libraries stocking copies, more 
publishers around the world making offers on 
translations, more book clubs, more media. 
All of this is wonderful, and far more than I 
expected. Luck plays a disproportionately huge 
role in a writer’s career, and I’ve been very 
lucky.
Traditionally, Sri Lankan writers have 
predominantly explored current or 
historical themes in their stories 
and novels, with science fiction 
being a rare genre within the literary 
landscape. What inspired you to take 
this unconventional path and write 
science fiction? Was there a specific 
moment, influence, or realization that 
led you to embrace this genre?
I don’t think of it as a particularly 
unconventional path. Quite a few writers 
from Sri Lanka (both living on the island and 
from the diaspora) have published speculative 
fiction in a variety of styles and spaces over 
the last twenty years: I made a list of some of 
these writers on my blog the year Saint came 
out. There are many more in South Asia in 
general, and around the world. Speculative and 
fantastical literatures are quite popular among 
both readers and writers. More technically, 
I prefer fantastical to naturalistic registers 
because it makes it possible to create a much 
more layered symbolic space. To me, strict<br />
realism is the exception. It can be a fruitful set 
of formal constraints, and certainly it remains 
the culturally highest-prestige form, but then 
again, the times are certainly changing: look 
at all the recent Booker winners that were 
in some way speculative fiction, including 
Shehan Karunatilaka with a ghost detective 
story.
What is your outlook for science 
fiction in Sri Lanka? Do you perceive 
a growing interest in the genre, 
particularly among the younger 
generations?
I don’t really know. I’ve never published here 
and have very little insight into the local 
industry or readership—most of my readers 
are elsewhere. In general, I’d guess that, like 
everywhere else, traditional science fiction, 
especially space opera, might feel somewhat 
old-fashioned to younger readers, much like 
epic fantasy, since these genres have been 
mainstream for the past forty years. I think 
their core readership now skews older on a 
global scale.
My vague impression from the last Colombo 
Book Fair was that romantasy and shonen 
manga are just as popular here as anywhere 
else, alongside prestige literary fiction, 
including literary-speculative authors like 
Atwood and Ishiguro. These seem to be 
the most sought-after foreign fiction titles. 
Otherwise, the selection of modern speculative 
fiction across subgenres appears quite thin 
on local shelves, likely due to low demand. 
Whether that reflects an actual lack of interest 
or simply the fact that readers are opting for 
ebooks instead is hard to say.
How do you view science fiction as 
a platform for exploring themes or 
ideas that might be difficult to address 
within the confines of more traditional 
narratives? In what ways do you 
think the speculative nature of the 
genre allows for a deeper or broader 
engagement with complex social,</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

cultural, or philosophical issues?
I don’t think it does. I think any theme can 
be addressed in any form or genre. It’s just 
that each writer and reader will find different 
approaches more pleasurable or interesting. 
Strict naturalism is a powerful technique, 
obviously, and has given us a wide range of 
social and political novels that have a great 
deal to say. Speculation is also a powerful 
technique, and in many ways an easier and 
more traditional one, if you think of it as 
drawing from allegory and satire more 
than design fiction. I think it appeals 
more to readers and writers who 
enjoy a greater degree of ontological 
freedom in their fictive dream. In 
strict naturalism, a door is literally a 
door and perhaps symbolically also 
a door. In the fantastic, the door’s 
symbolic meaning can become real, 
which allows for the possibility of second-
order speculative consequences: what 
could be on the other side of a door that 
can never be opened? Speculative fiction 
also increases the range of a kind of 
indirect political fiction, similar to 
the methods of the misty poets in 
China or the magic realists of South 
America. The difference is of technique, 
and therefore a matter of preference.
How much of your personal 
experiences or cultural background 
influences the worlds and characters 
you create? Are there elements from 
Sri Lankan history or mythology 
that you consciously integrate 
into your speculative fiction?
Yes, of course! My books are full 
of Sri Lankan and South Asian 
references, historical, mythic, and personal, 
to the point where western readers often 
say (and only some of them mean this as a 
complaint) that they have to look things up to 
understand them. In Rakesfall I make fairly 
direct connections to Sri Lankan folk tales 
and histories, as well as the Ramayana, and 
the Kathasaritsaga. In The Saint of Bright 
Doors I retell a version of the story of Prince 
Vijaya’s arrival on the island. I do this sort of 
thing so much 
I can’t even remember all 
the allusions I’ve 
included:

stories that make reference to other stories 
nearly as much as I enjoy stories within stories.
While you primarily write in English, 
what is your perspective on science 
fiction in local languages?
I think it’s a great thing, and I wish there 
were more of it—along with greater coverage. 
A thriving literary culture in any language 
should encompass many forms and genres, 
including fantastical literatures. I know there 
are science fiction novels in Sinhala, though 
they seem relatively rare. I’d assume the same 
is true for Tamil in Sri Lanka, though there’s 
certainly more activity in India on that front.
One upcoming anthology I’m particularly 
excited about is The Blaft Book of Anti-Caste 
Science Fiction from Blaft Publications in 
Chennai, which features speculative fiction 
in English translation from Tamil, Telugu, 
Malayalam, and other languages. I wish all 
our regional publishing industries, especially 
small presses, had more support and funding 
to publish and translate such works. The Blaft 
anthology was crowdfunded online, which 
might offer a viable path forward for similar 
projects. Interestingly, the publisher recently 
noted that a significant number of orders 
came from outside India—an encouraging 
sign of growing international interest in these 
literatures.
On a global scale, how have the 
science fiction and speculative fiction 
genres evolved over time? What 
significant trends or shifts have you 
observed, and how do they resonate 
with your own work?
It’s a long history, regardless on whether you 
begin from the Epic of Gilgamesh or from 
Frankenstein—personally, I like to begin 
from Lucian of Samosata’s A True Story, but 
it doesn’t matter: this kind of story has been a 
part of literature for as long as literature itself 
has existed. I would argue that fantastical 
literatures are the standard and original 
form of the story: literary realism is the real 
nineteenth-century innovation, and has in 
turn spurred new kinds of fantastical literature 
using its toolkit.
There have been some big shifts in publishing 
over the 20th century as the industry itself 
evolved, and there are definitely many smaller 
movements and trends, but I think ultimately 
they don’t matter so much. Many of the year-
on-year trends are driven by marketing, in 
any case, and represent not much more than 
publishers attempting to reproduce recent 
successes by producing more of the same. 
This works to a limited extent and then they 
move on to something else. For writers, I think 
it’s important to disengage from these cycles 
when writing. Even from a purely commercial 
standpoint, because given the extended 
timelines to finish a work, sell it, and then 
have it arrive in bookstores, you usually can’t 
even catch a commercial trend that’s already 
happening. On the plus side, it also means that 
for the most part you can just ignore the short-
term trends and write what you want to.
The biggest changes in recent decades, I 
think, have been that first, modern novelistic 
fantastic literature is nowadays allowed much 
more freely into prestige cultural spaces (like 
the Booker, as I mentioned earlier)  and these 
genre lines are much blurrier than they used to 
be, and that’s a good thing in both directions.
Secondly, also as I spoke of earlier: especially 
over the last twenty years, there has been a 
distinct shift toward a more international 
field as the internet democratized access to</p>

publishing. While the industry continues to 
have many problems, we can at least say that 
publishing is much less limited by location 
than it used to be. I think I’ve benefited from 
both of those changes, and I’m hopeful that 
they mean new opportunities for many more 
writers.
In a previous interview, you mentioned that as 
you grew older, your parents encouraged you 
to pursue what they considered “acceptable” 
careers—such as becoming a doctor, lawyer, or 
engineer.
With the creative economy evolving 
in recent years, do you feel it has 
become more feasible for writers to 
pursue their craft as a sole profession 
while achieving financial stability? 
Moreover, does the mindset of parents 
encouraging traditional career paths 
still persist, and how do you think 
it impacts the creative aspirations 
and career choices of younger 
generations?
I think that mindset is an understandable 
intergenerational disconnect under modernity. 
Technological and social change is constant 
and ever more volatile, and it’s much easier to 
take career risks for yourself than it is to watch 
your loved ones do it, especially if you feel 
responsible for their future well-being.
One consequence of accelerating neoliberalism 
is that all jobs are worse than they used to be. 
You get paid less, relative to cost of living, and 
you have less job security, if any at all. Creative 
work is no exception: it’s precarious, often 
exploitative, and extremely unpredictable. I 
would definitely say that writing is not a good 
line of work if you want financial stability. 
Some other kind of paying work is still quite 
necessary if you want to pursue any kind of 
artistic career. My only modification to my 
parents’ advice would be to think in terms of 
freelance or contract work where you get to set 
your own hours, rather than working toward 
the kind of full-time job which will demand 
all your energy and time. But even that 
modification is really just a reflection of the 
changing nature of work in general. Personally, 
my main side gig was freelance editing, mostly 
in nonfiction.
 That said, I do think this is a particularly 
good moment for writers who live in the third 
world, because first-world publishing is far 
more accessible to us now than it has ever 
been, as the industry has very slowly adapted 
to the internet. All the information you need 
is online, you can email manuscripts, sign</p>

contracts digitally, attend virtual events, talk to 
writers, translators, and people in the industry 
on social media—you no longer need to have 
physical access to major centres of western 
publishing like New York or London to be able 
to get an agent or get your work in front of 
an editor; you don’t need to go to conferences 
or conventions on the other side of the world 
to meet people who can help you; you don’t 
even need to spend money on postage to send 
your manuscripts out. It’s not surprising to see 
the sharp increase in books written by writers 
from South Asia coming out in the US and 
UK markets now. Even a decade ago that was 
much rarer. I hope to see a lot more writers 
from this part of the world taking advantage of 
these opportunities in every genre.
What opportunities and challenges 
do you think artificial intelligence (AI) 
presents for writers, particularly those 
working in the science fiction genre? 
Do you see the potential for leveraging 
AI responsibly in the creative process, 
and if so, how might that manifest 
in practice? Furthermore, some 
technology experts predict that AI 
could eventually write as effectively as 
human writers. Do you agree with this 
perspective, and how do you envision 
it shaping the future of writing and 
storytelling?
I am strongly opposed to AI in any way 
connected to creative work. (I’m also opposed 
to AI in general, as I think it is an execrable 
technology that will only introduce and 
compound error wherever it is used, but I 
am more resigned to this as part of silicon 
neoliberalism’s natural enshittification.)
Writing fiction is a very long sequence of 
decisions, some minor, some complex. AI-
generated text represents the abandonment of 
all those decisions in exchange for a statistical 
smear that unthinkingly approximates the 
combined product of many such past decisions 
by many other people with wildly different 
concerns. It is an abdication of responsibility 
as an artist: why should anyone care to read 
something that you didn’t care to write? The 
“product” may look the same at a distant, 
superficial glance. You can paint a brick to 
look like a cake. But it will not feed you when 
you are hungry.
I understand the appeal of AI to people who 
romanticize the idea of being a writer, as a 
social role (or a visual artist, or a musician)—
people who believe that there is prestige 
or cultural cachet or money or something 
desirable about it other than the act of 
writing itself. They don’t want to write but 
they want to be a writer, and to this end they 
persuade themselves that the writing itself is 
unnecessary. Like a middle manager who gives 
instructions to other people to do the work 
and then takes credit for what they produce. 
But ultimately the benefit accrues only to 
the upper management boss they don’t even 
acknowledge: the companies that own the AI 
technology, who will use all that data to train 
the AI and make it more profitable.
The danger of AI is not in science-fictional 
apocalypses of the robots taking over. (If 
such a thing is possible, it’s certainly not 
going to happen because we have a glorified 
autocomplete.) The danger is that this is a new 
weapon that employers can use to make work 
more precarious in many different fields. It 
gives them the means to fire more people and 
rehire them as contractors on worse terms 
to “fix” the AI’s output. This turns more full-
time jobs into contract jobs and drives down</p>

freelance rates. It generates profit for people at 
the other end of this value-extraction chain, 
by making it much harder for a wide variety of 
white-collar workers (not only in the creative 
fields) to have stable work for decent pay.
Specifically in the creative fields, an additional 
danger is that it will significantly damage the 
ecosystem of small gigs and side projects that 
many fledgeling artists use both as additional 
sources of revenue as well as an arena in 
which to practice and improve their skills. 
Many a writer has survived on copywriting 
gigs, many a visual artist makes posters and 
graphics to get by, and 
so 
on. In the process you 
practice your skills at 
basic levels, learn your 
tools, some essential 
secondary skills—
from meeting a 
deadline to chasing a 
payment. The world 
already 
strongly disincentivizes people from becoming 
artists. The real AI apocalypse is that we could 
lose a generation of potential artists and gain a 
generation of smug, illiterate dipshits in their 
place.
There are additional dangers and concerns 
with AI (environmental damage to both the 
earth and the internet, for instance), but this 
is probably already my longest response, so I’ll 
stop here. My advice to writers in any genre 
is to treat AI as the revolting slop bucket it is, 
and to do your work the same way writers in 
every language and under every imaginable 
circumstance have done for thousands of 
years: by writing, one line at a time.
Your novels, The Saint of Bright Doors 
and Rakesfall, delve into profound 
themes of reincarnation and struggles 
for liberation. What draws you to these 
recurring themes, and how do they 
reflect your perspectives on identity 
and societal structures? In what 
ways do you believe the speculative 
fiction genre uniquely facilitates the 
exploration of such multifaceted 
ideas?
I don’t think speculative fiction has a 
greater grasp of these things than any 
other form or genre, but I do—as a 
writer and as a reader myself—appreciate 
the particular tactility and purchase 
that the techniques of speculative 
fiction provide on their grippable 
surfaces. Though a great deal of 
ostensibly realist fiction also 
often makes space for irreal, 
symbolic irruption. Few stories 
are altogether straight. I think</p>

it’s more useful to think of genre as a set of 
traditions and some loose guidelines rather 
than something that has strict boundaries. 
And I’ve lived in Sri Lanka all my life, with 
an altogether too close-up view of Sinhala 
Buddhist supremacist culture, so it will 
probably always be impossible for me to write 
a book that doesn’t talk in some way about 
power as I’ve understood it—the violence 
of empires and states through genocide, 
apartheid, and ideology.
You have also published occasional 
poems alongside your fiction. How do 
you perceive the role of poetry in your 
body of work? Does it serve a different 
purpose or occupy a unique creative 
space compared to your fiction?
I consider poetry in many ways the 
fundamental creative form in language, in the 
way that mathematics underlies physics but 
is also its own discipline. All prose derives 
from the poetic act: every word was once, and 
secretly still is, a poem. I don’t write a lot of 
poetry qua poetry—I find it more difficult—
or think of myself as a poet, but I do believe 
that one of the great pleasures of prose is in 
this revelation of obscured beauties, of secret 
rhythms.
What can your readers look forward 
to in your upcoming works? Are there 
specific themes or genres you are 
eager to explore further, or perhaps 
new creative directions that you’re 
considering venturing into?
I’m working on a novel that I hope to have out 
soon (no earlier than ’26), that will be formally 
and thematically similar to my first two 
books. Broadly, I work freely with the various 
elements of “speculative fiction”—science 
fiction, fantasy, horror, and the weird—and 
integrate them with writing about place, 
culture, and history in a Sri Lankan and South 
Asian context. This is my project for at least a 
few more books to come, so I want to do more 
of it as well as do more with it. Oh, and I also 
hope to publish a collection of my short stories 
soon; they do tend to get overshadowed by the 
novels, and I think it would be nice to have 
a selection in book form that will hopefully 
reach a few more readers.
Your command of English is 
remarkable, and it reflects beautifully 
in your writing. Could you share how 
you developed such proficiency? Was 
your education primarily in English, or 
did you learn and refine the language 
on your own? Additionally, what 
advice would you offer to younger 
generations aspiring to master 
English, particularly those who wish 
to use it as a medium for creative 
expression and storytelling? Are there 
specific practices or resources you 
recommend?
Thank you! That’s very kind of you to say. No, 
my formal education was entirely in Sinhala. 
I went to a government school in Colombo 
and stopped my education after my A/Ls, at 
which I did not score particularly well. My 
parents sent me to English classes at a young 
age, and were themselves fluent (though my 
father was not necessarily comfortable in it.) 
But most of all, there were a lot of English 
books at home. Some came from book fairs 
and second-hand bookshops; some came from</p>

boxes of books inherited from dead relatives 
with eccentric taste. And of course, libraries. I 
progressed on my own from children’s books 
to adult novels, and my love of speculative 
fiction probably helped nudge me toward 
English novels quite early. For example, I read 
Arthur C. Clarke for the first time in Sinhala 
translation, but I realised that if I wanted to 
read his other books, other classic writers of 
that period, or any newer writers at all, they 
were only available in English. And of course, 
as a historical consequence, there is just so 
much more fiction available in English, in 
every genre, including translations from other 
languages.
So my advice is primarily just to read as much 
as you can, and as widely as you can. Most 
people read at best a handful of books every 
year. A writer—at least, one who wants to get 
good at it—should be reading at least several 
dozen. There is no upper limit to reading 
except those imposed by time and money, but 
practically speaking, there is definitely a lower 
limit.
A specific practice I’d recommend for writers 
of short fiction in English—and I do think 
every beginning writer of prose fiction should 
at least try their hand at the short story, even if 
you see yourself primarily as a novelist—is to 
actively send your work to magazines from the 
very beginning. You will get a lot of rejections, 
but that’s normal. It’s not personal: every 
writer collects hundreds of these. It just means 
that you’re a working writer.
The rules of the game are simple: keep writing 
new stories (do not endlessly “polish” the 
last thing you wrote) and keep sending those 
stories out for publication (do not give up on a 
story unless its rejections are at least in the low 
double digits.)
Below are a few free resources that track 
opportunities for publication. Each will have 
their own submission guidelines, so be sure 
to read those and make sure you’re giving 
them exactly what they ask for. Note: avoid 
anything that has a submission fee. You, the 
writer, should not be spending any money to 
get published, and there are a lot of scams out 
there. Links you find from the databases below 
should be generally reliable.
