I
n an electrifying display of talent and 
showmanship, West Indies' newest cricket 
sensation, Kevin Sinclair, etched his name 
into the annals of Test cricket history with one 
of the most spectacular wicket celebrations 
ever witnessed. Making his Test debut a 
memorable saga, Sinclair not only scored an 
impressive half-century but also clinched his 
first Test wicket, outsmarting the accomplished 
Australian batsman Usman Khawaja.
But the 24-year-old's magic moment didn't 
end there. The Gabba crowd was treated to a 
jaw-dropping spectacle as Sinclair performed 
an awe-inspiring backflip, a celebration that 
sent waves of excitement through the stadium. 
Renowned commentators were quick to 
express their amazement. Michael Vaughan 
exclaimed, "What a celebration!" Allan Border, 
a legend of the game, couldn't contain his 
admiration, declaring, "That has got to be the 
best (celebration) ever. That is the best ever." 
Ian Smith joined in, acknowledging, "We've 
just seen one of the great celebrations of all 
time."
This spectacular feat by Sinclair didn't just 
light up the stadium; it set the entire cricketing 
world abuzz, particularly among Sri Lankan 
fans, who found themselves in a whirlwind 
of hilarious debates and daydreams. They 
playfully pondered which of their own 
cricketers could match Sinclair's aerial 
acrobatics. The chatter swerved into a comical 
lane, with fans teasingly suggesting that 
before Sri Lankan players even think about 
attempting such gravity-defying stunts, they 
might want to brush up on something a bit 
more fundamental – like sprinting between the 
wickets without huffing and puffing!

Mahathaya's Saga:
Power, Paranoia, and Politics in the LTTE

R&amp;AW's PsyOps and the Seeds of Paranoia
The Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), serving as India's 
premier foreign intelligence entity, is understood to have 
executed a series of psychological operations aimed at the 
upper echelons of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE). These operations, multifaceted in their approach, 
were strategically deployed across various fronts.

In one instance, On July 29, 1989, 'The Hindu,' 
one of India's most esteemed newspapers, 
published a news with the headline, 
"Prabhakaran Killed in LTTE Shootout." This 
headline cited Lalith Athulathmudali, the 
then Agriculture Minister and a prominent 
Sinhala nationalist politician. He claimed that 
allegedly intercepted radio messages from the 
LTTE indicated that Velupillai Prabhakaran, 
the LTTE leader, had been assassinated by his 
second-in-command, Mahathaya, amid an 
internal power struggle. The report further 
emphasized that Mahathaya had become a 
key figure in the LTTE's military hierarchy, 
reportedly achieving parity with Prabhakaran 
in military matters. 
Based on information from reliable insiders 
formerly close to the LTTE leadership, 
the Psychological Operations (PSYOP) 
engineered by R&amp;AW successfully instilled 
deep-seated paranoia in Prabhakaran's 
mind. Consequently, even a small part of 
Prabhakaran began to consider the possibility 
that Mahathaya might truly be conspiring 
against him, influenced by these strategically 
disseminated yet false reports.
This suspicion was further fueled by key 
figures close to Prabhakaran, including 
Tamilselvan, the then leader of the LTTE's 
political wing, Pottu Amman, the chief of 
the intelligence wing, and Shankar, also 
known as 'Thagaadu' Shankar. Their natural 
aversion towards Mahathaya and their 
vested interests played a significant role in 
escalating Prabhakaran's mistrust. Notably, 
Pottu Amman harboured ambitions to rise to 
Mahathaya's position within the LTTE, adding 
a layer of personal agenda to the unfolding 
drama.
Concurrently, Mahathaya voiced his 
disillusionment with the LTTE's leadership 
in internal discussions. This period marked 
a phase where he openly articulated his 
frustrations and disappointments, stemming 
from a variety of underlying reasons. His

criticisms, coming at a time of heightened 
internal distrust, only served to exacerbate 
the tensions within the upper echelons of the 
LTTE.
War Resurges, PFLT Disbands
On June 11, 1990, a significant shift occurred 
in the relationship between the Premadasa 
government and the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), marking the end of a 
period of relative calm and leading to the 
resurgence of armed conflict. The Sri Lankan 
military successfully captured key islands 
surrounding the Jaffna Peninsula, including 
Mandaitivu. This escalation of war resulted in 
the suspension of operations of the People's 
Front of Liberation Tigers (PFLT), the political 
faction of the LTTE. Consequently, LTTE 
members who were previously engaged in 
political activities under the PFLT banner 
returned to armed combat. Among the key 
figures who lost their life was Captain Sunthari 
(Udayalashmi Urrutrapati), who served on 
the Executive Committee of the PFLT and was 
also the sister of Idea Vasu, a notable member 
of the LTTE. Idea Vasu tragically lost his life 
in an explosion that occurred while he was 
refuelling an LTTE vehicle in Navatkuli, Jaffna, 
on February 14, 1987. Additionally, another 
sibling of Sunthari, James, an LTTE combatant, 
was killed in 1990. Captain Sunthari's own life 
came to a dramatic and tragic conclusion on 
December 19, 1990. In a grave turn of events, 
she died in Kurumbasiddy, Jaffna, after biting a 
cyanide capsule. Sources suggest that the death 
of Captain Sunthari, a member of the PFTL's 
executive committee who went to war and 
died, indicates that the organization effectively 
ceased to exist following the outbreak of war 
despite never being officially disbanded.

Sudden Disbandment

formation of the PFLT 
reported that the party was 
established quite abruptly 
and not in a serious 
manner. Specifically, the 
party was conceptualized 
during a lunch meeting 
at Prabhakaran's base, 
'Punithabhoomi,' in 
Nittakaikkulam, Mullaitivu. 
This development followed 
discussions between LTTE 
representatives and envoys 
of President Premadasa. 
The Sri Lankan government 
delegation had suggested 
that the LTTE form a 
political party to advance 
ongoing negotiations further.
Eager to expel Indian troops from the country, 
Prabhakaran sought to ally with the Sri Lankan 
government under Premadasa. After being 
briefed about the discussions, he quickly 
established the PFLT, appointing Mahathaya as 
its founder and leader and Yogi Yogarathinam 
as its secretary. Furthermore, leaders from the 
LTTE's district political wings were appointed 
to the Executive Committee.
To officially register the political party, a larger 
executive committee was necessary. As a 
result, Sunthari and Jeya, a prominent LTTE 
member who now resides in Canada, were 
also appointed to the central committee by 
Prabhakaran. However, the source emphasised 
Prabhakaran's apparent lack of genuine 
commitment to both the party and the peace 
talks.
An insider within the LTTE told the Jaffna 
Monitor that the informal disbanding of the 
LTTE's political party, the PFLT, occurred 
as abruptly as its formation. In a move 
characteristic of his autocratic leadership 
style, Prabhakaran one day summoned his 
senior officials and declared the immediate 
cessation of the PFLT's operations. He ordered 
the closure of all party branches and directed 
that representatives serving the public be 
relieved of their duties. Notably, Mahathaya, 
the founder and leader of the PFLT, was given 
no explanation or opportunity for discussion 
regarding this decision. The source further 
indicated that Prabhakaran's unilateral action 
deeply disheartened Mahathaya. 
 The same source also shared a noteworthy 
story with the Jaffna Monitor, revealing that 
Prabhakaran had intentions to reignite the 
war earlier. However, he delayed his plans as 
the LTTE was expecting a significant sum 
of money amounting to crores from the 
Premadasa government. The transaction was 
being given to Jude, a prominent member 
of Mahathaya's faction within the LTTE. 
Prabhakaran reportedly waited for the funds 
to be securely transferred to the LTTE before 
initiating conflict, which eventually erupted on 
June 11, 1990.

Dissonance and Disappearance of 
Mahathaya
During this period, Mahathaya notably 
receded from the public eye, as observed by 
sources and reported in the Jaffna newspapers. 
He was conspicuously absent from media 
coverage in Jaffna. While he had a personal 
security detail of many LTTE cadres, 
Mahathaya limited his public appearances, 
often accompanied by just a few of them. He 
deliberately avoided public events, especially 
those attended by Prabhakaran.
Sources within the LTTE, speaking to the 
Jaffna Monitor, indicated a growing rift 
between Mahathaya and Prabhakaran. They 
were reportedly not on speaking terms, with 
Mahathaya expecting Prabhakaran to initiate 
a conversation while Prabhakaran awaited 
Mahathaya's approach. Opinions varied on the 
nature of this disagreement – some likened 
it to a minor family dispute, while others 
considered it more serious.
Credible reports suggested that Pottu Amman, 
head of the LTTE's intelligence wing, exploited 
this discord, systematically disparaging 
Mahathaya to Prabhakaran. Mahathaya, 
described as both adamant and naïve, seemed 
either oblivious to the brewing conspiracy or 
chose to disregard it. 
A former member of Mahathaya's faction, 
who served in a communications capacity, 
inadvertently overheard conversations by 
the LTTE's upper echelons suggesting an 
impending move against Mahathaya and 
his team. Recognizing the peril, he sought 
reassignment to the front lines. Speaking to the 
Jaffna Monitor, he expressed that his proactive 
decision likely spared him from the fate that 
befell many in Mahathaya's faction. Had he not 
taken this action, he believed he would have 
been ensnared by Pottu Amman's intelligence 
network, leading to his eventual arrest and 
execution, a fate endured by hundreds of 
fighters from Mahathaya's group.
The situation escalated dramatically on 
the night of August 2 and 3, 1993. In a 
meticulously executed operation resembling 
a full-scale military assault, the LTTE 
apprehended Mahathaya.
