Rajavarothayam Sampanthan, a towering 
figure in Tamil politics known affectionately 
as 'Perunthalaivar' (Great Leader), passed 
away peacefully in Colombo on June 30, 
2024. At the age of 91 years and 4 months, 
Sampanthan was one of the last prominent 
leaders from the era of Thanthai Chelva (S. J. 
V. Chelvanayakam).
Sampanthan had been in poor health for a 
considerable period and had been wheelchair-
bound for several years. His health issues had 
notably caused him to miss parliamentary 
duties and important meetings. An example 
was an important meeting with the newly 
reappointed Indian External Affairs Minister, 
S. Jaishankar, three weeks before his death. 
Sources close to Sampanthan mentioned that 
he was prepared with notes for this meeting, 
but his ailing health ultimately prevented him 
from attending.
Sampanthan's last interview was with the 
leading Tamil newspaper, Virakesari, a few 
weeks before his passing. The interview 
was titled 'jkpo; nghJNtl;ghsuhy; 
jkpou;fSf;F vd;d gad;?" ("What Benefit 
Do Tamils Gain from a Common Tamil 
Candidate?"). The interviewer, journalist R. 
Ram, shared with the Jaffna Monitor that

despite Sampanthan's physical struggles and 
declining health, his mental faculties were 
remarkably sharp. 
R. Ram recounted that Sampanthan's memory 
was impeccable; he recalled events and details 
with precision, and his responses to the most 
challenging and politically nuanced questions 
were delivered with astuteness and clarity. Ram 
noted that Sampanthan's answers reflected a 
profound understanding and insight into the 
political landscape. Remarkably, Sampanthan 
even remembered dates and 
times from the past with 
striking accuracy. Despite 
occasional moments when 
his speech was initially 
unclear, a repeated sentence 
would become perfectly 
comprehensible, showcasing 
his enduring acumen and 
experience. R.Ram added.
However, Ram also observed 
Sampanthan's physical 
fragility. While his mind 
remained as sharp as ever, 
his body was frail, a testament to the toll 
that age and illness had taken on him. This 
juxtaposition of a keen intellect housed in a 
weakened body highlighted, Ram pointed out, 
the indomitable spirit of a leader who, even 
in his final days, remained deeply engaged 
and committed to the causes he championed 
throughout his life.
From East to Eminence: Sampanthan's 
Political Legacy
Sampanthan, arguably the first and only 
leader to rise to the pinnacle of Tamil politics 
from Sri Lanka's eastern region, represented 
a significant departure from the established 
norm. Historically, Tamil political leadership, 
including figures such as 'Thanthai' S. J. V. 
Chelvanayakam, Amirthalingam, and even 
LTTE's Prabhakaran during the armed 
struggle, predominantly emerged from the 
northern regions.
Sampanthan was a distinguished representative 
of Sri Lanka's eastern Trincomalee district and 
served as the Parliamentary group leader of 
the Ilankai Tamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK), also 
known in English as the Federal Party (FP)—a 
translation that is politically motivated and not 
entirely accurate.
Rajavarothayam Sampanthan 
was born in Trincomalee 
on February 5, 1933, as the 
eldest of seven children. His 
father, A. Rajavarothayam, 
served in the government 
during British colonial 
rule and retired post-
independence as the 
Superintendent of Stores 
at the Gal Oya Dam and 
Reservoir Construction 
scheme. This position 
afforded young Sampanthan a diverse and 
comprehensive education.
Sampanthan's early education took him to 
several prestigious institutions. He began his 
primary schooling in Jaffna and continued his 
education at St. Patrick's College in Jaffna, St. 
Anne's College in Kurunegala, and St. Joseph's 
College in Trincomalee. His secondary 
education culminated at St. Sebastian's 
College in Moratuwa, known for its academic 
excellence.
Following his secondary education, 
Sampanthan entered Ceylon Law College. 
During this era, before the title of Attorney-at-
Law was established, he graduated as a proctor 
in the late 1950s.

Sampanthan returned to his hometown of 
Trincomalee to commence his legal practice. 
His adept legal skills and dedication quickly 
earned him a reputation as one of the most 
popular and respected lawyers in the area. 
Sampanthan's political career is distinguished 
by its remarkable duration and significant 
impact. He served as a Member of Parliament 
for the Trincomalee electorate from 1977 to 
1983, and subsequently as the Trincomalee 
district MP from 1997 to 2000, and again from 
2001 until his passing in 2024. In total, his 
parliamentary service spanned over 32 years.
From 2004 to 2014, Sampanthan held the 
position of leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasuk 
Katchi (ITAK). Although he resigned from 
this role in September 2014, he continued 
to lead the now-uncertain Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA), in which ITAK was the chief 
constituent party.
During his tenure, Sampanthan played a 
crucial role in navigating the Tamil political 
landscape and advocating for Tamil rights 
within his capacity. His style of politics—
negotiating without angering the majority 
community or its politicians- starkly 
contrasted with Prabhakaran's slash-and-burn 
approach and was often frustrating for those 
accustomed to LTTE's school of politics.
His leadership extended to being the leader 
of the Opposition in Parliament from 2015 
to 2019, during which he played a crucial 
but ultimately unsuccessful role in national 
politics.
Sampanthan's Political Journey and 
the Sri Lankan Tamils' Story 
At just 23 years old, Rajavarothayam 
Sampanthan joined the Illankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK) in 1956, the very year Prime 
Minister SWRD. Bandaranaike's government 
enacted the Sinhala Only Act. This ill-

conceived piece of legislation effectively laid 
the groundwork for Sri Lanka's enduring 
ethnic conflict. The Act insidiously declared 
Sinhala as the sole official language of Sri 
Lanka, marginalizing the Tamil-speaking 
population and stripping them of their 
linguistic and cultural rights.
This controversial and inflammatory 
legislation sent shockwaves through the 
Tamil community, fueling ethnic tensions and 
sparking protests. For the Tamil community, 
the Sinhala Only Act was a direct attack on 
their identity and existence within Sri Lanka. 
It led to widespread unrest and violence, 
deeply embedding a sense of injustice and 
alienation among Tamils. It is important to 
remember that before this Act, Tamils were 
not advocating for Tamil Eelam—a separate 
country for Sri Lankan Tamils. In fact, it is 
doubtful that the term "Tamil Eelam" was even 
in the lexicon of Sri Lankan Tamils before this 
evil Act was enacted.
The Reluctant Politician: Sampanthan's 
Journey from Law to Leadership
Thanthai Chelva, the then de facto Leader 
of Sri Lankan Tamils, saw potential in the 
most sought-after and popular civil and 
criminal legal practitioner, Rajavarothayam 
Sampanthan, who initially resisted entering 
politics despite close familial ties to prominent 
politicians. His uncle, S. Sivapalan, was the 
first MP for Trincomalee, elected in 1947 
from the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC).

Sampanthan's cousin, N. R. Rajavarothayam, later defeated 
Sivapalan in the 1952 election as an ITAK candidate. Both men 
were closely related to Sampanthan and to each other.
When N. R. Rajavarothayam passed away in 1963, ITAK 
leader S.J.V. Chelvanayakam urged Sampanthan to run for 
the vacant seat, but he declined. S.M. Manickarajah won 
the by-election instead and was re-elected in 1965. Upon 
Manickarajah's retirement in 1970, Chelvanayakam again

N. R. Rajavarothayam
invited Sampanthan to 
stand as the ITAK candidate 
for Trincomalee. Again, 
Sampanthan declined, and 
B. Neminathan won the 
seat.
In 1976, Chelvanayakam 
secured Sampanthan's 
commitment to run for 
Trincomalee, with the 
support of his political heir, 
Appapillai Amirthalingam. 
Sampanthan finally agreed, 
marking the beginning of 
his distinguished political 
career. Reflecting on this 
decision, Sampanthan once 
said, "Politics, I always 
thought, was not my game, 
and my heart was in the 
courthouse. The politician 
whom I respected most, 
Thanthai Chelva, changed 
the entire course of my life.

parties, including the ITAK, Ceylon Workers 
Congress (CWC), and All Ceylon Tamil 
Congress (ACTC), formed the Tamil United 
Front (TUF) under the joint leadership of S. 
J. V. Chelvanayakam, S. Thondaman, and G. 
G. Ponnambalam. The TUF later changed 
its name to Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF) and adopted the demand for an 
independent Tamil state, the "secular, socialist 
state of Tamil Eelam." However, the CWC 
declined to support the newly formed TULF 
and left the coalition.
Sampanthan's Entry into Politics: The 
1977 Triumph and the Impact of the 
Vaddukoddai Resolution
Sampanthan's political journey officially 
began in 1977 when he contested and won the 
Trincomalee seat as a Tamil United Liberation 
Front (TULF) member. He garnered 15,144 
votes, which amounted to 51.76% of the votes, 
marking his entry into Parliament during a 
period of significant political upheaval in the 
country, particularly for Tamils.
The catalyst for this upheaval was the adoption 
of the Vaddukoddai Resolution on May 14, 
1976, in Pannakam near Vaddukoddai in 
Jaffna. This pivotal moment in the Tamil 
nationalist movement saw the TULF, under the 
leadership of S. J. V. Chelvanayakam and with 
key advocates like Appapillai Amirthalingam, 
call for the creation of an independent Tamil 
Eelam. 
The resolution signified a significant shift from 
earlier calls for federalism to advocating for 
a separate state for Tamils in the Northern</p>

and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. 
However, this resolution was not a 
genuine demand for independence. 
Instead, it was a politically strategic 
maneuver by the Tamil leaders of 
the time aimed at garnering votes, 
mobilizing Tamil youth for their 
cause, and sending a resolute message 
to the Sinhala government.
Despite the political machinations 
of the leaders, the resolution 
struck a deep chord within Tamil-
speaking communities, particularly 
galvanizing the youth. Among 
them was Veluppillai Prabhakaran, 
who had already commenced his 
militant activities by assassinating 
Alfred Duraiappah on July 27, 1975. 
The Vaddukoddai Resolution had 
a profound impact, drawing large 
numbers of Tamil youths to TULF 
meetings. In a dramatic display of 
commitment, these youths would 
slash their forearms and anoint the 
foreheads of TULF leaders with their 
blood, underscoring their fervent 
dedication to the cause.
One notable incident involved the 
future LTTE intelligence chief, 
"Pottu Amman," who earned 
his name by slashing his thumb 
and anointing TULF Member of 
Parliament Yogeswaran's forehead 
with his blood, like a bindi. Contrary 
to popular belief that his name 
stemmed from his involvement in 
violent activities, the moniker "Pottu 
Amman" directly originated from 
this symbolic act. In the LTTE's 
lexicon, the term "Pottu Vaithal" is 
often metaphorically equated with 
killing someone with a bullet to the 
forehead.
Ironically, in a cruel twist of fate, the LTTE, whose 
leaders were initially inspired by the TULF's 
Vaddukoddai Resolution to take up arms, later 
assassinated TULF Members of Parliament 
Yogeswaran and Amirthalingam 13 years later. 
The Vaddukoddai Resolution, which called for an 
independent Tamil Eelam, was a pivotal catalyst that 
inspired and compelled many Tamil youths to embrace 
militancy, setting the stage for a profound and tragic 
transformation in the Tamil struggle.
Following the adoption of the Vaddukoddai 
Resolution, the TULF ran in the 1977 Sri Lankan 
parliamentary elections, campaigning for an 
independent Tamil Eelam. Their platform resonated 
strongly in Tamil-majority regions, resulting in a 
significant victory where the TULF won 18 seats—10</p>

from Jaffna, 4 from Vanni, 1 from Trincomalee, 
2 from Batticaloa, and 1 from Ampara. The 
only seat they missed was Kalkudah in the 
Eastern Province, where K.W. Devanayagam of 
the UNP won and was subsequently appointed 
Minister of Justice.
The July 21, 1977, elections also marked a 
dramatic shift in Sri Lanka's national political 
landscape. The United National Party (UNP) 
secured a landslide victory with 140 of the 168 
seats, achieving an unprecedented majority, 
while the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party 
(SLFP) faced its worst defeat in history, falling 
from 91 seats to a mere eight. 
The TULF's 18 seats made it the main 
opposition in Parliament, a historic first for a 
minority party in Sri Lanka. TULF's general 
secretary, Appapillai Amirthalingam, was 
elected as the leader of the opposition, making 
history as the first Tamil to hold this position.
Decades later, Sampanthan became the second 
Tamil politician to assume the leader of the 
Opposition role after the 2015 parliamentary 
elections. This occurred when the two main 
Sinhala parties formed a coalition government, 
leaving the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) 
as the primary opposition; with just 16 seats, 
R. Sampanthan became the Opposition 
Leader, the first Tamil in 37 years to occupy 
the position, and the house allocated for the 
opposition leader.
Ironically, this house became a favorite target 
for critics who, despite Sampanthan's other 
obvious faults, chose to focus on this issue as a 
way of engaging in cheap politics—or, as some 
might say, in the classic way of Tamil politics.
In 1983, Sampanthan and all other TULF 
MPs boycotted Parliament due to multiple 
pressures. Sri Lankan Tamil militants strongly 
opposed the extension of their term beyond 
six years, and the introduction of the Sixth 
Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka 
added further complications. This Amendment 
mandated that all members of Parliament 
and public officers renounce support for a 
separate state and take an oath of allegiance 
to the unitary state of Sri Lanka. It explicitly 
prohibited any advocacy for the establishment 
of a separate state within Sri Lanka, making 
such actions a criminal offense.
The political climate was further strained by 
the 1982 Sri Lankan national referendum, 
held on December 22, 1982, which offered 
the public the option to extend the life of 
Parliament by six years. Called by President J. 
R. Jayawardene, who had recently been re-
elected. The referendum aimed to maintain the 
United National Party's (UNP) supermajority 
in Parliament. 
Opposition parties viewed this as a dictatorial 
move and campaigned against it. Despite their 
efforts, over 54 percent of votes cast were in 
favor of extending the life of Parliament.
However, LTTE and other militant 
organizations firmly warned Tamil MPs 
against extending their terms, implying 
that doing so would come with serious 
consequences. This blend of political and 
militant pressures ultimately led to the TULF's 
decision to boycott Parliament, after three 
months of absence, Sampanthan forfeited his 
seat on September 7, 1983.
Sealed in the Air: Sampanthan's 
Pivotal Role in the Indo-Lanka Accord
As a prominent member of the Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF), Rajavarothayam 
Sampanthan played a key role in the crucial 
discussions leading up to the signing of the 
historic Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987. Reflecting</p>

on this significant period, The Hindu's Meera 
Srinivasan reported an intriguing anecdote 
shared by Sampanthan.
Sampanthan recalled learning that President 
J.R. Jayawardene, notorious for his cunning 
and strategic maneuvering, had managed to 
convince Romesh Bhandari, the special envoy 
of then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, that 
there was no linguistic contiguity between Sri 
Lanka's north and east. This misinformation 
threatened the prospects of merging the 
two provinces, a critical issue for the Tamil 
community.
Determined to set the record straight, 
Sampanthan, along with TULF stalwarts A. 
Amirthalingam and M. Sivasithamparam, 
was in Madras (now Chennai) and sought 
an urgent meeting with Prime Minister 
Gandhi. The Prime Minister's Office informed 
them that Gandhi would be visiting Tiruchi 
(Tiruchirappalli) and suggested that the 
only way to secure a meeting would be to 
accompany him back to New Delhi on his 
chartered flight.
Seizing the opportunity, the TULF trio took 
an overnight train from Chennai to Tiruchi. 
They managed to secure a place on Gandhi's 
flight and, after takeoff, were escorted to the 
Prime Minister's suite. Armed with a map, 
Sampanthan demonstrated the linguistic 
contiguity between Sri Lanka's north and east, 
meticulously explaining the geographical and 
cultural connections.
As they prepared to disembark, Sampanthan, 
shaking hands and bidding farewell to the 
Indian Prime Minister, emphasized, "What I 
have told you is the absolute truth." His earnest 
plea and detailed presentation left a lasting 
impression on Gandhi.
Months later, the Indo-Lanka Accord was 
signed, prominently featuring the merger of 
the north and east provinces among its key 
provisions. Reflecting on this critical moment, 
Sampanthan later remarked, "The merger was 
sealed in the air," referring to that decisive 
flight where he and his colleagues successfully 
conveyed their message to Prime Minister 
Gandhi.
In the early 2000s, Rajavarothayam 
Sampanthan, whether out of fear of the 
LTTE or due to engaging in opportunistic 
politics, began to vehemently criticize the 
13th Amendment, a pivotal element of the 
Indo-Lanka Accord. This was an agreement 
Sampanthan had originally supported and 
worked hard to help establish. During this 
period, when the LTTE was at its peak, 
Sampanthan famously declared that "they 
wouldn't even touch the 13th Amendment 
with a broomstick.
However, following the annihilation of the 
LTTE in 2009, Sampanthan's stance shifted 
dramatically. Recognizing the Amendment's 
potential for devolving power and promoting 
reconciliation, he began to advocate for its 
implementation.
From Defeat to Tragedy: Sampanthan's 
1989 Campaign and Amirthalingam's 
Assassination
In the 1989 parliamentary election held 
on February 15, Sampanthan ran as one of 
the ENDLF/EPRLF/TELO/TULF alliance 
candidates in the Trincomalee District. 
Unfortunately, the coalition won no seats, and 
Sampanthan secured only 6,048 votes.</p>

Lankan Tamils. This event marked a significant 
turning point in the Tamil political landscape.
The LTTE cited various reasons for 
branding Amirthalingam a traitor, but the 
underlying motive was more straightforward. 
Prabhakaran, the LTTE supremo, recognized 
that as long as Amirthalingam was alive, 
the Sri Lankan Tamils would never wholly 
accept Prabhakaran as their sole leader. 
Amirthalingam's influence and stature 
threatened Prabhakaran's quest for undisputed 
leadership. By eliminating Amirthalingam, 
Prabhakaran sought to consolidate his control 
over the Tamil movement and assert his 
dominance as the singular voice for the Tamil 
people.
1994 Defeat and 1997 Redemption
Sampanthan ran again in the 1994 
parliamentary election but failed to get re-
elected, coming in second among TULF 
candidates. Arunachalam Thangathurai, a 
noble statesman who was well-liked by the 
rural public, polled the highest number of 
preferential votes in the August 1994 General 
Election, with Sampanthan coming second in 
the TULF's list for the Trincomalee district, 
securing 19,525 votes.
Sampanthan re-entered Parliament in 1997 
following the assassination of Arunachalam 
Thangathurai on July 5, 1997, which coincided 
with Black Tiger's Day. Thangathurai was 
killed along with six others, including three 
school principals, in a grenade attack and 
shooting by the LTTE while attending a 
function at Sri Shanmuga Hindu Ladies 
College in Trincomalee.
Sampanthan ran in the 2000 parliamentary 
election as one of TULF's candidates in 
Trincomalee District, but unfortunately, the 
TULF did not win any seats in the district.
Formation of the TNA: "Tiger 
Nominated Agents"
LTTE supremo Prabhakaran often remained 
politically naive. However, in the early 2000s,

thanks to some astute advisers, he recognized 
the need for a political arm to legitimize the 
LTTE's actions. This realization led to the 
formation of the Tamil National Alliance 
(TNA), humorously but revealingly dubbed by 
some as "Tiger Nominated Agents." 
This improbable coalition brought together 
a mix of moderate Tamil nationalist factions 
and former militant groups. The alliance 
comprised the Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF), All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), 
Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation 
Front (EPRLF), and Tamil Eelam Liberation 
Organization (TELO).
The formation of the TNA was a strategic 
move, bringing together these diverse groups 
under one banner and providing political 
cover for the LTTE's actions. Ironically, TELO 
and EPRLF members, who were previously 
branded as traitors and hunted down by the 
LTTE, joined forces with the very organization 
that had once killed them with impunity.

Leaders of these militant organizations, whose 
friends and comrades had been brutally 
killed by the LTTE, bowed to Prabhakaran's 
authority and were effectively "baptized" 
by the LTTE. It was akin to the mythical 
transformation of Ahalya, who was turned to 
stone and then revived by the touch of Lord 
Rama—these militant groups, once ostracized 
by LTTE, were resurrected by LTTE itself.
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was 
officially established in October 2001 to 
participate in the 2001 parliamentary elections 
on a unified platform. R. Sampanthan was 
appointed as the leader of the alliance by the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
However, due to the lack of recognition from 
the Election Commission, the TNA contested 
the 2001 elections under the Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF) banner.
In the 2001 parliamentary elections, the 
TNA, using the TULF name and its rising sun 
symbol, garnered 348,164 votes, representing 
3.89% of the total votes. This electoral effort 
resulted in the TNA securing 15 out of 225 
seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.
From Target to Mouthpiece
Upon his appointment as the leader of the 
TNA, R. Sampanthan showed little to no 
political shame, unabashedly becoming a 
mouthpiece for the LTTE. This was despite 
the LTTE having previously hunted down 
several leaders of his own party. Remarkably, 
Sampanthan himself had been on the LTTE's 
hit list just two years before the coalition was 
formed.
Following the brutal LTTE suicide attack that 
killed Neelan Tiruchelvam on July 29, 1999, 
credible sources within the LTTE informed 
the Jaffna Monitor that Sampanthan was also 
a target. These sources revealed that Pottu 
Amman, the head of the LTTE intelligence 
wing, had assigned the task of eliminating 
Sampanthan to Charles, who was then in 
charge of LTTE intelligence operations in 
Colombo.
On August 1, 1999, just two days after 
the assassination of Neelan Tiruchelvam, 
newspapers reported a significant security 
shift: "The Presidential Security Division (PSD) 
has been assigned to provide protection for 
the TULF General Secretary, R. Sampanthan. 
This decision replaces the Ministerial Security 
Division, which typically safeguards cabinet 
ministers and had been responsible for Dr. 
Neelan Tiruchelvam's security. The change 
follows considerable intelligence indicating a 
credible threat to Sampanthan's life from the 
LTTE."
However, this scenario changed after the 
formation of the Tamil National Alliance. 
Sampanthan, too, was 'baptized' by the LTTE 
supremo and became a patriot. In return, 
Sampanthan went beyond all boundaries 
to whitewash the LTTE and its supremo, 
Prabhakaran.

On October 28, 2001, newspapers reported: 
"The Tamil Parties' Alliance has been formed 
to muster the support of the Tamil people 
and their political forces for the freedom 
struggle of the Liberation Tigers in and out 
of Parliament. The time has now come for all 
the Tamil political forces in the northeast to 
unite under one banner to give full support 
to the LTTE who are involved in the freedom 
struggle," declared Sampanthan.
He elaborated, "Without the wholehearted 
participation of the Liberation Tigers, no firm 
and lasting political solution can be found 
for the Tamil national question. A political 
solution found in talks with the Liberation 
Tigers can only be implemented under the 
supervision of the international community. 
Therefore, the government should first 
declare a cease-fire and initiate talks with the 
Liberation Tigers without hesitation."
In a brazen display of deference to the LTTE, 
he further stated, "One of the main demands 
of the Tamil parties' alliance is that no talks 
should be held by the government with 
any other group when negotiating with the 
Liberation Tigers."
Revival of ITAK: The TNA's New 
Symbol and Political Journey
In 2001, due to unforeseen circumstances, 
the newly formed Tamil National Alliance 
(TNA) lost the right to use the Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF) symbol, the rising 
sun. This led to the revival of the long-inactive 
Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK).
The TNA secured fifteen seats in the December 
2001 parliamentary polls, including one 
national list MP. The TULF President at 
the time, Murugesu Sivasithamparam, was 
appointed to this national list seat. However, 
following Sivasithamparam's demise on June 
5, 2002, Veerasingham Anandasangaree, a 
maverick politician, became the President of 
the TULF.
Anandasangaree, true to his unyielding 
political style, was defiant towards 
Prabhakaran's authority. His attitude was 
essentially, "Who the hell is Prabhakaran to 
order me?" Predictably, he soon clashed with 
the LTTE Miraculously, and for reasons best 
known to Prabhakaran, the LTTE supremo did 
not order Anandasangaree's assassination, a 
stark contrast to his usual tactics. This decision 
left many of Prabhakaran's supporters deeply 
confused.
At that time, this writer was a school student 
and overheard discussions among die-hard 
LTTE supporters, questioning why our beloved 
"Thesiya Thalaivar" (national leader) had not 
yet ordered Anandasangaree's assassination. 
Prabhakaran was revered almost as a deity, and 
disobeying or insulting him was considered 
blasphemy. Despite this, Anandasangaree 
remained resolute and unafraid, exuding an "I 
don't care even if you kill me" attitude. He even 
wrote a few letters to Prabhakaran, saying,</p>

'jk;gp&gt; ePAk; mope;J jkpo; ,dj;ijAk; 
mopf;fhNj" (Brother, do not destroy yourself 
and the Tamil race), which turned out to be 
prophetic a few years later.
The LTTE ordered the TULF to remove 
Anandasangaree from office. Most of the 
TULF, out of fear of the LTTE, complied and 
removed Anandasangaree, prompting him to 
take the matter to court. Legal disputes over 
the rising sun symbol ensued, and the courts 
eventually ruled in favor of Anandasangaree, 
allowing him to retain the symbol.
Consequently, the TNA opted for the ITAK 
symbol, the house, and the previously dormant 
ITAK gained new life, becoming the principal 
component of the TNA.
2004 Parliamentary Elections: TNA's 
Unprecedented Victory Amid Electoral 
Malpractices
In the 2004 parliamentary elections, the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA) contested under the 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) symbol 
and achieved an unprecedented victory. They 
garnered 633,654 votes, accounting for 6.84% 
of the total vote, and secured 22 seats—the 
maximum number a Tamil party could win in 
the North and East. This triumph was largely 
attributed to the pervasive fear of the LTTE 
and evident electoral malpractices.
This writer witnessed widespread electoral 
malpractice in Jaffna. In one instance, a friend 
of his, who was only 17 and couldn't legally 
vote, managed to cast five votes on polling 
day, all as fake votes for the TNA. His first-
choice vote was for Selvarajah Kajendran, 
the then-president of the Jaffna University 
Student Union and now an MP and General 
Secretary of the Tamil National People's Front 
(TNPF). The atmosphere was such that polling 
agents and officers were verbally or indirectly 
instructed to just observe and not intervene. In 
some places, these officers even facilitated the 
malpractice.
Selvarajah Kajendran alone garnered 112,077 
votes in Jaffna district, an unprecedented figure 
in Jaffna's electoral history. This astonishing 
number was achieved through various 
malpractices. Many deceased individuals 
seemingly "reemerged" as their votes were 
cast, and numerous Tamils settled abroad also 
had their votes cast in this election despite not 
physically being present. 
The manipulation was so blatant that it turned 
the entire electoral process into a farce. While 
the TNA would have likely won the election 
even without these malpractices, the argument 
can be made that achieving 22 seats was 
significantly influenced by these fraudulent 
activities.
TNA's Changing Fortunes: From 
LTTE-backed Victory to Independent 
Struggle
After the election, Sampanthan was chosen 
as the leader of the TNA parliamentary 
group with the blessing of the Tigers. This 
appointment solidified his leadership of the 
alliance for the next two decades, even after 
the LTTE and its leadership were annihilated 
in Mullivaikkal in 2009. Sampanthan remained 
in his position until his death in 2024.
By the time the TNA contested the general 
election in April 2010, the LTTE was no longer 
a force, having been obliterated by the Sri 
Lankan army, a downfall hastened by their 
own strategic blunders. Without the Tigers 
to manipulate the electoral process and stuff 
ballot boxes, the TNA faced a stark reality. The 
party managed to secure only 14 seats, a sharp 
decline from their previous triumphs. The</p>

absence of the LTTE's heavy-handed influence 
laid bare the challenges of maintaining 
political dominance without the crutch of 
electoral malpractice.
Sampanthan and the LTTE: A 
Controversial Alliance
Sources close to Sampanthan told the Jaffna 
Monitor that Sampanthan was more pragmatic 
than a steadfast ideologue. They elaborated 
that while Sampanthan maintained his belief 
in nonviolent politics until the end and was 
not a fan of the LTTE's killing spree or its 
violent tactics, he always lamented the killings 
of TULF leaders Amirthalingam, Yogeswaran, 
Neelan Tiruchelvam, and many others by the 
LTTE. 
However, he never publicly criticized the 
LTTE regarding these actions. The slightest 
criticism came in an interview with an English 
newspaper (he conveniently avoided giving 
even the slightest criticism of the LTTE 
on Tamil platforms), where he stated, "The 
killings of Amirthalingam, Yogeswaran, and 
Tiruchelvam cannot ever be justified. They 
were wrong, and they should never have been 
killed. That was my view then, and that is my 
view today. That will always be my view. There 
is no question about it."
Despite his personal views, Sampanthan 
accepted and recognized the LTTE as the 
sole representative of the Tamil people. Some 
might call this political opportunism, while 
others might see it as a political roller coaster. 
He even admitted in Parliament that their 
electoral victory was largely due to the support 
of the Tigers and officially recognized the 
LTTE as the sole voice of the Tamil populace.
Like Prabhakaran, Sampanthan showed little 
concern for the involvement of TNA members 
in the peace process. He believed that in 
discussions about a political solution for the 
Tamil people, the Tigers alone could represent 
the Tamil community. This stance mirrored 
the LTTE's perspective, effectively sidelining 
other Tamil political entities and reinforcing 
the LTTE's role as the sole representative of the 
Tamil people in negotiations. 
Silence in the Face of Atrocity: 
Sampanthan's Complicity with the LTTE.
Under Sampanthan's leadership, the TNA 
remained committed to the LTTE's brutal 
strategies until the very end. Having granted 
the LTTE the unprecedented status of the sole 
representative of the Tamil-speaking people—
albeit by force—the TNA and Sampanthan 
remained silent as the LTTE dragged lakhs of 
innocent people with them to Mullivaikal.
The LTTE's tactics became increasingly 
desperate and ruthless. As the Sri Lankan 
military closed in, the LTTE forcibly 
conscripted civilians, including children as 
young as ten, to fight on the frontlines. The 
TNA and Sampanthan did not speak out 
against these heinous actions. They never 
publicly asked the LTTE to release the civilians 
and allow them to escape the war zone, nor did 
they demand that the LTTE fight with dignity 
without using their own people as human 
shields. Despite the harrowing reports and 
pleas, the TNA and Sampanthan maintained a 
troubling silence.
A considerable number of conscientious 
Tamils later told the Jaffna Monitor that 
they had contacted, begged, and pleaded 
with Sampanthan to denounce the LTTE's 
brutal strategy of using civilians as human 
shields. These individuals implored him to put 
pressure on the LTTE to release the civilians. 
However, whether out of fear, political 
expediency, or other reasons, he and the TNA</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
25
remained numb and indifferent to the plight of 
the Tamil people.
On moral grounds, the TNA and Sampanthan 
can never disassociate themselves from the 
LTTE's murderous actions against their own 
people. Sampanthan knew exactly what he 
was doing. He fully realized that the LTTE 
was dragging the Tamil community into a 
destructive war, yet he chose to remain a mute 
spectator, complicit in their reprehensible 
strategy. This inaction not only tarnished his 
legacy but also left an indelible stain on his 
leadership, a silent betrayal of the very people 
he was supposed to protect. The weight of 
this moral failing cast a long shadow over his 
contributions.
Sampanthan's Gamble: Aligning with 
Fonseka Against the Rajapaksas
Just eight months after the Mullivaikkal 
tragedy and the complete destruction of the 
LTTE, the Rajapaksa brothers celebrated a 
victorious presidential election. In a politically 
audacious and courageous move, Sampanthan 
chose to support Sarath Fonseka, the former 
army commander of the Rajapaksa regime.
Insiders close to Sampanthan revealed that he 
was acutely aware of the potential backlash and 
the risk of being labeled a traitor by some Sri 
Lankan Tamils for this decision. Fonseka, after 
all, was the military leader who had executed 
the final war.
Sources close to Sampanthan revealed that he 
believed supporting the opposition candidate 
standing against the formidable Rajapaksa 
brothers was not just a political and diplomatic 
maneuver but also a reflection of the collective 
sentiment of the Tamil people. They further 
explained that Sampanthan was fully aware 
of the near impossibility of defeating the 
Rajapaksas at the height of their power. He also 
Sampanthan waving the Sri Lankan lion flag, a gesture that sparked significant discussion among Tamil nationalists and the 
diaspora Tiger proxies</p>

26
received no assurances from Sarath Fonseka 
on Tamil rights and struggled to articulate how 
Fonseka would be better for Tamil interests 
than Rajapaksa. Nevertheless, he made the 
decision, even though supporting a ruthless 
army commander made him unfavorable to a 
section of Tamils and weakened the diaspora 
Tamils' attempts to brand the Sri Lankan army 
as genocidal. By supporting the chief who ran 
the entire military operations, Sampanthan, in 
a way, gave implicit recognition to the Army.
2015 Election and Becoming a 
Kingmaker
Sampanthan became a kingmaker in the 
2015 presidential election. Sources close to 
Sampanthan told the Jaffna Monitor that by 
supporting a candidate against Rajapaksa in 
the 2010 presidential election, Sampanthan 
laid the groundwork for the Rajapaksas' 
eventual defeat in 2015. They elaborated that, 
in the context of Buddhist-Sinhala supremacy, 
the victory at Mullivaikkal was their greatest 
and most challenging achievement, and 
Mahinda Rajapaksa was the torchbearer of 
Buddhist-Sinhala supremacy. Most of the 
Sinhala population did not consider him a 
president but a king. Yet, few anticipated, 
including Sampanthan, that the victors of 
Mullivaikkal, the torchbearer of Sinhala 
supremacy and the 'never crowned' king of the 
Sinhala people, could be overthrown within six 
years.
They argued that this shift did not stem 
from a single election but was a result of 
Sampanthan's strategic stand in 2010. By 
uniting the Tamil people and demonstrating to 
the international community and southern Sri 
Lanka that the Tamils were willing to go to any 
lengths to defeat Rajapaksa, Sampanthan set 
the stage for the political shift that culminated 
in 2015, they told the Jaffna Monitor.
Sources close to Sampanthan posited that his 
decision inspired the Sri Lankan opposition 
to unite and present a single candidate in the 
2015 election. According to them, Sampanthan 
was instrumental in conveying to diplomatic 
circles and southern Sri Lanka that a direct 
contest between Ranil Wickramasinghe 
and the Rajapaksas would only guarantee 
another victory for the latter. Consequently, 
Maithripala Sirisena, a cabinet minister 
who was in the inner circle of Mahinda 
Rajapaksa even the previous night of him 
filing nomination, emerged as the consensus 
candidate for the opposition in the 2015 
presidential election. The Tamil electorate's 
support was pivotal in securing this victory. 
Following his defeat, Mahinda Rajapaksa 
famously lamented to his wailing supporters 
in his hometown, "You did not defeat me. The 
Tamils defeated me."
Eight months after the groundbreaking 
presidential election in which TNA-backed 
Maithripala Sirisena surprised many, 
particularly the Rajapaksa clan, by becoming 
the seventh President of Sri Lanka, a 
significant parliamentary election took place. 
The election led to an unexpected political 
shift when the two main Sinhala parties 
formed a coalition government. This coalition 
left the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) as the 
primary opposition party with just 16 seats. 
Consequently, R. Sampanthan became the 
leader of the opposition, marking him as the 
second Tamil politician to hold this position 
since Amirthalingam. 
A Quest for Peace: Sampanthan's 
Efforts and Disappointments Post-LTTE
After the end of the LTTE's armed struggle, 
which marked the conclusion of the Tamil's 
armed struggle, as the LTTE had annihilated</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
27
other militant organizations, taken charge 
as the sole agent of the Tamil struggle, and 
eventually led countless people to their deaths 
at Mullivaikkal, Sampanthan redirected his 
efforts toward finding a peaceful solution to Sri 
Lanka's enduring ethnic conflict.
Sources close to Sampanthan disclosed that 
he steadfastly believed he could resolve 
this seemingly intractable issue within his 
lifetime. These insiders also highlighted that 
Sampanthan was convinced that any lasting 
resolution required the consent of the Sinhala 
people, who form the vast majority in Sri 
Lanka.
To this end, Sampanthan pondered ways 
to embrace the Sinhala people and their 
political parties, with the aim of dispelling the 
hostility, fears, and prejudices they harbored. 
He believed the LTTE's armed struggle had 
entrenched a deep-seated enmity among the 
Sinhala population. 
Consequently, Sampanthan adopted a 
political approach that sought to avoid further 
alienating the Sinhala community. He was 
resolute in his determination to find a solution 
acceptable to the Sinhala people and steered 
his party toward this goal.
Sources close to him revealed that this 
determination drove Sampanthan to first 
oust the often troublesome Gajendrakumar 
Ponnambalam's faction from the TNA, 
which he considered a self-styled pseudo-
Tamil nationalist. Following this, he targeted 
Suresh Premachandran of the Eelam People's 
Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF). 
Premachandran had a notorious past as a 
mass murderer during the time of the Indian 
Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) intervention. He 
was later baptized by the LTTE and rebranded 
himself as a Tamil nationalist leader.
These sources elaborated that Sampanthan's 
aim was to transform the TNA into a moderate 
political entity, shedding its image of Tamil 
extremism. He believed that portraying 
the TNA as a party open to peaceful 
and democratic solutions would garner 
broader support from both the Sinhala and 
international communities. According to 
people close to him, Sampanthan believed this 
approach would help find a peaceful solution 
for Tamils within a united Sri Lanka. To 
achieve this vision, he brought in figures like 
Sumanthiran and C.V. Vigneswaran, whom 
he perceived as moderates capable of steering 
the party toward a more centrist and inclusive 
stance. However, they later betrayed him, 
which is a different story altogether.
Sampanthan and his TNA played a pivotal 
role in the regime change that occurred in 
2015. As a result of that regime change, the 
Ranil-Maithri government accepted the UN's 
Resolution 30/1. In 2015, the Government of 
Sri Lanka co-sponsored this landmark UN 
Human Rights Council resolution, making 
commitments to promote reconciliation, 
accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka. 
The resolution called for the establishment of 
a judicial mechanism with a special counsel 
to investigate allegations of human rights 
violations and international humanitarian law 
abuses. It also emphasized the importance of 
including Commonwealth and other foreign 
judges, defense lawyers, and authorized 
prosecutors and investigators in this process.
The resolution mandated structural changes 
to resolve the ethnic problem and initiated 
arrangements to draft a new constitution. 
Sampanthan, believing the Sinhala politicians 
and their promises, fully cooperated. 
Sampanthan meticulously traced the 
constitutional evolution of Sri Lanka, 
highlighting the pivotal moments that shaped 
the nation's political landscape. He examined 
the 1947 Soulbury Constitution, crafted by</p>

the British Colonial government, the first 
Republican Constitution of 1972, framed by 
the Sri Lanka Freedom Party-led government, 
and the second Republic Constitution of 1978, 
drafted by the United National Party. In each 
instance, he identified a critical shortfall: the 
absence of national consensus.
"The ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka, which 
has persisted since Independence in 1947 
and escalated into an armed struggle lasting 
25-30 years, can be attributed to the lack of a 
Constitution founded on the broadest possible 
national consensus, tailored to meet the 
needs of our diverse and pluralistic society," 
Sampanthan asserted. He emphasized that 
all previous constitutions had been created 
without the contribution of the Tamil people.
Sources close to Sampanthan told the 
Jaffna Monitor that he harbored a profound 
aspiration: to create a new constitution 
with the active participation of the 
Tamil community. He believed that only 
through such inclusive and comprehensive 
constitutional reform could Sri Lanka achieve 
lasting peace and unity.
Sampanthan went to great lengths to support 
the Maithri-Ranil government, sometimes</p>

acting as its spokesperson. The efforts to draft 
a constitution progressed to an interim report. 
When this interim report was submitted and 
debated in Parliament, Sampanthan declared 
the new constitution as a solution to the ethnic 
problem and gave promises to the Tamil 
masses.
Sampanthan, who initially entered electoral 
politics when the Tamil United Liberation 
Front (TULF) campaigned on the promise of 
Tamil Eelam, later came to despise the term. 
During a heated parliamentary session, when 
Mahinda Rajapaksa's party was inciting anti-
Tamil sentiment by alleging that the Tamils 
were seeking to divide Sri Lanka, Sampanthan 
delivered a powerful rebuttal. He stated, "I 
would like to put this on record because I want 
everyone in this country to know that it was 
malicious, vicious, fallacious, false propaganda 
on the part of President Rajapaksa and the 
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). If you 
proceed with this agenda, I want to tell you 
that [Tamil] Eelam will bloom, not on account 
of us, but on account of your Lotus Bud. Your 
Lotus Bud [the SLPP's symbol] will bloom into 
an Eelam. That is what will happen. Therefore, 
please resist your temptation to achieve 
cheap political gain by carrying on such false 
propaganda."
In 2018, Maithripala Sirisena, the then 
"unfit president," one of the initiators of the 
constitution-drafting efforts, betrayed the 
process. Sampanthan's dream was shattered. 
Sources close to Sampanthan told the Jaffna 
Monitor that he was deeply saddened and 
felt betrayed. All the promises he made to the 
Tamil people turned out to be false. Not only 
was his belief defeated, but as a result, the 
TNA also lost its long-held dominance. In the 
next election, the party's votes scattered, going 
from 16 seats to 10 seats, and its overall vote 
percentage dropped from 4.62% to 2.82%.
Sampanthan's Political Decline: The 
TNA's Fragmented Legacy
Under Sampanthan's leadership, the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA) has become 
increasingly fragmented. The chief constituent 
party, Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), 
stands on one side, while the other two 
constituent parties, the Tamil Eelam 
Liberation Organization (TELO) and the 
People's Liberation Organization of Tamil 
Eelam (PLOTE), align on the opposite 
side. This division is attributed to the 
politics of Sampanthan's political heir, M.A. 
Sumanthiran, and Sampanthan's perceived 
ineffectiveness in maintaining unity within the 
alliance.
Of the ten seats held by the TNA in 
Parliament, six belong to the ITAK, three to 
TELO, and one to PLOTE. The alliance has 
now effectively been reduced to only the ITAK, 
making the TNA synonymous with ITAK. 
Under Sampanthan's leadership, the TNA's 
political clout has dramatically diminished. 
From a staggering twenty-two seats—the 
maximum number of seats a Tamil party can 
win from the North and East—the TNA has 
been reduced to a mere six seats. 
Currently, even the ITAK is embroiled in 
internal turmoil, splitting into two factions: 
the Sumanthiran faction and the Shritharan 
faction, both engaged in a fierce legal battle. 
When his beloved ITAK was dragged into 
court, Sampanthan was powerless to intervene.
In a family, when conflicts arise, the elders 
step in to resolve them. It is the same within 
a party—respected senior leaders resolve 
disputes. But as a senior leader, Sampanthan's 
word was not heeded by anyone. His once 
authoritative voice was ignored by everyone, 
including Sumanthiran, the very person he</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

had brought into the political arena.
Adding insult to injury, Sampanthan's 
influence had diminished so drastically that 
he had to lodge a formal complaint about 
appointments being made in his own electoral 
constituency without his knowledge.
The Decline of Sampanthan's 
Leadership
One could argue that a leader's true legacy 
is defined by their protégés, how they keep 
their party united during their tenure, and 
how they fulfill the promises made to the 
people they represent. Unfortunately, neither 
Sumanthiran nor C.V. Vigneswaran—
whom Sampanthan had elevated to political 
prominence—managed to uphold his vision. 
C.V. Vigneswaran distanced himself from 
Sampanthan, openly criticizing his approach, 
while Sumanthiran, once considered 
Sampanthan's crown prince, publicly 
humiliated the veteran leader.
In his final days, Sampanthan became a 
leader who was disrespected by everyone, 
including his own protégés. He silently had 
to witness the disintegration of his alliance 
and the fragmentation of his party. Moreover, 
Sampanthan failed to fulfill the promises 
regarding Tamil rights made to the Sri Lankan 
Tamils during the Yahapalana government, in 
which he, being the opposition leader, often 
acted as the government's spokesperson. The 
high hopes for political reform and greater 
autonomy for Tamils were left unfulfilled, 
leading to widespread disillusionment within 
the Tamil community.
One may argue, How could he hope to unify a 
diverse and divided nation when he couldn't 
maintain unity within his own party?</p>
