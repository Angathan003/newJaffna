T
he Tamil People's Assembly is throwing 
a grand party after finally convincing 
former MP P. Ariyanethiran to step up as their 
Tamil Common Candidate for the Presidential 
Election-probably because no one else was 
eager to take on the role! After what felt like 
endless hotel debates across the North and 
East, they've dubbed him the chosen one, 
celebrating as if they've just unlocked the 
secret to winning Tamil Eelam!
Pakkiyaselvam Ariyanethiran from 
Ambilanthurai, Paduvankarai, in Batticaloa, 
has become social media's latest meme 
sensation. As one witty political observer 
quipped, back in the LTTE days, it was always 
the Eastern fighters who got the short end of 
the stick-sent North to fight someone else's 
battles. Fast forward to today, and it seems 
Ariyanethiran is reprising that role, except 
now he's the East's official 'scapegoat' for a few 
Northerners' grand ambitions!
But here's the twist-a political observer wrote 
that his family used to be die-hard supporters 
of the United National Party! Back in the day, 
especially during Thanthai Chelva's (S. J. V. 
Chelvanayakam) time, they'd say that leaning 
toward Tamil nationalist politics-particularly 
anything tied to the North-was a surefire way 
to invite bad luck. Now, irony's having a field 
day as someone from that very family is being 
paraded around as the new champion of Tamil 
nationalism! Talk about a plot twist!
Former EROS Member of the Parliament and 
writer Alagu Gunaseelan didn't hold back in 
his spicy piece for Arangam News, an East-
based website known for embracing different 
voices and opinions. He pointed out that 
Ariyanethiran, born in 1955, was completely 
clueless about Tamil nationalist politics until 
1985. His sudden interest in the cause only 
sparked during Kumarappa's era, the then 
LTTE chief of Batticaloa and Ampara districts, 
and it wasn't exactly out of passion-it was more

about protecting his family's property and 
wealth. The plot thickened when Kumarappa 
fell for one of Ariyanethiran's relatives, 
cementing their alliance.
Gunaseelan further revealed that 
Ariyanethiran's rise to fame continued 
under Karuna Amman, the then-powerful 
military chief of the LTTE, thanks to his 
cosy connections with locals and relatives 
from Paduvankarai, like David, Thambirasa, 
Thayamoorthy, Thurai, and Kausalyan. 
Gunaseelan didn't stop there, pointing out 
that Ariyanethiran practically swiped a media 
outlet in Batticaloa to reinvent himself as a 
journalist, serving the Tamil press during 
Karuna's reign. According to Gunaseelan, 
whether it's media or politics, Ariyanethiran 
has mastered the art of "unethical behaviour." 
And as he cheekily put it, "birds of a feather 
flock together," with several Northern writers 
now jumping on the bandwagon to back him 
up without hesitation!
Ariyanethiran, who proudly thumps his 
chest, claiming he was brought into politics 
by LTTE supremo Prabhakaran, might want 
to add a little footnote explaining how that 
actually happened. After the LTTE formed 
the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), he ran in 
the 2004 parliamentary elections on the TNA 
ticket in Batticaloa District. But, in a dramatic</p>

twist, the all-powerful LTTE split in two, with 
the Eastern fighters led by Karuna Amman 
breaking away.
In that election, Ariyanethiran-known for his 
unwavering support of the Northern Tigers - 
ranked fifth in the TNA based on preferential 
votes, where only the top four were elected, 
leaving him without a seat. One political 
observer noted that his blind allegiance to the 
Northern Tigers was a significant reason for 
his failure to secure a position.
The lucky ones who did get elected were 
Thambappillai Kanagasabai, Thangeswary 
Kathiraman, Senathirajah Jeyanandamoorth 
and Kingsley Rasanayagam. But here's where 
it gets even juicier: the Tigers, who were not so 
thrilled with Kingsley Rasanayagam's closeness 
to Karuna Amman, kidnapped him and 
pressured him into resigning his MP position. 
And who swoops in through the Tigers' 
backdoor? None other than Ariyanethiran 
sneaked his way into Parliament with the same 
finesse he used to become a journalist-showing 
neither political decency nor integrity!
The 2004 parliamentary election took 
place on April 2, and by May, Kingsley 
Rasanayagam had resigned, clearing the 
path for Ariyanethiran, who eagerly took his 
oath in Parliament on May 18. But here's the 
real twist-Ariyanethiran won't soon forget 
that oath date, especially considering the 
eerie coincidence that exactly five years later, 
on May 18, 2009, the LTTE military was 
defeated at Mullivaikkal on the very same day. 
Coincidence? An Eastern writer couldn't help 
but wonder aloud.
Adding to the intrigue, even after resigning 
from his position as a Member of Parliament, 
Kingsley Rasanayagam was not spared by 
the LTTE; he was assassinated by the Tigers 
on October 19, 2004. Numerous hush-hush 
rumours are suggesting that Ariyanethiran 
may have had a hand in the assassination-
not directly, of course. What's even more 
curious is that, to this day, Ariyanethiran has 
never spoken out against the killing of the 
man whose seat he unethically slipped into in 
Parliament.
The Tamil Common Candidate saga 
is unfolding with all the gravitas of a 
Shakespearean drama-yet, as one political 
observer noted, it's hard not to see it as 
more of a farce than a tragedy. An MoU was 
signed with great fanfare by seven political 
heavyweights-each representing their</p>

respective parties-Selvam Adaikalanathan 
(TELO), C.V. Wigneswaran (Tamil People's 
Alliance), D. Siddarthan (PLOTE), N. 
Srikantha (Tamil Nationalist Party), Suresh 
Premachandran (EPRLF), P. Iyngaranesan 
(Tamil Nationalist Green Movement), and 
S. Venthan (Democratic Cadres Party). But 
here's where the plot takes a comedic turn-
these seasoned politicians, with decades of 
experience in councils and Parliament (with 
the exception of the Democratic Cadres Party), 
have somehow found themselves sharing the 
stage with just seven individuals-civil society 
activists T. Vasantharajah, S.C. Jothilingam, 
Prof. K.T. Kanesalingam, Selwyn Irenaeus, and 
R. Wigneswaran, along with political analysts 
A. Jatheendra and M. Nilanthan-a motley crew 
dubbed the 'Tamil People's Assembly.
A political observer, in conversation with 
Jaffna Monitor, questioned the absurdity of 
these political parties signing an MoU with 
mere individuals. Is this making a mockery 
of democracy? Another political observer, in 
conversation with Jaffna Monitor, noted that 
it's almost as if the political veterans, who have 
spent decades navigating the choppy waters 
of Tamil politics, have suddenly agreed to a 
script where they're on equal footing with 
these seven individuals. The so-called Tamil 
People's Assembly, now being paraded as a 
grand civil body, is little more than a small 
ensemble tasked with 'managing' the very 
politicians who have been in the trenches of 
both armed struggle and democratic battles. 
As another political commentator quipped, 
this arrangement doesn't just blur the lines 
of democracy-it turns the whole play into a 
caricature.
Another observer pointed out that the Tamil 
People's Assembly is being hyped as a majestic 
civil body when, in reality, the majority of civil 
societies from the North and East were not 
included.
Let's dive into the swirling questions around 
these civil organization representatives-
especially those individuals who've somehow 
been elevated to the same status as political 
parties. How ready are these seven politically 
motivated folks, who've been plucked from 
their day jobs in government service, teaching, 
and whatever else they do, to fully commit 
to public life? Are they really prepared to 
shoulder the same level of responsibility as the 
seasoned political party reps who signed this 
agreement?
And speaking of responsibility, where's the 
gender equality they've been preaching? 
These civil organizations have been so vocal 
about women's representation in politics, yet 
somehow didn't think to include even one 
female representative in this supposedly all-
inclusive framework. Even after students from 
Jaffna and Southeastern universities and the 
Association of Relatives of the Disappeared 
threw their support behind the common 
candidate, they weren't given representative 
status. What's up with that?
And now, let's talk geography. Among the 
seven civil representatives, three hail from 
Trincomalee, Ampara, and Batticaloa, while 
the other four are from Jaffna. So, why aren't 
districts like Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar, 
and Kilinochchi-areas that have seen war and 
cultural erasure and hold deep emotional 
significance-getting any representation? Are 
there really no civil representatives from 
Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi 
in the Tamil People's Assembly? Or, if there 
are, do they just not have enough clout to 
make it into this common framework? It 
makes you wonder, doesn't it?
It's almost comical that out of the fourteen 
stakeholders in this so-called 'Tamil Common 
Framework,' not a single one was willing 
to step up as the common candidate," a</p>

political observer noted. Instead, they pushed 
Ariyanethiran-an Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK) central committee member-
into the spotlight as the common Tamil 
candidate. What's particularly telling is that 
none of the seven civil representatives dared 
to volunteer-probably sensing the potential 
fallout. And even if someone had mustered 
the courage to run, the others would likely 
have shot them down. So, what did these 
individuals and the parties behind this farce 
do? They returned and picked a candidate 
from Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), the 
party they've criticized in the most colourful, 
unparliamentary terms.
And to add insult to injury, the political parties 
supporting this joke didn't even give him a 
symbol to run under. The Tamil common 
candidate is standing in the election as an 
independent. Parties like Tamil People's 
Alliance, TELO, PLOTE, and EPRLF aren't 
about to risk their symbols on this experiment. 
Even the Democratic Tamil National Alliance 
hesitated to offer their 'Kuthuvilakku' (oil 
lamp) symbol, fearing it might come back 
to haunt them in future elections if things 
go south. Ultimately, the common candidate 
had to settle for the 'Sangu' (conch) symbol, 
assigned by the election commission as an 
independent. It's like they're saying, 'Good 
luck, you're on your own!'
Credible sources told Jaffna Monitor that 
the Tamil Common Framework scoured the 
world, searching high and low for the perfect 
common candidate-someone who shouldn't 
belong to any party, should be from the East, 
should be a woman, and should gracefully 
exit politics after the election. But after all that 
effort, they were left with just two options: 
Ariyanethiran or K.V. Thavarasa-both full-
time politicians and both central committee 
members of the same ITAK, the party they've 
been criticizing for ages. And who did they 
pick? Ariyanethiran-a full-time politician who 
checks none of those boxes, except for being 
from the East. Talk about missing the mark!
Adding to the comedy, there's a huge 
disconnect between the framework's 
representatives and Ariyanethiran. The</p>

framework insists the candidate shouldn't 
re-enter politics after the election, but 
Ariyanethiran clearly missed the memo. He 
said he's just a 'symbol' until September 22 and 
won't be responsible for anything after that-
basically, leaving the framework to clean up 
the mess, he indirectly hinted.
They claimed that by fielding a common Tamil 
candidate, they were demonstrating that the 
Tamils had united as a nation. But if that 
were the case, how should the announcement 
have been made? Instead of a grand reveal 
before a massive crowd from the Northern 
and Eastern provinces, it ended up being a 
low-key press conference at Thanthai Selva 
Hallâ€”with hardly anyone in attendance. And 
guess who didn't show up? The leaders of the 
Tamil People's Alliance, TELO, and PLOTE. 
Their excuse? A parliamentary session. Some 
didn't even bother to send representatives. 
And let's be honest, even if they had planned a 
grand function, who would have attended? So, 
they safely confined themselves to a small hall, 
avoiding the embarrassment of empty seats. 
The announcement itself was a failure, and if 
this is what they call unity, it's off to a shaky 
start.
They also claimed they were sending a strong 
message to the international community 
that Tamils are standing together. But did 
the framework even consider discussing 
their grand plan with the local diplomatic 
community-the very first step in sending a 
strong message to the international stage? Did 
they at least check in with India, the country 
they often claim has a moral obligation to solve 
the Tamil issue? The answer, of course, is a 
resounding no.
These political leaders and civil society leaders 
seem to overlook that if this is being presented 
as the referendum of the Tamil people, yet 
in reality, many Tamils remain indifferent 
to this so-called common Tamil candidate, 
the candidate is likely to face a significant 
defeat. In that context, wouldn't it appear to 
the international community that the Tamil 
referendum has failed? Could this ultimately 
harm the Tamil cause? This situation is also 
raising concerns among ordinary Tamils: 
is this part of a broader agenda aimed at 
weakening the Tamil voice?
Lastly, Ariyanethiran, who's quick to 
criticize the presidential candidates-Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake, and Sarath Fonseka-for 
cheating the Tamils since 2009, might need 
a little history lesson. He should remember 
that his party backed Sarath Fonseka in the 
2010 Sri Lankan presidential election. In the 
2015 presidential election, they threw their 
support behind Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, becoming unofficial partners 
of the then 'Good Governance' alliance, with 
Sampanthan becoming the opposition leader 
with the blessings of Sinhala parties. Let's 
not forget how his party and his former boss, 
Sampanthan, were all smiles with Ranil during 
their 2015 political honeymoon. When Ranil's 
deputy, Sajith Premadasa, broke away from 
Ranil and ran in the 2019 presidential election, 
the TNA threw its support behind him 
unconditionally-despite Sajith promising in 
front of these TNA leaders to build a thousand 
viharas in the Tamil-speaking North and East.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's party, the JVP, 
went to court and orchestrated the split of the 
North and East. Yet, Anura was still handed 
the opposition whip post, courtesy of the 
TNA's support-where ITAK, the very party in 
which Ariyanethiran is a central committee 
member, is the chief constituent. If that's not 
Ariyanethiran's selective memory at work, 
then what is?</p>
