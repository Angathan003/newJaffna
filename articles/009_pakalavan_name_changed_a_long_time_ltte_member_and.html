Pakalavan (name changed), a 
long-time LTTE member and 
once a feared child abductor for 
the LTTE, recounts his harrowing 
past in an exclusive interview with 
the Jaffna Monitor. Following 
the tumultuous conclusion of Sri 
Lanka's brutal civil war, Pakalavan 
underwent a rehabilitation process 
and now resides abroad, wrestling 
daily with his remorse. He shares 
his story publicly for the first 
time, driven by a profound hope: 
to ensure that the atrocities he 
once committed are never echoed 
in Sri Lankan Tamil history. This 
interview coincides with the 15th 
anniversary of May 18, 2009, the 
day that marked the definitive end 
of the LTTE and the extinguishing 
of its leadership.</p>
<p>Which division were you part of in the 
LTTE?
I was in the Policy Development Division 
(nfhs;if Kd;ndLg;G gpupT), which is 
under the Political wing of the LTTE.
Who was your boss in this division?
Initially, my boss was Ramesh Anna, 
also known as Ilanko. He led the Policy 
Development Division. After S.P. Tamilselvan- 
the then head of the LTTE's political wing 
death, Nadesan, the police chief of the LTTE, 
took over the Political Division, and Ramesh

Anna became the head of LTTE police. 
Subsequently, Elilan- then the Trincomalee 
political head of the LTTE became the chief of 
the Policy Development Division.
What activities was the Policy 
Development Division involved in?
Before it became associated with forced 
conscription and the abduction of children, 
our division focused on performing street 
dramas. We operated a bookstore called 
Arivamuthu BookShop, where we sold books 
on various topics. We also owned a mini Tata 
bus that ran between Mallavi and Kilinochchi; 
the revenue generated was used to fund our 
activities. Additionally, we had a music troop.
However, in 2006, the LTTE leadership 
mandated that every family must contribute 
one child to the struggle. Consequently, our 
division began visiting households, targeting 
those without combatant members, to 
persuade them to provide a child for the cause. 
Initially, our unit alone was tasked with 
enlistment duties, but after a few weeks, all 
units within the political department were 
mandated to participate. At that time, our 
operations were based near the Nanthavanam 
base, which was under the supervision of the 
LTTE's international coordinator, Castro, 
located near the current Kilinochchi Stadium. 
Individuals enlisted by our unit were taken to 
this base for further processing.
Within our main base, a large whiteboard 
prominently displayed the enlistment 
performance of each unit within the political 
department. For example, enlistment 
numbers such as Nitharsanam (NTT) with 
5, the Judiciary Department with 4, the 
Kilinochchi Political Wing with 3, Voice of 
Tigers with 4, and Eelanatham with 2 were 
all noted. At the top of this list, the name 
of the Policy Development Division was 
consistently highlighted. This setup fostered a 
competitive environment among the divisions, 
each striving to outperform the others in 
recruitment numbers.
How did the listing of enlistment 
numbers impact enlistment outcome?
The displaying of enlistment figures was a 
strategic decision by the LTTE leadership, 
designed to cultivate a competitive 
environment among the units within the 
political department. This approach effectively 
motivated each unit to strive to surpass the 
others in terms of enlistment figures. Over 
time, this competitive dynamic led to a 
significant shift in tactics. Driven by the desire 
to increase their figures, all units within the 
political department eventually engaged in 
brutal forced enlistment activities. 
When did the competition among the 
units in the LTTE's political department 
start?
The competition started after August 2006.

Were recruitment methods consistent 
across all LTTE units...?
There were no standing orders or designated 
areas for recruitment, which meant that the 
methods of enlistment could vary widely, 
influenced by the behaviours of individuals 
and the practices of each unit.
Some LTTE supporters still claim that 
parents willingly sent their children to 
war?
No one can willingly send their child to 
warâ€”such a notion is typically found only 
in literature, not in real life. I can confidently 
say that, to my knowledge, not a single 
parent voluntarily allowed their children 
to be enlisted during the last war period. 
When mandatory enlistment started, parents 
sought ways to protect their children from 
conscription. Many families used sea and land 
routes to reach areas controlled by the army.
Which route was considered safe...?
Sea route. 
Why was the sea route considered 
safer than the land route?
Because, on land, one had to pass through two 
Forward Defense Lines (FDLs)â€”those of the 
LTTE and the army, which involved significant 
risk. In contrast, the sea route had much fewer 
restrictions and less likelihood of encountering 
armed checkpoints, making it a preferable 
option for escape.
What other methods did the general 
public employ to prevent their 
offspring from being enlisted?
Another strategy used by the general public 
to avoid enlistment involved marrying their 
offspring into families with LTTE members. 
Initially, the LTTE's policy was to recruit only 
one child from each family. Thus, if one sibling 
was already enlisted in the LTTE, the others 
were exempted. 
Families whose children were not yet in 
the LTTE often quickly arranged marriages 
with LTTE members to secure exemptions. 
This tactic provided a measure of safety and 
protection from forced recruitment. I know a 
landlord who married off his daughterâ€”whom 
our team was about to enlistâ€”to a famous 
LTTE leader's brother, providing hundreds 
of acres of land and a substantial dowry in 
money. They now live abroad.
There were instances of corruption involving 
enlistment exemptions among affluent 
families and individuals. For example, to 
my knowledge, a prominent businessman in 
Kilinochchi managed to secure an intelligence 
wing tag for his son from the intelligence unit. 
This tag ensured that he could not be recruited 
by other divisions like ours. However, as far 
as I know, he was merely sitting in his shop 
and conducting business. When our team 
approached him for enlistment, he showed us 
the tag and claimed that he was working for 
the intelligence wing.<br />
Another strategy employed by those with 
connections within the LTTE involved placing 
their children in units perceived as lower risk, 
such as the medical, finance, or intelligence 
units. These roles, typically involving less 
direct combat compared to frontline units, 
were considered safer. Families with strong 
connections within the LTTE leveraged 
these relationships to place their children in</p>

positions where they would be less exposed to 
the dangers of active conflict.
How did the LTTE enforce enlistment 
when families began hiding their 
children?
Around 2007, as families began hiding 
their children to avoid enlistment, LTTE 
units started using name lists to track down 
potential recruits. Parents often told the 
enlistment units that their children were not 
at home. In one instance in Mallavi, after a 
father claimed his son was absent, our unit 
monitored the house. It was subsequently 
discovered that the child was indeed inside. 
Our unit then entered the house and forcefully 
abducted him. 
When did full-scale ruthless forced 
recruitment start?
 Full-scale forced recruitment began in the 
middle of 2008. At this time, anyone who 
appeared capable of bearing arms, including 
very young children as young as 12 or 13 years 
old, was forcefully abducted. The recruitment 
criteria were based less on actual age and 
more on physical appearance; even our team 
abducted boys who were 12 or 13 years old but 
looked older and enlisted them.
What was the process for handling 
recruits once they were enlisted?
Once individuals were forcibly enlisted, 
they were initially sent to the Anpu base 
in Vaddakkachchi. From there, they were 
transferred to the main training base located in 
Muthaiyankattu.
During the intense periods of conflict, 
especially after the loss of Kilinochchi in 
December 2008, the atrocities related to forced 
enlistment escalated. By 2009, the criteria for 
enlistment focused solely on physical attributes 
like height rather than age.
At that time, the LTTE's traditional training 
bases were no longer functional; newly 
recruited individuals were sent to makeshift 
training camps in the Mullivaikal Palmyra 
grove. There, they received only a few days of 
basic weapons training before being sent to the 
frontline.
Upon enlistment, children's heads were 
shaved. I witnessed all the children at the 
training camp crying, clearly in shock and 
mentally unprepared for combat. There was 
also a severe lack of proper food and care, 
which added to their distress.
In February 2009, as the LTTE's territorial 
control diminished, LTTE guards without 
specific assignments were presented with 
two options: they could either go to the 
Front Defense Line (FDL) to fight or actively 
participate in child abduction. Additionally, 
each unit was restricted to having only a 
certain number of members. I can assert that 
all the members who actively engaged in child 
abduction did so to avoid being sent to the 
FDL.
Who was involved in child abduction 
because they did not want to go to the 
FDL?
 Many of us, including myself, were involved 
in child abduction to avoid being sent to the 
Front Defense Line (FDL).
Who within the LTTE supported the 
forced enlistment?</p>

Jeyam, a senior commander of the LTTE, explaining a strategic map to LTTE soldiers.
Several key figures within the LTTE supported 
and actively participated in forced enlistment. 
Thamilanpan, also known as Jawan, who 
was the head of the Voice of Tigers, and 
Thavapalan, the news editor of the Voice 
of Tigers, both publicly supported and 
participated in these activities. The police chief 
of the LTTE, Ramesh, actively took part in the 
abductions. Additionally, Seralathan of LTTE's 
National Television of Tamileelam (NTT) and 
Elilan, the head of the Policy Development 
Department, were also deeply involved. 
Many of these individuals within the LTTE 
contributed to this grievous act. 
 Who opposed the abductions within 
the LTTE?
Within the LTTE, there were individuals 
who vehemently opposed the practice of 
child abductions. Charles Antony regiment's 
special commander, Gopith, was one of them. 
I personally witnessed him arguing with 
Jawan about this issue. Gopith criticized the 
involvement of some LTTE members in child 
abduction rather than fighting at the Front 
Defense Line (FDL). He challenged Jawan 
to come to the FDL himself, to which Jawan 
responded dismissively, citing historical 
examples from Russia. Another leader who 
opposed these practices was Commander 
Jayam. I heard him express a wish to die rather 
than witness the atrocities of child abduction.
Did those who forcefully enlisted 
innocent children also enlist their own

children in the LTTE and send them to 
the Front Defense Line (FDL)?
I knew Jawan well. He involved his elder 
daughter in the movement but kept her with 
him instead of sending her to the battlefield. 
When Jawan surrendered alongside Pulidevan 
and Natesan, he took his daughter with them, 
and what followed is well known. 
Ilamparthi and Seralathan had underage 
children; they did not enlist them. Ilango 
was not married. Thavapalan had two sons; 
one was 13 years old, and the other was quite 
young if I remember correctly. He did not 
enlist them. Thavapalan's elder son now lives 
in Germany and is married to the daughter of 
Kapil Amman, one of the senior leaders of the 
intelligence wing.
How are you managing your 
conscience, given the role you played 
in the deaths of countless innocent 
children?</p>

It's a struggle. Initially, I didn't realize that 
forced enlistment was wrong, and I didn't 
recognize the mistakes in what I was doing. 
We abducted children from their hiding 
places; parents went to great lengths to 
hide their children, even digging holes 
inside their houses to keep their offspring 
concealed. We forcefully abducted children 
from these hideouts as well. However, as the 
war intensified and the LTTE-controlled 
area shrank to just a few kilometres, with no 
semblance of hope that the LTTE would win 
the war, we were still instructed to forcibly 
abduct children, regardless of age. At that 
point, I became aware that what we were 
doing was wrong. But I couldn't stop; if I had, 
I would have been sent to the Front Defense 
Line (FDL), where I likely would have died.
 Is it morally justifiable to make 
children die just to avoid being sent to 
the FDL, where you likely would have 
faced death?
It was a grave mistake, and I struggle with my 
conscience every day because of it. However, 
if I had been sent to the FDL, someone else 
would have taken my place and continued the 
brutal enlistments. 
Are you able to sleep peacefully, 
knowing that you were the reason for 
the deaths of hundreds of innocent 
children?
I am seeking many paths to redemption. 
I have turned to spirituality, looking for 
liberation from sin, but deep inside, I know I 
cannot escape from karma. Agreeing with this 
interview is also a way of telling the Sri Lankan 
Tamil population that, as a long-time member 
of the LTTE, there should never again be an 
organization or ideology like the LTTE that 
abducted its own children and made them die 
en masse.
