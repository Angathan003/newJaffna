What Prompted the Writing of the book 
'Nancakum Nilam'?
In my childhood, I witnessed an environment 
that has now dramatically altered. Over the 
span of just four decades, there has been 
a profound transformation in our natural 
surroundings. This metamorphosis has 
encompassed every facet of nature - the land, 
water, air, and forests. Today, it's a rarity to 
observe house sparrows and baya weavers, 
once a common sight in my youth, and the 
once-abundant butterflies are now seemingly 
extinct. Groundwater levels have plummeted 
drastically, from a mere twenty or thirty feet to 
depths of a hundred to two hundred feet.
Health issues that were once a rarity, such 
as heart attacks occurring in perhaps one 
in a thousand people, now affect thousands 
routinely. Diseases like diabetes and high 
cholesterol, virtually unheard of in the past, 
have become rampant, with people of all ages 
regularly lining up at medical facilities. Our 
era has transitioned from one where food was 
akin to medicine to a dire state where our 
food has transformed into a form of poison. 
If this downward spiral continues unchecked, 
the very essence of human survival will be in 
jeopardy.
When living conditions become untenable, 
animals and birds instinctively migrate from 
their habitats. Survival against nature's tide 
is a battle no species can win, yet humans 
uniquely strive to reshape nature to meet 
their own needs, often engaging in activities 
detrimental to the environment. Consequently, 
our ecosystem is experiencing severe 
repercussions. The damage we inflict on nature 
is now rebounding upon us like a boomerang.
The threat of global warming has escalated to a 
perilous level. As technological advancements 
progress, humans are becoming increasingly 
detached from the natural world. This 
detachment poses a significant threat to our 
well-being. This growing disconnect and 
the urgent need for a collective awakening

compelled me to pen my book as a call to 
action and awareness.
Your book mainly concentrates on the 
environmental issues that the Kilinochi 
district faces. What do you think is the 
most pressing environmental issue in 
the Kilinochchi District?
Kilinochchi District is a beautiful area rich 
in natural resources, with lakes, rivers, 
forests, and sand dunes. The beauty and 
wealth of Kilinochchi lie in preserving these. 
However, the district is facing environmental 
degradation in land, water, and forests.
The main problems include illegal sand and 
soil mining, encroachment and settlement 
in flood zones of lakes and seasonal rivers, 
wastage of water, illegal deforestation, 
and improper waste disposal. While it is 
inevitable to extract resources from nature for 
development activities, it is essential to adhere 
to meticulous and well-thought-out plans and 
follow the laws related to the conservation of 
natural resources. The benefits derived from 
exploiting these resources should not outweigh 
the harm caused.
But beyond these, the departments and police 
responsible for addressing environmental 
issues in Kilinochchi must take responsibility. 
There are many laws to protect the 
environment, but the weakness of those 
enforcing these laws is a significant reason for 
environmental degradation. Actions against 
the environment persist until Corruption and 
malpractice continue. 
What Essential Environmental 
Consciousness Should People 
Possess?
The essence of environmental awareness lies in 
recognizing the intrinsic connection between 
our safety and the health of our environment. 
The security of our lives is deeply intertwined 
with the condition of our surroundings. A 
secure environment is fundamental to the 
sustenance of life for all species. Therefore, it 
is crucial for both the public and governing 
authorities to comprehend that a lifestyle 
in discord with environmental norms is 
unsustainable.
This awareness involves understanding 
the broader impact of our actions on the

ecosystem. For instance, the removal of a 
single tree not only diminishes the oxygen 
available to various life forms but also 
disrupts the delicate balance of our ecosystem. 
Similarly, alterations in rainfall patterns can 
significantly impact food production, thereby 
affecting the entire food chain. Nature's 
equilibrium is predicated on the harmonious 
coexistence of diverse species. In our pursuit 
to secure material possessions such as land and 
homes for future generations, we often neglect 
the necessity to foster an environment that 
supports their well-being.
Another critical aspect of environmental 
consciousness is water conservation. With 
a staggering 97% of the world's water being 
saline, the minuscule 3% that constitutes 
freshwater becomes exceedingly precious. 
This small percentage is further subdivided, 
with 79% locked in glaciers and 20% existing 
as groundwater, leaving a mere 1% readily 
available for human use. This stark reality 
underscores the urgency for heightened 
conservation efforts and prudent management 
of this vital resource.
Our environmental responsibilities extend 
across various activities, from waste 
management to energy consumption. Each 
individual's conscientious actions, aimed 
at minimizing interference with nature, 
contribute significantly to environmental 
preservation. One of the most effective 
methods to foster a sustainable future is 
through cultivating widespread awareness 
about environmental stewardship. Educating 
people about the significance of their 
ecological footprint and encouraging. 
How Should Politicians Contribute to 
Environmental Causes? What Should 
Their Stance Towards the Environment 
Be?

Elected representatives 
should prioritize the 
public's best interest, as 
this is the cornerstone 
of a democratic election. 
However, in our current 
scenario, many politicians 
seem to base their actions 
on the potential gain or 
loss of votes rather than 
on the welfare of their 
constituents. A society 
thrives under good 
leadership, which is, 
regrettably, a quality we 
find lacking. Protecting 
a nation's heritage and 
its continued existence is deeply linked to 
preserving the environment. Unfortunately, 
it's uncommon to find leaders who genuinely 
cherish nature and actively commit to 
environmental conservation.
If the identity of a community is to be 
preserved, then its very existence must also be 
safeguarded. Integral to this safeguarding is 
the protection of the environment in which the 
community resides. Leaders who demonstrate 
a genuine love for nature and a commitment 
to environmental conservation are, regrettably, 
rare. Politicians need to broaden their efforts 
beyond merely securing votes when it comes 
to environmental issues. They should realize 
that in advocating for the environment, they 
are also preserving the support of their voter 
base.
Due to environmental degradation, as 
mentioned in my book, some villages in the 
north, like Kunjukulam, have disappeared. 
If the number of such disappearing villages 
increases, it will eventually affect the 
politicians' vote banks. Therefore, for this 
reason alone, if not for the greater good, 
politicians should come forward to protect the 
environment.
As long as politicians provide relief packages 
funded by illegal sand mining to people 
affected by floods and drought, how can the 
environment be protected?
What Are the Immediate Necessary 
Changes for Addressing Environmental 
Issues?
Increasing awareness among the populace is 
essential, highlighting that coexistence with 
the environment, rather than antagonism, is 
vital for survival. Environmental laws must 
be enforced impartially and rigorously, with 
strict legal actions against illegal sand mining, 
deforestation, and improper waste disposal. 
It is crucial to start environmental education 
at the school level and extend it into the 
broader community. Without such proactive 
actions and heightened awareness, effectively 
safeguarding our environment remains a 
formidable challenge.

A 
young man embodying the essence of resilience and 
determination has recently rewritten Sri Lankan cricket 
history. Pathum Nissanka, a name that resonates with 'hope' in 
the Sinhala language, has achieved a historic feat as the first Sri 
Lankan to score a double-century in an ODI. This remarkable 
achievement, however, is just the climax of a story that began 
much earlier, deeply rooted in his father, Sunil Silva's unrealized 
dreams and the steadfast dedication of his family.

Sunil Silva's dream of cricketing glory was 
never nurtured in his youth, leaving him 
with a void he yearned to fill through his 
offspring. It was the birth of Pathum on 
May 18, 1998, that rekindled Sunil's hope. 
From the moment Pathum could walk, Sunil 
embarked on a mission to sculpt his son into 
a cricketer of world-class stature.
Pathum's early life was not one of privilege 
but one of persistent struggle. The Silva 
family, grappling with financial hardships, 
lived a life far removed from the glitz and 
glamour of international cricket. Yet, it was 
in the dusty lanes and modest cricket fields 
of Kalutara that Pathum's talent blossomed 
under his father's strict yet loving guidance. 
Pathum's mother sold flowers to devotees 
near the Kalutara Temple, and his father, 
who lacked basic education and faced 
financial challenges, created a backdrop of 
struggle and adversity that shaped Pathum's 
early years. Their residence, a modest 
abode in Kalutara, stood in stark contrast 
to the grandeur of the international cricket 
stadiums where Pathum's destiny would 
eventually unfold.
Sunil, a groundsman turned junior coach, 
instilled in his son not just the techniques 
of the game but the ethos of hard work 
and perseverance. Academic pursuits took 
a backseat as cricket became the central 
focus of Pathum's life. This decision, often 
contested within the family, was a gamble 
Sunil was willing to take, driven by a singular 
vision of seeing his son don the national 
colors.
Pathum's cricketing journey was bolstered 
by the mentorship of Sunil Saluwadana, 
who had previously guided the likes of T.M. 
Dilshan. Moving to Isipathana College in 
Colombo, a school known for its cricketing 
prowess, Pathum's talent began to shine 
brighter. His dedication and technical 
proficiency led him to score over 1000 
runs in the 2017 season, a testament to his 
growing prowess.
His debut in international cricket in 
March 2021 was marked by ESPNcricinfo's 
prediction of him being Sri Lanka's next great 
Test batter. The prediction wasn't misplaced. 
Pathum's temperament, technical soundness, 
and ability to adapt were evident from his 
first match. Mickey Arthur, then head coach, 
saw in him the future of Sri Lankan cricket, 
not just in Tests but in all formats.
And then came the monumental 
innings against Afghanistan, a display 
of skill, endurance, and mental fortitude 
that propelled him into the league of 
extraordinary cricketers. His double-century 
was a knock that defied expectations, broke 
stereotypes, and showed the world what 
sheer willpower can achieve.
As Pathum raised his bat in the stands, his 
father's eyes glistened with pride. Every 
early morning training session, sacrifice, 
and moment of doubt led to this. Pathum's 
achievement was not just his own but a 
culmination of his family's unwavering 
support and sacrifice.
Currently, Pathum Nissanka embodies 
a symbol of hope and an illustration of 
the strength of dreams. His ascent from a 
life marked by struggles to the zenith of 
international cricket narrates a tale of fervent 
passion, relentless perseverance, and the 
indomitable spirit of a family who dared to 
dream.

Shamar Joseph: 
Cricket's Unlikely Hero
I
n cricket, where legends often emerge from 
the manicured grounds of elite academies 
and affluent clubs, the saga of Shamar Joseph 
stands apart, shimmering with a unique allure. 
Hailing from the hidden maroon enclave of 
Baracara in Guyana, a village as enigmatic 
and little-known as the mythical Wakanda, 
Joseph has navigated a remarkable odyssey 
to the pinnacle of international cricket. Far 
from the traditional pathways, his journey is 
determination and raw talent, unfolding in an 
environment far removed from the spotlight's 
glare. Joseph's ascent is a testament to the fact 
that, sometimes, the most extraordinary tales 
of success are scripted in the most unexpected 
settings, bringing a fresh and exhilarating 
narrative to the world of cricket.
Baracara, accessible only by a two-hour boat 
ride from New Amsterdam, is a tiny village 
standing by the Canje Creek in Guyana's 
North Eastern region. Home to no more than 
400 souls, Joseph's astounding achievements 
thrust this village, where the primary sports 
were once Dominoes and cricket, into the 
limelight.

His journey is one of defiance against the 
odds. As the West Indies clinched a historic 
Test win against Australia at their 'fortress 
Gabba', a feat only achieved once since 1988, 
Baracara's very own son, Shamar Joseph, led 
the charge. His seven-wicket haul in Brisbane, 
following an injury setback caused by Mitchell 
Starc's yorker, has etched his name in the 
annals of cricketing greats.
What makes Joseph's story remarkable is 
not just his on-field heroics but the path he 
traversed to reach there. Less than a year ago, 
Joseph wasn't even a first-class cricketer. Turn 
the clock back to 2021, and he was working 
as a security guard in Berbice. Fast forward to 
January 2024, and he is a top contender for the 
ICC's Test Cricketer of the Month honour.
Growing up in Baracara, cricket was more 
a pastime than a pursuit. Orlando Tanner, 
Joseph's cousin, reminisces about their 
childhood days playing 'jungle-land cricket' by 
the waterfront near Shamar's house. With no 
luxury of proper cricket balls, they improvised 
with fruits or melted plastic from bottles.
Their passion for the sport was undeterred 
by religious constraints. As Seventh-Day 
Adventist Christians, playing cricket on 
Saturdays, their holy day, was forbidden. 
Joseph's adherence to his faith meant he never 
played youth cricket.
Joseph's leap from a village boy to a cricket 
sensation is nothing short of a cinematic saga. 
Damion Vantull, a former Guyanese cricketer-
turned-businessman, played a pivotal role in 
this. Recognising Joseph's potential during 
a visit to Baracara, Vantull supported him in 
leaving his security job and pursuing cricket in 
Georgetown.
In Georgetown, Joseph's talent blossomed. 
His first delivery in the Muslim Youth 
Organisation Sports Club practice nets 
broke the wicket keeper's hand, a testament 
to his raw pace and power. His ascent was 
rapid; within a year, he was part of Guyana's 
national side, thanks to the intervention of 
Esuan Crandon, the head coach and brother of 
Royston Crandon, who had initially brought 
Vantull to Baracara.
Joseph's story is a beacon of hope for West 
Indies cricket, where talent often gets lost 
in the tussle between boards and players. 
His journey from the remote Baracara to 
international cricket stardom is a testament 
to the raw talent in the world's most secluded 
corners. Talent that doesn't just compete but 
triumphs against the sport's greats on the first 
go.
In a region once known for its cricketing 
might, stories like Joseph's are a reminder 
of the unexplored potential waiting to be 
discovered. For the people of Baracara and 
cricket enthusiasts worldwide, Shamar Joseph 
is more than a cricketer; he symbolises what 
can be achieved against all odds. Damion 
Vantull aptly says, "He won't be satisfied 
by this one series. He won't be a one-shot 
wonder." With such determination and skill, 
the odds are indeed in Joseph's favour.
