To the Editor of Jaffna Monitor,
I write to express deep 
concerns about the recent 
publication of an interview 
with Maravanpulavu K. 
Sachithananthan titled "The 
Heart, Not Temples, the True 
Abode for Rama Worship" 
in your esteemed magazine's 
February 1st issue. While 
the principle of diverse 
viewpoints is a cornerstone 
of democratic discourse, the 
decision to provide a platform 
to individuals known for their 
divisive and harmful rhetoric 
is troubling, especially in a 
region like Jaffna, which values 
religious harmony.
Maravanpulavu 
Sachithananthan is a figure 
who has gained notoriety for 
his controversial and often 
unverified claims, which many 
perceive as veering toward 
religious bigotry. He created 
an organization called 'Siva 
Senai' in parallel with the ultra-

Hindu organizations of India. His organization's name is also 
derived from Maharashtra's Shiv Sena, known for multiple 
instances of religious violence in Maharashtra and across India. 
His rhetorical claims about the Ram temple and his statement, 
"During their colonial endeavors in Sri Lanka, the Portuguese 
demolished revered Hindu temples such as Thiruketheeswaram, 
Thirukoneswaram, and Thondeeswaram, replacing the latter 
with a Christian church," raise questions about his motives. 
Does he intend to demolish that church and build a Hindu 
temple again? Is he aiming to create religious problems in the 
northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka? His narrow-minded 
thoughts, when disseminated through respected media outlets, 
run the risk of legitimizing these divisive viewpoints, potentially 
stoking communal tensions in a society that has worked 
tirelessly to foster peace and unity among its diverse religious 
communities.
Furthermore, it is imperative to remember the collective 
struggle of Sri Lankan Tamils for a separate land. This 
movement was strengthened by the solidarity and contributions 
of Tamils from every religious background. Each religion played 
a pivotal role. Overemphasizing a single religious perspective, as 
often done by Mr. Sachithananthan, not only undermines this 
collective effort but also disrespects the diverse contributions of 
our community.
There are also concerns about Mr. Sachithananthan's potential 
agenda to stir up religious disharmony in Jaffna. His consistent 
endeavors in this direction are alarming and counterproductive 
to the ongoing efforts to maintain peace and communal 
harmony in the region. Media outlets like yours must be vigilant 
in not becoming conduits for such divisive agendas.
I urge the Jaffna Monitor to reconsider the implications of 
giving voice to such controversial figures. The media's role in 
maintaining communal harmony is paramount. I advocate for 
a more balanced and inclusive approach in journalism that 
respects and reflects our society's diverse religious and cultural 
fabric, contributing towards the peace and unity we all cherish.
Sincerely, 
K.Raveendran

f Cricket were a big family, the West Indies 
would be that uncle who used to be the 
lifeblood of any party with unparalleled dance 
moves that caught everyone awestruck; they 
are that uncle with a great sense of humour 
who could liven up any dull moment, they are 
that uncle who had a swagger which others 
could not even imagine to have.
But today, that uncle is paralysed, immobile, 
and bedridden.
A mild movement of an eyelid or perhaps 
a flinch of muscle fibre is good to excite 
everyone in the family in the hope of the better 
times of the past returning against all odds.

But reality backed by logic and science would 
suggest otherwise.
As Shamar Joseph led the West Indies to an 
unimaginable win at the Gabba in the second 
Test versus Australia, delivering perhaps 
an all-time great spell of fast bowling, the 
whole cricketing fraternity was excited. This 
excitement stemmed more from admiration 
for the West Indians and a desperate hope 
for a West Indian resurgence than animosity 
towards Australia. Nothing would explain 
it more than the scenes in the commentary 
box. One of the Australian stalwarts, Adam 
Gilchrist, was elated and genuinely celebrating 
with Brian Lara despite his own team ending 
up on the wrong side of the equation. Aussie 
skipper Cummins was warm and gracious, 
always echoing the cricketing fraternity's 
thoughts and indirectly hinting that the fanboy 
in him couldn't stop getting excited by the win 
for the men in maroon.
All these observations suggest one clear fact. 
The cricketing world requires and hopes 
for the West Indies to come back to life. 
The flamboyance of their batters, the fire in 
their bowlers, and the fun index of the men 
from the Caribbean as a whole, mixed with a 
plethora of characters, add colour to the game 
we love. Shamar Joseph's spell at the Gabba 
or even at Adelaide in his first-ever outing 
is a testament to the colour they add to the 
game. The salute to the crowd by the young 
fast bowler after his five-wicket haul while 
walking away shows the attitude the men from 
the Caribbean bring to the game. Imagine a 
debutant being brave enough to have his own 
celebratory act and display it to the Aussie 
crowd. If you know the Australian spectators,

the magnitude of the act will speak for itself.
All that is great. Have we reached the tipping 
point signalling the revival of Caribbean 
Cricket? Would the Gabba win turn the tide? 
You may ask. The answer is perhaps not. That's 
not pessimism but probabilism. Here's why.
West Indies have often pulled off the 
unthinkable since their Cricket hit a nadir at 
the turn of the millennium.
It was an absolute heist for the West Indies to 
win the 2004 Champions Trophy in England, 
triumphing over the hosts through the unlikely 
heroics of Ian Bradshaw and Courtney 
Brown. In 2012, Marlon Samuels' spectacular 
performance decimated Malinga's bowling, 
stunning a packed Premadasa stadium that 
was nearly poised to celebrate a Sri Lankan 
victory in the World T20, especially after 
the first 10 overs of the West Indies innings. 
A reality-defying blitz by Carlos Brathwaite 
topped off another World T20 win for the West 
Indies in the most dramatic fashion in 2016 at 
Kolkata.
A Chase-Hope partnership led the fourth 
inning 322 chase, stunning England at 
Headingley in 2017, and the list goes on. Each 
of these had the potential to bring life to our 
long-lost friends, yet they didn't. It was always 
a case of a spike of hope followed by plateaued 
progress and, more often than not, a decline 
accelerated by controversies in administration. 
The Gabba is the latest addition to this mind-
blowing list. Is it any different? Perhaps not. 
The reason?
The downfall of the West Indies lies in the

administrative weaknesses, with many 
individual entities running with varying 
agendas. Lack of a collective identity, too, is 
considered a major contributory factor. To 
make matters worse, the lack of financial 
muscle makes retention of talent an impossible 
task in a world of financially lucrative T20 
leagues. How they manage Shamar Joseph 
and preserve him for the Test format and 
even West Indies Cricket will be a litmus test 
indicating the sustainability or the potential 
for any progress in the West Indies. Until this 
fundamental flaw is corrected, West Indies 
would painfully remain dormant, much to the 
disappointment of the cricketing fraternity. 
Gabba-like wins would occur from time to 
time and provide hope to fans. But reality 
would possibly remain the same.
As disappointing as it may be, the ICC has to 
take the blame, too. It should have seen this 
coming. Instead, the ICC was focused on the 
goldmine emerging out of the subcontinent. 
Lack of focus and inequitable attention 
resulted in the flare of the men in maroon 
being lost. A World Cup without the West 
Indies also became a reality despite being 
unimaginable in the years that passed by. 
That's the level of decline the region everybody 
adores has gone through. Not only in the 
West Indies but also in many other casualties. 
Zimbabwe, Kenya and perhaps Sri Lanka too. 
If there had been foresight and genuine interest 
from regional and global administrators, the 
game would have been far richer in content 
and quality than it is today.
But as things stand, the Cricketing family's 
famous uncle is immobile. Like before, on 
many occasions, he has slightly moved. 
Perhaps Gabba was more than a move. A 
smile reminds us how good things were back. 
Unfortunately, as the underlying fundamentals 
remain dismantled, the smile would just be 
transient, and we hope there would be a few 
more smiles more frequently. Perhaps a few 
more Gabba-like wins and perhaps a few more 
Shamar Josephs to instil hope and belief.
Cricket needs West Indies more than West 
Indies need Cricket. For that, a few more 
Shamar Josephs and Gabba breaches would 
infuse much-needed adrenaline to bring back 
life to the men in maroon.

Story
O
nce upon a time there was a person in Sri Lanka 
called Kandy Warrior. Apparently, a Tamil 
militant group had sentenced him to death. It also 
seems that the same group had later rescinded the 
sentence. I am not aware of anything more regarding 
the story of Kandy Warrior.
However, such an event was extremely rare in the 
history of our struggle. Hardly anyone who was 
caught by a militant group managed to escape to 
Kandy Warrior

freedom. In particular this was the only 
instance ever where a death sentence was 
rescinded. From the time I first heard about 
Kandy Warrior I could not help puzzling over 
how this came to pass. I was very eager to 
write the story of Kandy Warrior. But I was 
not able to even imagine how it might have 
happened.
Recently I read a short story by Leo Tolstoy 
called ‘Too Dear!’ (Дорого стоит) which 
he adapted from an earlier story by Guy de 
Maupassant. Ākụ̄ r Ānandhāchāriyār had 
translated it into Tamil with an unusually 
long title meaning ‘who can afford to feed an 
elephant?’ Suddenly it occurred to me that 
this story that took place in Europe in 1897 
possibly resembles Kandy Warrior’s story that 
happened in Sri Lanka in 1984. Tell me, how 
else could Kandy Warrior have cheated death!
Therefore, permit me to borrow Tolstoy’s 
story and shoehorn Kandy Warrior’s saga into 
it.
Around 1984, it is estimated that there were 
around thirty-seven armed Tamil militant 
groups, big and small, in Sri Lanka. The 
tiniest among the thirty-seven was called 
‘Revolutionary Organization of Socialist 
Tamil Eelam.’ For the sake of brevity, they 
referred to themselves as ROSTE.
There were only six members in that group. 
Every one of them was in the twenty- 
to thirty-year-old range. The group’s 
Revolutionary Executive Central Committee 
consisted of all six. 
ROSTE advertised itself as a movement on 
the extreme left of the political spectrum. 
Its political project was to rally farmers and 
workers to mount a continuous guerilla war 
against the Sri Lankan military to establish 
Tamil Eelam as a separate socialist country. 
At the time the Indian army was training 
many Eelam Tamil militant groups. Leading 
political figures in the state of Tamil Nadu 
in India, M.G.R and Karuṇānidhi, were 
competing with one another to provide funds 
for these groups. But ROSTE had resolved, 
as a matter of doctrine, that ROSTE would 
not rely on India. Every month, their Central 
Committee would pass motions to resolve that 
they would not use Tamil Nadu as base, and 
that their movement would be nurtured only 
on Eelam soil.
Despite being a tiny militant movement of 
merely six people. ROSTE firmly believed 
that theirs was the one fighting with a firm 
ideological foundation on the right path 
towards Tamil Eelam. ROSTE was second 
to none in publishing calls to action from 
time to time. It also invited other Tamil 
militant groups to ideological debates. 
When the armed military operations of 
other groups failed, ROSTE did extensive 
research as to why those operations failed 
militarily and published their conclusions as 
political pamphlets. Without fail, all those 
pamphlets ended with ‘When the people’s 
revolutionary army of ROSTE begins its 
military operations, it will result in great 
victories.’ Nevertheless, one must say that 
ROSTE received absolutely no support from 
the public. Members of ROSTE struggled to 
put food on their plates.
The ROSTE movement camped out in a small 
village eight kilometers from Jaffna town. A 
dilapidated large stone mansion surrounded 
by high walls served as their camp. The 
owners of the house were in America. 
Therefore, ROSTE occupied the house 
without succumbing to any guilty conscience. 
The village had a small high street with four 
kiosks. People always milled about on the 
high street, talking politics. ROSTE levied 
taxes on those high street shops. Because

shopkeepers had to pay taxes for multiple 
armed groups, ROSTE’s share was indeed 
minuscule. Still ROSTE managed to scrimp 
and save from the two-rupee or five-rupee 
taxes they collected, by sometimes half 
starving themselves and imposing the self-
discipline of rationing only four cigarettes 
per person every day. This way, ROSTE had 
managed to save two thousand rupees by then.
One evening, while they were out collecting 
their tax on the high street, they saw a mob of 
people beating up a petty thief who had been 
caught red-handed. The thief was tall, had a 
strong constitution, and had the complexion 
of a palmyra tree. His googly eyes were 
bloodshot. He was wearing a white sarong 
and a purple shirt. Despite all the beating, the 
thief remained silent, rooted to the spot where 
he was standing.
ROSTE intervened and rescued the thief from

the mob. They removed his shirt and used it 
to blindfold him. They borrowed a piece of 
jute rope from a shop to tie his hands behind 
his back. That was in fact the first time people 
on the high street had seen ROSTE in an 
operation. Only when ROSTE went out to 
collect taxes the next day did they realize that 
this operation had raised their esteem in the 
eyes of the people.
ROSTE marched the thief to their camp 
for further interrogation. A green vehicle 
belonging to a larger militant group came 
by. The leader of that group asked, “What is 
the problem?” One of the ROSTE members 
responded stiffly, “Comrade, we have taken 
responsibility for this problem, we will take 
care of it.”
Once at the camp, the thief was made to sit 
on the floor, surrounded by the members of 
the Central Committee. The interrogation 
proceeded, with the Central Committee 
throwing question after question at the 
thief. The entire interrogation was earnestly 
recorded in a register.

They learned that the thief was from Kandy. 
His name was Kānthirājaṉ. The group did not 
like this name in the first place. Therefore, 
they called him by referring to his hometown, 
‘Kandy.’ They referred to him by this name in 
the interrogation report.
In contrast to his stoic silence when he was 
being beaten on the high street, he was 
garrulous in front of the Central Committee. 
He liked the discipline and the refined 
interrogation practices of ROSTE. The 
members of ROSTE, sitting around him, 
listened to his exploits with gaping mouths.
He was born in an estate in Kandy, a 
descendant of people who had fled to escape 
famine in the Sivagaṅgai region of Tamil 
Nadu to Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon. 
When he was ten, he was taken to a home in 
Jaffna as domestic help. Astonishingly, his 
employers had also called him ‘Kandy.’
Kānthirājaṉ’s life of crime began when, at 
fifteen, he dropped a rock on the lady of the 
house that employed him, stole a little money, 
and fled to Kandy. Thereafter, his trajectory 
went through Colombo, Galle, Vavuṉiyā, 
and so on. There was no town that he did not 
wander into, no mischief he did not get up to, 
no fight he did not get into, no whore he did 
not bed, no police beating he did not endure, 
and no jailhouse he did not get thrown into.
Eventually, he ended up as a gangster for the 
Kandy drug dealer kudu bāss. He hung around 
in the area behind the Kandy railway station, 
known for retail drug trade. His job was to 
watch out for the police or the agents from 
the Division of Narcotic Control in disguise. 
Whenever fighting broke out between the 
gangsters of Sivam nānā, another drug dealer, 
and the gangsters of kudu bāss, Kānthirājaṉ 
was the first to jump into the fray on behalf of 
kudu bāss. He had the strength to down a man 
with a single blow.
There was a revolutionary party in Kandy. 
The party had its small trade union. The 
leader of this trade union was Raṇasiri. When 
Thaṉabālasingam mudalāli asked kudu bāss to 
rattle this trade union leader a little, kudu bāss 
sent Kānthirājaṉ’s to do the job. Kānthirājaṉ 
went alone to the union leader’s house, 
threatened to kill him, and returned. There 
were many witnesses who saw him utter the 
threat. A couple of nights later, union leader 
Raṇasiri’s dead body was found on the street, 
killed by stabbing.
Kānthirājaṉ tried to convince kudu bāss that 
he did not murder the union leader. But kudu 
bāss just swore at him, showering him with 
obscenities. Shortly thereafter, kudu bāss 
absconded. The police were on a manhunt to 
find Kānthirājaṉ who promptly escaped to 
Jaffna. The police’s jurisdiction did not extend 
to Jaffna. This was the time when the police, 
fearful of the various militant movements, 
were closing down police stations in Jaffna. 
There were a few places in Jaffna frequented 
by intelligence officers. They, too, were 
periodically gunned down by the militant 
groups. Thereafter, Kānthirājaṉ earned a 
living via petty theft.
ROSTE recorded Kānthirājaṉ’s confessions 
to the letter. Behind the main house that 
served as the camp, there was a small room 
by the rear wall within the same compound. 
Perhaps it was built as the servants’ quarters. 
ROSTE imprisoned Kānthirājaṉ in this 
room, designated one of their members 
to stand guard outside, and the remaining 
five analyzed and debated Kānthirājaṉ’s 
confessions in detail.
There were a number of charges against 
Kānthirājaṉ: violence, theft, thuggery, 
unbridled sexual relations, drug trafficking, 
and premeditated murder. The consensus 
within ROSTE was that he was an antisocial 
person beyond any reasonable doubt.

Therefore, in accordance with the rules of 
their movement at that time, they sentenced 
him to death. It was decided that he would be 
tied to the lamp post on the high street and 
shot to death.
When the sentence was announced to 
Kānthirājaṉ, he protested “This is unjust 
sāmi, how can you punish me for a murder I 
did not commit?” Yet, there was no appeal to 
the death sentence that ROSTE had passed. 
Generally, they deliberated at length before 
making a decision. But once a decision is 
made, they stood by it firmly.
But there was a complication in carrying out 
the death sentence. ROSTE did not own a 
gun they can use to shoot Kānthirājaṉ. They 
decided to seek help from another militant 
group that was militarily better endowed. 
They sent a request to this group asking what 
it would cost to rent a gun for a day and 
purchase two bullets.
The other movement responded that they 
could not rent out a gun, but they could send 
a gun along with an expert gunman drawn 
from their ranks who could do the job cleanly 
and that this would cost ROSTE ten thousand 
rupees.
ROSTE was shocked to learn this. Why 
should they spend ten thousand rupees on 
account of this Kandy murderer? Where on 
earth would they find ten thousand in the first 
place? Could they not carry out the sentence 
more cheaply? They debated these questions 
at length.
They conjectured that the first group that 
they had approached had capitalist leanings, 
which explained the unreasonably exorbitant 
amount they greedily demanded. Besides, 
they also noted that this movement generally 
did not respect ROSTE. Therefore, the Central 
Committee decided to approach a leftist group 
in the belief that they would accord greater 
respect to ROSTE's request. They then sent a 
request for help to a left-leaning group which 
also had plenty of arms.
This left-leaning group said they would 
charge five thousand rupees to send a comrade 
with a gun. They also said that if ROSTE 
only wanted to rent the gun, it would cost 
three thousand in rent, but would require a 
further six thousand as deposit. ROSTE could 
not afford this either. In the dire financial 
situation they were in, how could they justify 
spending so much money on a murderer? 
If they in fact had that kind of money, they 
could have started their own newspaper. With 
thoughts like these, once again they focused 
on researching how they could carry out the 
death sentence economically, staying within 
their means.
They wondered if they could implement the 
death sentence in some other way, thereby 
avoiding all this messing around with guns. 
When someone proposed stabbing with a 
knife, the majority in the Central Committee 
objected that it was an inhuman practice 
dating from the days of barbarism. Killing by 
beating was ruled out, not so much because 
none of the group members had enough 
courage to attempt it, but rather because 
Kānthirājaṉ was not frail enough to die 
when he was beaten. His body was like steel. 
Death by poisoning was also rejected by a 
majority in the Central Committee. That is 
the style of coup makers and conspirators. No 
revolutionary organization will ever resort to 
poisoning.
Finally, the Central Committee came to the 
firm conclusion that they would just buy 
their own inexpensive gun, even if it was 
rickety or second hand. On further inquiry, 
it transpired that even ancient guns from the 
Paṇdāravaṉṉiyaṉ era were not available for 
less than four thousand rupees. Where would

they go for that kind of money! 
Even foregoing food to scrimp 
and save from the meager taxes 
they collect from the small 
high street would still take 
them another two full years to 
collect that amount. Could they 
continue to pay for the care of 
this Kandy murderer until then?
ROSTE’s rule book stated that 
prisoners need to be fed thrice 
a day and given tea twice a day. 
They could also get an oil bath 
once a week. First the prisoner 
was given four cigarettes each 
day. Thereafter, on the request 
of the prisoner, cigarettes were 
replaced by a bundle of beedis.
Like clockwork and without 
fail, food from the ROSTE 
camp kitchen was taken to 
the room where Kānthirājaṉ 
was held. Having eaten well 
thrice a day without having 
to exert himself, Kānthirājaṉ 
had noticeably put on weight 
within a month. There was a 
new shine to his skin. He led a 
cushy life, sleeping comfortably 
and enjoying smokes when he 
was not sleeping. At the end of 
the month, when the Central 
Committee inspected their 
accounts, they discovered that 
holding the prisoner had cost 
them about a thousand rupees. 
The Central Committee was 
utterly shaken once again.
They started to agonize again 
as to how to compensate for 
this loss of funds and how 
to reduce the expenses of 
holding a prisoner. There was 
consternation at the thought that this Kandy murderer from 
nowhere was consuming ROSTE’s hard-earned tax revenue 
from the people. They even entertained the idea of freeing 
the prisoner. But they hesitated, as rescinding the death 
sentence of an antisocial character without cause would 
amount to a doctrinal deviation.
It was then that one of the members put forward a good 
solution.
“Now we take turns guarding him day and night. Going 
forward, we don’t need to guard him.”
“But if there is no guard, he will escape.”
“Let him escape! With that, the curse on us will be lifted, 
too… What do we stand to lose if he runs away? The 
movement will save money.”
From the next day onwards, the guard in front of 
Kānthirājaṉ’s room was removed, and the door was left 
open. At mealtime, when no food showed up, Kānthirājaṉ 
shouted for food. It did not look like anyone heard him.
Hunger gnawed at Kānthirājaṉ. He stepped out of his prison

room slowly, looked around, and walked over 
to the camp to ask for food. When he was 
given food, he walked back to the prison room 
to eat it and go to sleep. The same sequence 
repeated in the following days. He went to 
the camp thrice a day to ask for food, tea, and 
beedis and returned to the room to consume 
them. He was enjoying life. It did not look as 
if he had any intention of escaping.
Differences in opinion within the Central 
Committee began to emerge, lamenting “For 
how long can we put up with this wretch?” 
The person who made the suggestion for 
removing the prison guard also took on the 
responsibility for handling this problem. He 
said, “If we wait passively for him to escape, 
it will not come to pass; we have to trick him 
into escaping.”
He casually strolled towards the room where 
the prisoner was imprisoned. Inside, the 
prisoner sat cross-legged, happily smoking 
a beedi. When he saw a ROSTE member 
approach, he hurriedly put out his beedi 
by squelching it on the ground, stuck the 
extinguished beedi behind his ear, and stood 
up respectfully. The visitor started chatting.
“What is up, you look as if you are feeling 
down today. You must be missing your wife 
and kids.”
“Let them be, sāmi. Asses!”
“Why are you so hard on them? They must be 
distressed, not having seen you for so long.”
“It will be difficult for them if I am there.. 
Now they have peace of mind.”
“Somehow, I pity you. Even though you say 
this, I am sure you want to see your wife and 
children. You have not been guarded for a 
while. Why don’t you run away? If you need 
money for the bus, I will give it to you. I will 
also persuade my comrades not to come after 
you.”
The prisoner sat down again cross-legged. He 
then lit a beedi as he talked.
“That wouldn’t be right, sāmi. You removed 
the guard because you trusted me. How can I 
betray your trust?”
“It is no betrayal, Kandy. We won’t worry if 
you run away.”
“Where can I run away to sāmi? The whole 
world knows that you sentenced me to death. 
Who will employ me now? How will I 
survive, tell me?”
The ROSTE member was at his wit’s end. He 
started to walk back to the camp. The prisoner 
called out behind him:
“Sāmi, please shut the door behind you.”
By now it was crystal clear to the Central 
Committee that the prisoner had no intention 
of escaping. Once again, they strained their 
brains and came up with a solution. The 
decision was that no matter the cost—even if 
it meant pawning one of their own heads—
they must immediately acquire a gun to carry 
out the death sentence.
In those days it was routine for militant 
groups to carry out bank robberies. ROSTE 
too decided to rob a bank to buy a gun with 
which they could get rid of the prisoner.
They chose a small rural bank as their target, 
and meticulously planned the robbery. They 
drew up detailed maps. There was only one 
guard at the rural bank. Before ten in the 
morning, there was hardly any human traffic 
in the bank or the street it was located in. 
The metal gate of the bank always remained 
closed. The guard stood behind the gate

holding a long staff. He first interrogated each 
visitor, allowed only one person in at a time, 
and closed the gate behind them. Only after 
the previous visitor exited the bank would he 
admit the next one. 
Members of ROSTE would drive to the 
bank at nine in the morning, pretending to be 
intelligence officers in civil garb. Asserting, 
‘One of the bank employees is a terrorist 
suspect, we have come to arrest him,’ they 
would enter the bank and proceed to burgle it. 
That was the plan.
The primary flaw in this plan was that the 
bank guard would be deceived only if a 
purported intelligence officer was able to 
speak to the guard in Sinhala. But no one 
in ROSTE could speak Sinhala. After a day 
of intense debate, the Central Committee 
resolved to incorporate the prisoner 
Kānthirājaṉ into the plan because he could 
speak Sinhala flawlessly. Besides, his 
height and build made him a very plausible 
intelligence officer. Scarcity and hunger had 
made ROSTE members look malnourished

weaklings compared to the dazzling 
appearance of Kānthirājaṉ.
On the planned day, ROSTE rented a car 
to take them to the rural bank. Kānthirājaṉ, 
smartly dressed, led the way, followed by 
three members of ROSTE. Another acted as 
the getaway driver and kept the engine of the 
car running.
During his career, Kānthirājaṉ had 
encountered more than his share of 
intelligence officers and interrogations. So, 
he could play the role of a senior intelligence 
official to perfection. Only when they neared 
the bank did they notice that the guard had a 
gun.
The three ROSTE members behind 
Kānthirājaṉ began to falter when they saw the 
gun, their legs turning to jelly. They gaped 
at one another as if to ask, “Should we run 
away?” The intelligence they had gathered 
from their earlier reconnaissance was indeed 
flawless. How could they have known that, 
just the previous day, the escalating bank 
robberies in the North had prompted the 
government to issue older repeater rifles even 
to the guards at rural banks?
But Kānthirājaṉ maintained his confident 
stride even after seeing the gun. He marched 
up to the guard, and swiftly raised his right 
hand to his chest. Startled, the guard snapped 
to a proper salute. When senior officers meet 
someone junior in the forces, they usually 
offer a grudging, half-hearted salute, hand 
raised to their chest. When Kānthirājaṉ barked 
out a couple of words in Sinhala, the iron gate 
opened wide. As soon as he entered through 
the gate, Kānthirājaṉ grabbed the guard’s 
gun by his left hand while slapping his cheek 
hard with his right. The guard fainted and 
collapsed. Kānthirājaṉ held the gun aloft 
and beckoned to the ROSTE members to 
follow him. They scuttled behind him, with 
Kānthirājaṉ leading them into the bank.
There was hardly anything in the bank. An 
exhaustive search only yielded a hundred 
or so rupees in chump change. They 
grabbed what they could and escaped, with 
Kānthirājaṉ sitting smartly in the front seat 
of the car. They abandoned the car next to a 
deserted beach and walked back to the camp. 
When they reached the camp, Kānthirājaṉ 
retreated to his room carrying the gun. 
ROSTE members, watching this, gulped.
The credit for absconding with the gun was 
entirely Kānthirājaṉ’s. It rankled ROSTE to 
acknowledge that they had played absolutely 
no role in it. In fact, the bitter truth was that 
ROSTE members were prepared to run away 
as soon as they saw the gun-wielding guard. 
Therefore legitimately, Kānthirājaṉ was the 
rightful new owner of the gun.
But ROSTE thought that it was dangerous to 
leave such an antisocial criminal in possession 
of a gun. Besides, how could they sleep 
peacefully knowing that their prisoner had a 
gun. How could they be certain that he would 
not bump them off in their mats as they slept? 
Furthermore, they needed a gun urgently. It 
was what could help them carry out the death 
sentence against Kānthirājaṉ. Therefore, the 
Central Committee resolved to confiscate the 
gun from him.
The six members of the Central Committee 
prepared themselves for any eventuality and 
marched to the prison room. Kānthirājaṉ 
sat squatting on the floor with the gun 
disassembled and laid out before him.
“This is a really ancient gun, sāmi. It is not 
in a usable condition. It should be oiled and 
repaired if we want to make use of it.”
“Kandy, do you know how to take apart a gun 
and put it back together?”

“Yes, I know sāmi. I have gone hunting with 
my friends.”
The Central Committee returned to the 
camp. Seeing the gun disassembled and 
spread out on the floor in so many pieces 
eroded any confidence they had in using it. 
They proceeded to debate late into the night, 
sacrificing sleep. At four in the morning, their 
camp was surrounded by another militant 
group.
This other group was a big one. It did not like 
competing groups. It planned to attack and 
eliminate such groups when the opportunity 
arose. The big group could not tolerate the 
fact that ROSTE carried out a bank robbery. 
Therefore, they had come to the ROSTE 
camp with the intention of banning ROSTE. 
Because they were fully aware of ROSTE’s 
‘strength,’ a mere four people had shown up. 
Two of them carried modern guns.
Even at that juncture, ROSTE was ready to 
negotiate. But that was not the style of the 
big group. They had got ROSTE’s Central 
Committee to strip down to their underwear 
and had them kneel against the wall. They 
only spoke in obscenities. One ROSTE 
member was slapped hard on his cheek. His 
scream was heard throughout the village. 
Finally, the ROSTE Central Committee spoke 
in one voice:
“Brothers, ban us if you will, but do not 
disgrace us like this.”
Hearing this the fighters from the big group 
laughed out aloud. They also took pity on 
the plight of ROSTE. Right then, two loud 
explosions were heard. The two armed 
members of the big group collapsed one 
after the other, with gunshot wounds on their 
foreheads. Because the remaining two could 
not tell where the fire was coming from, they 
disappeared like a flash into the night. Such 
was their training. 
Kānthirājaṉ, having sniped from the darkness 
through the open window, entered the room 
with his gun drawn. Everyone in ROSTE 
realized that the big group would show up in a 
matter of minutes and annihilate ROSTE. No 
matter to which corner of this country ROSTE 
would run to, they knew that the big group 
would follow them and obliterate ROSTE.
Kānthirājaṉ told them to get dressed again, 
and they obeyed him without a word. Holding 
the gun, he led them out of the back entrance, 
and through the village fields. By the time 
they reached a coastal fisherfolk village, dawn 
was beginning to break. 
Kānthirājaṉ went to the fishermen to ask for 
help. He explained that they were a rebel 
group and that they needed a speedboat 
urgently. The fishermen came forward 
eagerly to help. Immediately a boat captain 
was found, and a speedboat with two fifty-
five horsepower engines was also readied. 
Carrying the ROSTE Central Committee 
and Kānthirājaṉ, the speedboat quickly 
disappeared over the horizon into the open 
sea. 
Only when the land receded from sight did 
the members of ROSTE breathe easy. The 
speedboat was galloping over the waves, 
spraying everyone wet. Kānthirājaṉ was busy 
trying to light a soaked beedi. One member of 
ROSTE asked, “Kandy, where are we going 
now?”
“We can head to Sivagaṅgai sāmi; I have a 
ton of relatives in that area. No problem,” said 
Kānthirājaṉ.
