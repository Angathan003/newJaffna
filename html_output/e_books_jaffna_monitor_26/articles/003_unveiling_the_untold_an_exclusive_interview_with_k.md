s we release the February 15th edition of the Jaffna Monitor, we 
are proud to bring our readers a range of powerful, thought-
provoking content that underscores our commitment to uncovering 
and sharing diverse perspectives and stories.
In this edition's spotlight is an exclusive interview with 
Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, better known as Colonel Karuna 
Amman. Recognized as a skilled military leader in the history of 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Karuna Amman's 
insights are pivotal for understanding a complex era in Sri Lanka's 
history. Our team's journey to Eastern Sri Lanka for this in-depth 
conversation reflects our dedication to bringing to light lesser-known 
narratives. This interview is particularly significant, marking one of 
the first occasions Karuna Amman spoke so openly. We look forward 
to sharing more from this enlightening conversation in future issues.
Our dedication to showcasing a range of narratives continues 
with a beautifully crafted translation of 'Kaṇṭi Vīraṉ' by renowned 
Sri Lankan Tamil writer Shobasakthi. Translated by the adept 
Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ, this work not only makes a celebrated piece 
accessible to more readers but also emphasizes the importance of 
valuing our rich linguistic heritage.
Additionally, we continue with Part 3 of the Anton Master interview 
and Part 4 of 'Mahathaya's Saga.' As with the previous instalments, 
we delve into stories that have remained untold, shedding light on 
aspects of the Sri Lankan Tamils' armed struggle.
For cricket fans, this edition doesn't disappoint, offering captivating 
cricket stories that provide a lighter complement to the intense 
political and historical narratives.
We believe that by understanding diverse perspectives, we foster a 
more inclusive, well-informed society. 
Thank you for joining us in this journey of exploration and reflection.
Warm regards,
