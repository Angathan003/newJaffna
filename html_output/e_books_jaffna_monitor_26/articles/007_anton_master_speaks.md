Dark Days in Jaffna: The Execution of EPRLF 
Members
During the period of the grenade attack on Kittu and 
subsequently, when Aruna executed members of rival 
militant groups, primarily EPRLF militants, I was in Jaffna. 
Even now, I remain uncertain about the exact number of 
people Aruna killed in the LTTE prison. However, I am 
aware that about 30 EPRLF members who were detained 
in Mannar were among the victims. These individuals had 
arrived from Rameswaram under the belief that the EPRLF 
was gaining strength in Mannar and that the LTTE was 
weakening. They came fully armed and were authorized 
to eliminate any captured LTTE members. Subsequently, 
they were transferred to the LTTE's prison in Jaffna, where, 
tragically, they all lost their lives due to Aruna's extreme 
and reprehensible actions.
"Prabhakaran's Discontent: 'Kittu Has Ruined 
Everything in Jaffna'"
When Prabhakaran returned to Sri Lanka from India, 
I was in Mannar. He immediately summoned me.

KT Sivakumar, also known as 
Anton Master, is a prominent 
early member of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and a close associate of leader 
Prabhakaran. He significantly 
contributed to the LTTE 
as a member of its Central 
Committee and as the founder 
and head of the Military Office 
(MO), enhancing the group's 
military effectiveness. Known 
for his reticence in media 
interactions, Sivakumar prefers 
'dialogues' over interviews. 
The following is a part of a 
series of dialogues I had with 
him, providing rare insights, 
which will be featured in the 
forthcoming issues.

Prabhakaran asked me to resume control 
of the Military Office and the Intelligence 
Division. After some discussion, we agreed to 
divide intelligence into two sections: I would 
lead military intelligence, and Ratha would 
oversee civilian intelligence. Upon first seeing 
Prabhakaran, he said to me, "Kittu has ruined 
everything in the Jaffna district." I wasn't 
surprised but told him not to involve me in 
Kittu's matters; he should handle them himself. 
Prabhakaran was extremely dissatisfied 
with Kittu but felt unable to act against him 
immediately.
Following Prabhakaran's visit, Kittu's men 
were gradually removed from the organization. 
Some left voluntarily, while others were asked 
to leave. Prabhakaran expressed satisfaction 
each time one of Kittu's men departed from 
the LTTE.
Confronting Kittu's False Allegations
Kittu had misjudged me on two occasions 
before. The first instance was due to his 
ignorance in the case of Shankar (the first 
LTTE member to die). The other was a false 
suspicion about me in 1986. I believe Kittu 
misunderstood my intentions when I came to 
Jaffna from India, thinking I was spying for 
Prabhakaran in 1986. This might have been 
because many long-time LTTE supporters 
shared their grievances about Kittu with me 
during my stay. They felt neglected by the 
movement and complained about Kittu's poor 
treatment. I told them that I couldn't do or 
say anything; my visit to Jaffna from India 
was personal and not to inquire about their 
complaints. I later discovered that while I was 
in Jaffna, Kittu had sent false information 
about me to Prabhakaran, claiming that I was 
interfering in his administration. I proved 
Kittu's allegations to be wrong.
Kittu's Feudal Tyranny
Kittu's conduct in Jaffna was reminiscent 
of a feudal lord. It was widely known that 
Colonel Kittu

he often resorted to verbal abuse and even 
physical violence against LTTE fighters. There 
were rumors that he had physically assaulted 
Thileepan, a prominent political leader in 
the LTTE. In the movement's early days, 
Prabhakaran's uncle, interestingly named 
Vellupillai, like Prabhakaran's father, played 
a pivotal role in safeguarding him. Despite 
this, Kittu displayed no respect towards 
Prabhakaran's uncle and mistreated him and 
attacked him. Prabhakaran informed me that 
his uncle was living in destitution in Jaffna and 
asked me to arrange the necessary facilities for 
him. Using LTTE contacts, I secured a house 
for him in Jaffna.
Attack on Kittu and Aruna's Rampage
A few months after Prabhakaran told me, 
'Kittu has destroyed everything,' an unknown 
assailant carried out a grenade attack on Kittu, 
resulting in the loss of one of his legs. As 
soon as I was informed about the attack on 
Kittu, my Military Office fighters cordoned 
off the area and conducted extensive search 
operations. When I arrived at the scene of 
Kittu's attack, I was confronted with the 
grim sight of his severed foot in a drain. 
We apprehended several suspects, yet those 
directly responsible for the attack on Kittu 
remained elusive. While I was overseeing 
the search operation around the area, a very 
reliable person came to me and shockingly 
informed me that Aruna, a senior LTTE 
member, had entered an LTTE prison and shot 
dead all EPRLF members. This news enraged 
me. Upon hearing this, Kittu's issue became 
secondary to me.
It was around 1 AM when I went directly to 
Prabhakaran's safe house. He was awake and 
was surprisingly calm, showing no signs of 
tension or concern about the attack on one of 
his key commanders. I argued to Prabhakaran 
that the killing of the EPRLF prisoners by 
Aruna was a grave mistake and that Aruna 
should be immediately arrested. Furthermore, 
I suggested that the LTTE should publicly 
apologize to the people for this incident and 
execute Aruna in a public place as punishment. 
Prabhakaran agreed with my persistent 
argument; Prabhakaran ordered the arrest of 
Aruna, demoted him, placed him under house 
arrest, and said we would decide Aruna's fate 
later.

Sometime later, Shankar, the head of the 
LTTE's Air Wing, met me for a discussion. 
Shankar's family, which included his 
siblings Siddharthan, Karan, and himself, 
were all part of the organization. I had 
personally recruited Siddharthan into 
the Tigers and held a special fondness 
for their family. During our meeting, 
Shankar mentioned that I had proposed 
to Prabhakaran that Aruna should be 
executed as punishment. However, he also 
cautioned me that there were plans by some 
individuals to assassinate me in retaliation 
if Aruna faced execution, advising me to 
stay vigilant.
Following the attack that resulted in Kittu 
losing his leg, significant changes were 
observed in both his demeanor and actions. 
He began to embrace my viewpoint that 
engaging in conflict with the Indian army 
and government was not a viable path to 
achieving Tamil Eelam. Subsequently, we 
both represented the LTTE in negotiations 
with the Research and Analysis Wing 
(RAW) of India.
