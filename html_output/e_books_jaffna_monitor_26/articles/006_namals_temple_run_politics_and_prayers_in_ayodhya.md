S
ri Lanka Podujana Peramuna 
(SLPP) MP and political heir 
of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal 
Rajapaksa, recently embarked 
on a politically motivated two-
day visit to Uttar Pradesh, India. 
The highlight of his journey 
was his attendance at the newly 
opened and politically charged 
Ayodhya Ram Temple, a visit 
that carries significant political 
resonance.
During his time in Uttar Pradesh, 
MP Namal Rajapaksa met with 
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 
and Deputy Chief Minister 
Brigesh Pathek in Lucknow, 
where 
he 
was 
reportedly 
well-received by Indian state 
leaders. Sources suggest that his 
journey had deeper intentions. 
His visit to the Ayodhya Ram 
Temple was not just a spiritual 
pilgrimage to seek blessings; it 
was also perceived as a gesture 
of seeking blessings from the 
Modi government.

a significant political signal to the Modi government. This 
action is seen as an attempt to seek blessings not only from 
Lord Ram but also from the Modi government, particularly at 
a time when presidential elections in Sri Lanka are anticipated 
later this year. Namal Rajapaksa is also mentioned as one of 
the potential candidates in the upcoming election.
This visit coincides with National People's Power (NPP) 
leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India upon an 
invitation from the Indian government. This suggests that 
India is taking the JVP-NPP seriously, in contrast to the 
perception of some Sri Lankans who view the JVP-NPP as a 
joke.
