inayagamoorthy Muralitharan, widely 
known as Colonel Karuna Amman, is 
often recognised as the most skilful military 
leader in the history of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)). He joined the LTTE 
in 1983, spurred by the ethnic violence of that 
year, and swiftly climbed the ranks to become 
one of the most trusted bodyguards of Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE. His career 
progressed rapidly, and he eventually assumed 
the role of the commander of the Eastern 
Province. Notably, in 1997, amidst Operation 
Jayasikurui (which translates to Operation 
Certain Victory in Sinhala), he was elevated to 
the position of the chief military commander of 
the LTTE's infantry divisions, with a command 
of approximately 40,000 fighters.
On July 26, 2004, Karuna Amman decisively 
broke away from the LTTE and sent 
approximately 7,000 eastern fighters back to 
their homes after making them relinquish 
their arms. This move, stemming from his 
allegations of the LTTE's neglect of the eastern 
Tamil community, marked a critical turning 
point in the conflict. The defeat of the LTTE 
in 2009 is attributed to several factors, but the 
departure of a highly skilled commander like 
Karuna Amman, along with his disbanding of a 
substantial number of fighters, is often cited as 
a key reason. This action not only significantly 
contributed to the LTTE's eventual downfall but 
also to the death of their leader, Prabhakaran, 
and played a crucial role in the conclusion of 
the 30-year-long Sri Lankan Civil War.
Many supporters of the LTTE and related 
media outlets label Karuna Amman as a traitor, 
accusing him of abandoning the Tamil Eelam 
movement. Conversely, numerous parents in 
the Eastern regions, whose children were sent 
home by Karuna Amman after laying down 
their weapons, view him as a hero who rescued 
their offspring from the severe conditions of 
the conflict. 
Jaffna Monitor embarked on a mission to 
understand the reasons behind Karuna 
Amman's separation from the LTTE, traveling 
to Murakkoddanchenai in Batticaloa for an in-
depth conversation with him. This exclusive 
interview offers a comprehensive overview of 
our dialogue with Karuna Amman.
We come from Jaffna, a region where 
many LTTE supporters perceive 
you as a traitor. Conversely, several 
former LTTE fighters and leaders 
we have spoken to hold you in high 
regard, some even describing you as 
the most capable and brilliant military 
commander in the LTTE's history. Can 
you shed light on the circumstances 
that led to your departure from the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE)? There are various theories 
and speculations â€“ what is your 
perspective on this matter?

the LTTE, and the Eastern fighters is important.'
He settled into a comfortable position, crossed his legs, 
and started to speak with a composed attitude.
'The LTTE has been a disciplined and strict organisation 
since its early days; there is no room for doubting this 
fact. Similarly, I continue to regard the leader of the LTTE, 
Prabhakaran, as a charismatic leader, and in this regard, 
there is also no room for argument. It was he who nurtured 
us. Had there been no Prabhakaran, the name Karuna 
Amman might have remained 
obscure. My respect for my leader, 
Prabhakaran, was, and still is, 
unwavering.
After the July 1983 riots, all 
movements, including the LTTE, 
experienced significant growth. 
During this time, my elder brother 
Regi and I chose to join the LTTE.

were the discipline and control within the LTTE 
organisation, coupled with Prabhakaran's 
excellent leadership skills and the aura he 
possessed.
After the 1983 riots, the Tigers comprised 
approximately 365 initial members. These 
members were split into three groups for 
training and sent to India. I belonged to the 
third group that underwent training there. 
Our training camp took place in Kolathur, 
located in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu, at a 
farmhouse owned by the Tamil Nadu politician 
'Kolathur' Mani.
The contribution of the then Indian Prime 
Minister, Indira Gandhi, in nurturing the 
LTTE was very significant. Similarly, the role of 
the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.G. 
Ramachandran (MGR), was also important. 
There was an excellent relationship between 
MGR and Prabhakaran. MGR, being a heroic 
figure, might have admired the heroic actions 
of Prabhakaran and the LTTE. 
From the training camps, Prabhakaran would 
personally select some of the outstanding 
performers for his personal team based on 
their physical fitness, behavior, and skills 
demonstrated during the camp. I was among 
the few selected from our third batch to be 
part of Prabhakaran's team. Immediately after 
completing the training, I was inducted into 
his team. Subsequently, I underwent various 
types of specialised training while being 
with him. Training specific to bodyguards 
and intelligence was provided. I received this 
training and became a part of the leader's 
personal bodyguard team.
Prabhakaran had a special fondness for the 
fighters from the Eastern Province. He often 
engaged in casual conversations, shared laughter, 
and played with them. He was particularly 
Karuna Amman engrossed in the latest edition of the Jaffna Monitor magazine.

fond of the Eastern slang of these fighters. 
During that period, Aruna was responsible for 
the Eastern region. Meanwhile, we were with 
Prabhakaran in Chennai, maintaining relations 
with the Indian government and coordinating 
resources.
In late 1985, when the Eastern commander, 
Aruna, came to Chennai, he was injured in 
an accident, leaving a vacancy in the East. 
Subsequently, Prabhakaran assigned me to go 
to Batticaloa. This was my first visit to Batticaloa 
after completing my training. At that time, 
Kumarappa was the commander of Batticaloa, 
and I worked under his command. During the 
Operation Liberation battle that began in May 
1987, Eastern commander Kumarappa went 
to Vadamarachchi with some Eastern fighters, 
and I joined them.
Subsequently, a strategic directive from 
Prabhakaran altered our operational course. 
While initially instructing Kumarappa to 
stay in Jaffna, Prabhakaran reassigned me 
to head back to Batticaloa, entrusting 
me with the expanded responsibility of 
district commander for both Batticaloa 
and Ampara. I officially embarked 
on this role at the onset of July 1987. 
During my tenure as commander, we 
instituted and executed numerous 
strategic and operational reforms. This 
period was also significant due to the 
implementation of the Indo-Sri 
Lanka Accord, a pivotal 
event in Sri Lankan 
Tamils' history.

During the tenure of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, 
Kumarappa and Pulenthiran were apprehended 
while in the process of transporting a shipment, 
which included not only weapons but also vital 
and confidential documents related to the 
LTTE. These documents held immense value, 
encompassing international communication 
records, details of commanders and area 
commanders, and other critical information. 
This apprehension took place as they were 
transferring these sensitive materials from the 
LTTE's military office in Chennai to Jaffna by 
boat.
The Sri Lankan government, recognising the 
strategic importance of the documents over 
the weapons, intensified its focus on this 
discovery. In a dramatic response to their 
capture, Kumarappa and Pulenthiran resorted 
to suicide by consuming cyanide. This act 
precipitated a significant escalation in the 
conflict between the Indian Army and the 
LTTE. At this critical juncture, while in close 
consultation with Prabhakaran, I followed his 
directives and travelled to Batticaloa. Upon 
my arrival, I found myself engaged in direct 
combat with the Indian forces.
Almost all commanders of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) harboured doubts 
about their ability to win a war against India. 
Key figures such as Pottu Amman, Soosai, and 
Nadesan cited injuries and eventually fled to 
India. At that time, Prabhakaran was in the 
Nithikaikulam forest in Mullaitivu.
As the situation escalated and grew increasingly 
complex, I received a crucial directive from 
Prabhakaran. The message was succinct and 
urgent: "The situation is deteriorating; gather 
whoever is available and proceed to Mullaitivu." 
In response, I mobilised alongside my brother 
Regi, leading a contingent of approximately 
150-200 Eastern fighters to Mullaitivu.
Upon reaching the area, we united with 
Prabhakaran in the Manal Aru forest to defend 
against the Indian Army strategically. Our 
foremost goal was safeguarding our leader, 
Prabhakaran, especially during Operation 
Checkmate, an IPKF operation targeting his 
capture or elimination. Together with Balraj, 
Commander Anbu, and other key members, 
we created a protective ring around our leader 
to ensure his safety.
Concurrently, the Vavuniya commander Jayam 
and others coordinated with Maththaiya on 
the Mallavi front. Adding to our strength, 
the former Jaffna military commander, Kittu, 
rejoined our ranks after returning from India. 
Our confrontation with the Indian forces was 
intense and determined as we sought to prevent 
their advance towards Prabhakaran.
Our efforts were singularly focused on 
safeguarding our leader, Prabhakaran. The 
battles were fierce, and our resolve unyielding. 
Despite our tenacious defence, we suffered 
significant losses, with many Eastern fighters 
falling during the conflict.
During the peak of the conflict with Indian 
forces, many LTTE fighters had been killed by 
the Indian troops; some left the movement, 
while others fled to India. The ones who 
remained to fight in the forests were our group 
in the Batticaloa district, Paduman's team 
in Trincomalee, and Anbu, Mahathaya, and 
Balraj also stood their ground and fought. 
Apart from these, no one else steadfastly 
supported Prabhakaran. Key figures like 
Pottu Amman, Soosai, and Banu fled to India 
without informing the leader. Ironically, those 
who initially left Prabhakaran later became 
prominent commanders of the Tigers.

But, they say Pottu Amman went to 
India for additional medical treatment 
after being injured...
Medical facilities were available in the forest 
where Prabhakaran was based. But did 
everyone who got injured really flee to India 
for treatment? On one occasion, Prabhakaran 
jokingly asked his commanders whether 
Semmalai, the initial point of his base, was 
nearer or if it was India.
Ok.. Then what happened? 
At a certain point, circumstances led to 
the withdrawal of Indian forces. Anton 
Balasingham was a key figure in diplomatically 
influencing this development. He was a skilled 
diplomat who adeptly handled numerous 
challenges on behalf of the LTTE, often saving 
the organisation from difficult situations. This 
is a fact I can confidently affirm to anyone.
When the Indian Army opted to withdraw, India's 
trust in the LTTE had eroded. Simultaneously, 
a robust relationship developed between the Sri 
Lankan government and the LTTE. Following 
this, the Sri Lankan government engineered 
circumstances that made it untenable for 
Indian forces to remain in Sri Lanka. Prior 
to the withdrawal of Indian forces, groups 
opposing the LTTE came together to establish 
the Tamil National Army (TNA), supported by 
India. The TNA was mainly stationed in the 
Eastern Province.
Following the withdrawal of the Indian Army, 
a significant conflict erupted between the TNA 
and the LTTE. LTTE managed to bring the 
Eastern Province under control during this 
conflict. It was, indeed, a horrific fratricide. 
I believe that the reason for our defeat in the 
Tamil Eelam struggle was the short-sightedness 
of the leaders of the liberation movements. All 
the militant groups were embroiled in conflict, 
tragically killing each other, allowing the enemy 
to witness our internal strife with amusement. 
The capture of the Eastern Province by the LTTE 
was a pyrrhic victory for the Tamil community. 
While the Tigers did not suffer a major loss, the

conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 
7,000 to 8,000 Tamil fighters from the TNA.
Looking back after many years, what 
are your thoughts now about the 
LTTE's elimination of members from 
other movements? Do you feel a 
sense of sadness and guilt about the 
fratricide committed by the LTTE?
 I believe that eliminating members of other 
movements was definitely not the right course 
of action; it was a grave mistake. We revered 
our leader, Prabhakaran, and never questioned 
his commands. We always acted solely on 
command all the time, often without awareness 
of the immediate or future consequences. 
We followed orders without hesitation; as 
youngsters, we did whatever we were ordered. 
Even if we had been ordered to commit suicide, 
we would have done it. That's how we were 
brought up in the movement. 
Was it brainwashing, Amman?
Undoubtedly, what we experienced was 
brainwashing. There was a strong allure towards 
our leader, Prabhakaran, accompanied by a 
systematic indoctrination that glorified dying 
for the Tamil race and leader. This mindset was 
instrumental in the establishment of the Black 
Jayanthan, the first Sea Black Tiger from the Eastern Province, alongside Prabhakaran.

Tigers. Back then, our understanding was 
limited. We regarded every order as if it were a 
divine command.
Please continue... 
In my view, the defeat of the liberation 
movements can be largely attributed to a lack of 
foresight among their leaders. The takeover of 
the Eastern Province from the Tamil National 
Army inflicted substantial losses on the Tamil 
community. The conflicts that began in Pottuvil

have been preventable. It was a situation 
where both sides were primarily focused on 
mutual destruction. Had there been better 
understanding and communication among 
the leaders of the Militant organisations, such 
losses might have been averted. Mistakes were 
made on both sides, with a notable fault lying 
with the LTTE. The leaders should have been 
more contemplative about their strategies. As 
for the fighters who were merely executing 
orders, how could they have recognised the 
error of their actions in the heat of the moment?
We did not fully grasp the severity of the 
situation when the LTTE eradicated Tamil 
Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) in 
1986, leading to the loss of hundreds of our 
Tamil brethren, nor did we comprehend it 
when Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation 
Front (EPRLF) suffered the same fate at the 
hands of the LTTE within the same year.
My firm belief is that all fighters who took up 
arms for the cause of a separate Tamil nation, 
irrespective of their group affiliations, deserve 
honour and recognition. Our enemies skillfully 
and systematically nurtured a sense of hatred 
among us, turning us into unwitting victims. 
The young men who embarked on a mission 
to fight for Tamil Eelam against the Sinhala 
chauvinist 
government 
tragically 
found 
themselves in a dire situation, compelled to 
surrender to the very forces they opposed. 
This is a shameful incident in the history of the 
Tamil struggle. 
What changes occurred within the 
LTTE following the departure of the 
Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF)?
Following the departure of the Indian 
Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), the number of 
individuals joining the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from the Eastern Province 
significantly surpassed those from the North. 
This was partly due to the disillusionment 
among Northern people caused by internal 
conflicts and killings within the movements. 
Many North parents were more inclined to 
send their children abroad for safety amid these 
circumstances. During this period, the Eastern 
Province faced severe military impositions and 
witnessed numerous massacres. As a result, 
many youths from the Eastern Province joined 
the LTTE.
In 1993, under my command, an elite infantry 
formation named the Jeyanthan Regiment, 
comprising highly skilled fighters from the 
Eastern Province was established. The motto 
of the Regiment, 'vq;Fk; nry;Nthk;. vjpYk; 
nty;Nthk;>" translates to 'We will go anywhere. 
We will win at anything.'
The Jeyanthan Regiment, named in honour 
of Jayanthan, the first Sea Black Tiger from 
the Eastern Province, was renowned for its 
exceptional combat capabilities. Strategically 
positioned in the North, the Regiment played 
a crucial role in ensuring the safety and 
protection of the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran. 
The fighters selected for this Regiment were 
frontline combatants, adept at safeguarding 
the leader under any circumstances. This 
Regiment was instrumental in executing several 
major operations. These included the Battle 
of Pooneryn (Operation Frog), Operation 
Unceasing Waves, targeting the Mullaitivu 
army camp, Operation Jayasikurui, and 
many more. These operations highlighted the 
Regiment's crucial role in the LTTE's military 
strategies and its significant contribution to the 
organisation's combat efforts.

the contributions of fighters from the Eastern 
Province in the northern battles. The fighters 
from the Eastern Province often met their end 
far from home, in the Northern Province, rather 
than in the East. There was a scenario in the 
East: when our regiments prepared to embark 
on their journey to the North, the parents of 
the fighters would come and wail in front of my 
camp, pleading with me not to send them to 
the North. The North was known as the 'killing 
fields' for the Eastern fighters.
After the fall of Jaffna to the Sri Lankan 
government forces in 1996, the LTTE relocated 
its primary operations base to the Vanni 
region. In a significant turn of events, the 
LTTE seized the Mullaitivu army camp in 
Operation Unceasing Waves. This camp was 
the only government-held base in Vanni and 
was captured just three months after the Jaffna 
Peninsula fell to government forces. This critical 
triumph in Operation Unceasing Waves, which 
resulted in the loss of hundreds of fighters from 
the Eastern Province, allowed the LTTE to gain 
complete control over the entire Vanni region.
While the Sri Lankan government forces 
maintained control over the northern tip of 
Jaffna, their supply lines to the south were 
heavily dependent on sea routes, as the land 
route, including the A9 or Kandy Road, from 
Vavuniya (under government control) to Jaffna, 
passed through LTTE-controlled territory in 
the Vanni. In a strategic move to secure this vital 
route, the Sri Lankan army initiated 'Operation 
Jayasikurui' on May 13, 1997. Had Jayasikurui 
succeeded and the A9 has been captured, it 
could have marked the end of the LTTE.
Before 'Operation Jayasikurui,' the Sri Lankan 
army had executed 'Operation Edibala' 
to take control of the main road from 
Vavuniya to Mannar. I recommended to our 
leader, Prabhakaran, that we avoid a direct 
counterattack. Instead, we adopted a strategy of 
feigning defence while strategically retreating, 
thus creating the illusion that we were incapable 
of a counterstrike. This approach tied up about 
10,000 army personnel in 'Operation Edibala.' 
The army's preoccupation with this route was 
a deliberate part of my plan to divert their 
attention to a less critical location. Prabhakaran 
agreed with this strategy. 
Once successful, it was apparent that the Sri 
Lankan army's next objective would be to 
capture the A9 highway. The control of the A9 
highway was critical. If the A9 highway were 
to be captured, the Vanni region would have 
easily fallen into the hands of the government 
forces, effectively making it impossible for the 
movement to continue. Indeed, during the final 
war, the moment the Sri Lankan army seized 
control of the main A9 highway marked the 
technical defeat of the LTTE.
Prabhakaran convened a meeting with all 
commanders to discuss the battle. During the 
meeting, the Jeyanthan Regiment proposed that 
Eastern Province forces should be tasked with 
offence rather than defence. The other LTTE 
commanders, frightened by the recent loss of 
Jaffna, readily accepted this suggestion despite 
the high risk of casualties and destruction it 
carried. Meanwhile, the Jeyanthan Regiment 
organised approximately 2,000 fighters from the 
Batticaloa district and 600 from the Trincomalee 
district to counter the Jayasikurui attack.
The defence was set up under Theepan's 
leadership. On the first day, Theepan's fighters 
lost one kilometre. On the second day, another 
kilometer was lost, and by the third day, 
Theepan's defense team had retreated a total 
of three kilometers. The Sri Lankan army 
advanced close to Puliyankulam.

Jeyanthan 
Regiment 
had 
not yet started the attack. 
Within 
the 
organisation, 
other commanders began 
criticising them, questioning 
when they would begin to 
attack. Instead of confronting 
the advancing army from the 
front, they circled around to 
the back and attacked from 
the side at Thandikulam. A 
fierce battle ensued. The army 
suffered significant losses, 
and the war was halted for 12 
days. The Thandikulam battle caused substantial 
damage to the army. The BBC described it as 
'LTTE entered the battlefield from the back, 
like an elephant entering a cornfield.'
The army began advancing again, and in 
response, the Jayanthan Regiment led another 
attack, inflicting heavy damage on them. This 
resulted in the battle stalling for 22 days. At 
this juncture, Prabhakaran began to believe 
we could win the war. Then, one day, he 
summoned us to Puliyankulam. Up to that 
point, our fighters had not seen the leader, and 
there was an intense desire among them to meet 
him. Remarkably, about 180 of our fighters had 
already fallen in the Jayasikurui battle without 
having seen him. Prabhakaran had invited all 
the commanders to this meeting, although the 
reason for his summons was unclear. He also 
brought delicious food for the fighters. 
Prabhakaran ascended the stage, and a sense of 
anticipation filled the air. With a commanding 
presence, he began to speak. In an unforeseen 
turn of events, he announced that I, Karuna 
Amman, was to be elevated to the prestigious 
role of the overall commander of all LTTE 
infantry divisions. The weight of his words hit 
me like a thunderbolt. Such a monumental 
appointment had never flickered through my 
mind, not even in the most ambitious corners 
of my imagination.
As Prabhakaran's words resonated through 
the meeting hall, I couldn't help but notice the 
air of dissent that began to brew subtly among 
some of the commanders. A few commanders 
present at the meeting, including Pottu 
Amman, the head of the LTTE's intelligence 
wing, visibly did not welcome this decision, as 
was evident from their facial expressions. I also 
somewhat realised that this appointment could 
lead me into unnecessary trouble. To be honest, 
I had no desire to take on this responsibility. 
From that day forward, key figures within the 
LTTE, like Pottu Amman, began to harbour 
resentment toward me.
Pottu Amman, armed with his keen strategic 
acumen, began to quietly yet effectively marshal 
support from other LTTE commanders 
against me. It was as though he was skillfully 
constructing a labyrinth of opposition around 
me and began digging a pit against me. 
To be continued..... 
Karuna Amman with his leader Prabhakaran.
