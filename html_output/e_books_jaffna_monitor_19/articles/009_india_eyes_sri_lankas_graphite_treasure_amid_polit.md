India Eyes Sri Lanka's Graphite 
Treasure Amid Political Turmoil
COLOMBO/NEW DELHI: In a move that could 
significantly impact the global mineral market, 
India is negotiating with Sri Lanka to acquire the 
country's coveted graphite mines, the Press Trust of 
India reported. The demand for graphite, essential 
for the anodes in lithium-ion batteries, is rising 
rapidly, making this acquisition strategically crucial. 
However, these talks are still in the early stages, with 
no additional details provided by sources.
Sri Lanka's graphite is renowned for its purity and 
quality, and it is considered among the best in the 
world. Last year, India identified graphite as one of its 
30 critical minerals, highlighting its importance. To 
secure these essential resources, Indian public sector 
giants like Coal India, NMDC, and ONGC Videsh Ltd 
(OVL) are actively scouting for mineral assets abroad. 
KABIL, a joint venture of Nalco, Hindustan Copper 
Ltd (HCL), and Mineral Exploration and Consultancy 
Ltd (MECL), is also on the hunt for international 
opportunities.
Political Drama Unfolds
These talks come amidst a political tempest in Sri 
Lanka. Former President and SLPP leader Mahinda 
Rajapaksa has publicly called for a halt to the 
government's divestiture drive, arguing that the 
current administration, an interim arrangement, lacks 
the popular mandate to sell state-owned assets. He 
suggested postponing such decisions until after the 
upcoming presidential election.
Despite Rajapaksa's objections, the government led 
by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is forging ahead. 
Rajapaksa's open letters, urging caution and delay, 
seem to have little effect on the ruling administration 
or his own party members.
JVP/NPP's Ambitions and Stance
Adding to the intrigue, the JVP/NPP has expressed 
ambitions to produce graphene from Sri Lanka's high-
quality graphite as a solution to the nation's foreign 
exchange problems, should they come to power. This 
raises questions about their stance on India's interest 
in acquiring these mines. Will they oppose India's 
efforts or turn a blind eye, given their recent softer 
stance post-India tour?
