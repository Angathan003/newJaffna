n an exceptionally rare achievement, 
Prasanthan, a standout student from Jaffna 
Hindu College known for his excellence in 
extracurricular activities, has been selected 
for the Faculty of Medicine at Uva Wellassa 
University. Initially chosen for the Molecular 
Biology program, Prasanthan secured his place 
in the medical faculty following a rigorous 
national-level selection interview conducted 
by the University Grants Commission for 
top achievers. His success is attributed to the 
additional Z-score points he earned through 
his extracurricular accomplishments, a unique 
factor in the university selection process.
The General Certificate of Education 
Advanced Level (GCE A/L) examination 
results are calculated using the Z-score 
obtained from three main subjects. However, 
the University Grants Commission (UGC) 
awards additional Z-score points to students 
who demonstrate significant achievements in 
extracurricular activities, providing them with 
enhanced opportunities. 
In 2022, 99 students from the Jaffna district 
were admitted to medical faculties, with two 
receiving special recognition.
Among them was Prasanthan, a student from

the 2022 biology section of Jaffna Hindu 
College. Prasanthan earned an opportunity 
to join the medical faculty at Uva Wellassa 
University based on this criterion. His A/L 
results were A2B, with a district rank of 113 
and a Z-score of 1.7822. Initially, he did not 
secure a medical faculty seat and was instead 
enrolled in the Molecular Biology degree 
program. However, thanks to his outstanding 
extracurricular achievements, he eventually 
secured his place in the medical faculty.
Jaffna Hindu College Principal Rathinam 
Senthilmaran highlighted Prasanthan's 
impressive extracurricular achievements in a 
detailed post. Prasanthan was deeply involved 
in both the Western and Eastern Music 
Bands, earning numerous certificates and 
participating in the student cadet program. He 
was also active in the Nature Club, excelled in 
quiz competitions, the Scout Movement, and 
served on the Student Leader Council.
His artistic talents were showcased through 
the Kavin Kalai Club (fine arts club), where 
he secured national-level awards in Carnatic 
Music Ensemble, Veena, and Mridangam. 
Additionally, he participated in regional-level 
Villupattu (an ancient form of musical story-
telling method)  and folk song competitions. In 
sports, Prasanthan was part of the basketball 
team, and competed in athletics and road 
races.
The selection interview focused on his high 
school achievements, but all accomplishments 
throughout his school career were considered. 
The school’s endorsement and his leadership 
activities played a significant role in his 
success.
This achievement underscores the importance 
of extracurricular activities in developing 
well-rounded individuals. Contrary to the 
common belief among Jaffna parents that 
extracurricular activities might hinder 
academic performance, Prasanthan’s case 
demonstrates how these activities can, in 
fact, pave the way for significant academic 
opportunities.
