n a scene reminiscent of Vadivelu's 
legendary comedy moment, "gLj;Nj 
tpl;lhd; kd;dh" ("He laid down, my Lord'') 
from the film Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikesi, 
where the comedy king Imsai Arasan 23rd 
Pulikesi dramatically prostrates himself before 
the enemy king Vallavaraayan to save his 
life and fend off an impending invasion, Sri 
Lankan Tamil lawmaker M.A. Sumanthiran 
has pulled off a similar political somersault 
that left everyone gobsmacked.  
Known for his vehement criticism of the LTTE 
and their violent tactics, Sumanthiran has long 
maintained that their methods only brought 
suffering to the Tamil community without

From Traitor to Toastmaster:

yielding any political gains. This stance has 
earned him the ire of pro-LTTE factions 
within the Tamil diaspora and local politics, 
who have branded him a traitor.
But in a twist worthy of the best comedy 
scripts, Sumanthiran recently made a jaw-
dropping verbal U-turn, showering praise 
on those "who took up arms on our behalf" 
during the Tamil liberation struggle. "While I 
personally believe that true political liberation 
can't be achieved at gunpoint, I've always said 
we can't judge the decisions of the Tamil youth 
who felt they had no other choice during times 
of oppression and military force," he declared, 
just ahead of the commemoration of the end 
of the brutal Sri Lankan civil war on May 
18, 2009. "Their commitment and sacrifices, 
made unselfishly, should be held in the highest 
regard," he added, adding a dramatic flair to 
his sudden change of tune.
His remarks came before making a rare 
appearance at the main commemoration 
ceremony at Mullivaikkal on May 18, the very 
site marking the end of the LTTE's armed 
struggle. Sumanthiran's sudden shift in tone 
is as surprising as Pulikesi's antics, leaving 
many wondering if this is another theatrical 
performance or a genuine change of heart. 
Either way, it certainly adds a dramatic twist to 
his political narrative!
With his unpredictable antics, Sumanthiran 
has turned the political stage into a circus 
of speculation. Is he trying to cozy up to 
the pro-Tiger factions, or is he genuinely 
acknowledging the tangled web of the Tamil 
struggle? Only time will spill the beans. For 
now, this twist has given political pundits 
enough material to last a lifetime.

A
laveddy, Jaffna – Alaveddy Sadananda 
Vidyalayam, a historic school with nearly 
a century of educational service, is on the 
verge of closing its doors. The recent departure 
of its last batch of fifth-grade students, who 
have transferred to other schools for middle 
education, has left the institution without 
any students. Currently, the principal and a 
solitary teacher are waiting in hopes of new 
enrollments, clinging to the possibility of a 
turnaround. Education officials say the school 
will be permanently shut down if no new 
admissions occur within the next few months.
This development marks a bittersweet chapter 
in the storied history of Alaveddy Sadananda 
Vidyalayam, a venerable institution that has 
been a cornerstone of primary education for 
countless residents of Alaveddy, one of the 
largest villages in Jaffna. 
Established nearly a century ago, this school 
once bustled with over 300 students in the 
mid-1980s, serving as a beacon of learning and 
community spirit. Throughout its illustrious

history, Alaveddy Sadananda Vidyalayam 
garnered numerous district, zonal, and 
divisional accolades, reflecting its commitment 
to educational excellence and its pivotal role in 
shaping young minds. 
Experts say that the situation at Alaveddy 
Sadananda Vidyalayam is emblematic of a 
broader issue affecting many rural schools. 
They pointed out that the concentration of 
resources and support in prestigious urban 
schools has left rural institutions struggling 
for survival. Alumni associations and local 
organizations often prioritize well-known 
schools, neglecting smaller, rural ones. Experts 
assert that sustainable development across 
all societal levels can only be achieved when 
educational resources are equitably distributed.
Post-war dynamics have funnelled resources 
into popular schools and prominent locations, 
pushing grassroots educational institutions like 
Alaveddy Sadananda Vidyalayam to the brink. 
Despite these challenges, Alaveddy Sadananda 
Vidyalayam still has hope. The school might 
be saved if neighbouring schools could share 
their resources and persuade some students 
to continue their education at Alaveddy 
Sadananda Vidyalayam.
They indicate that former students and 
the local community must unite to revive 
this institution. They pointed out that the 
successful revival of historic schools, such as 
the Varuthalaivilan American Mission School 
in Jaffna, through community support serves 
as a beacon of hope. By coming together, 
the community can ensure that Alaveddy 
Sadananda Vidyalayam continues to provide 
quality education for future generations.
The ancestors of Alaveddy built educational 
institutions with great effort and dreams 
for the future. The prosperous and thriving 
Alaveddy community, which produced many 
renowned scholars and professionals like 
the late V. Ponnambalam—a distinguished 
teacher, politician, and former Jaffna district 
secretary for the Communist Party—and the 
late Muhandiram T. Sathasiva Iyer, who served 
as the Director of Education for the combined 
Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, 
should inspire the current residents to take the 
lead in saving this school.
A united community effort is essential to 
ensure that Alaveddy Sadananda Vidyalayam 
survives and thrives once again. The residents 
of Alaveddy and neighbouring schools must 
collaborate with the Department of Education 
to achieve this goal.
In reality, the fate of Alaveddy Sadananda 
Vidyalayam rests in the hands of its 
community. With concerted efforts, this 
historic institution can be revived, continuing 
its legacy of educational excellence for future 
generations.
