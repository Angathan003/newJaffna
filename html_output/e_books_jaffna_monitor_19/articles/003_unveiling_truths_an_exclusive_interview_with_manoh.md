Unveiling Truths: An 
Exclusive Interview with 
Manoharan, Brother of 
LTTE Supremo
In this issue of the Jaffna Monitor, we have the privilege 
of presenting an exclusive and eye-opening interview 
with Manoharan, the elder brother of the LTTE supremo, 
Prabhakaran. Manoharan boldly exposes the rampant 
fraudulent activities being conducted under the guise of his 
late brother and his family.
With unwavering conviction, he calls upon LTTE 
supporters and sympathizers to confront the stark and 
undeniable truth: neither Prabhakaran nor any members 
of his immediate family survived the brutal conflict; they 
all perished in its cataclysmic final days. Manoharan asserts 
that it is imperative to put an end to these deceitful and 
exploitative practices, which prey on the emotional bonds 
that LTTE sympathizers have with their fallen leader and 
his family. It is time to dispel these illusions and face reality 
with integrity and honor.
In our relentless pursuit of truth and transparency, this 
issue also continues our in-depth interview with a United 
Nations worker who bore witness to the harrowing final 
stages of the Sri Lankan war. This account offers an 
unflinching and critical perspective on the catastrophic 
human toll exacted by the conflict. The interview also sheds 
light on the egregious war crimes committed by both the 
Sri Lankan government and the LTTE against innocent 
Tamil civilians. This unvarnished narrative is essential for 
understanding the multifaceted tragedy that unfolded.
We are immensely pleased to announce that from this 
issue onward, we will feature the writings of the esteemed 
Sri Lankan Tamil author Sarawanan Komathi Nadarasa. 
Our dedicated team has meticulously translated his 
insightful work, ensuring his eloquent voice resonates with
