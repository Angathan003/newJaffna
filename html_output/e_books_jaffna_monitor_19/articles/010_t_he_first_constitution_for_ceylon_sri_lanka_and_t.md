T
he first constitution for Ceylon (Sri Lanka) 
and the political framework for governing 
the country were established in 1833 through 
the Colebrooke-Cameron reforms. The 
Legislative Council created under these 
reforms consisted of 15 members: 9 official 
members and 6 unofficial members. Among 
the 6 unofficial members were 3 Europeans, 1 
Sinhalese, 1 Tamil, and 1 Burgher.
Based on this structure, the first Tamil 
representative in Sri Lanka's Legislative 
Council was Arumugampillai Coomaraswamy, 
the first Sinhalese member was J.G. Philipsz 
Panditharatne, and the first Burgher member 
was J.C. Hillebrandt.
The Coomaraswamy family subsequently 
became a longstanding force in representing 
Tamils. Following Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy, the family lineage 
continued to produce representatives: 
Ethirmannasingham, Arumugampillai 
Coomaraswamy (from May 30, 1835, 
until his death on November 7, 1836), 
Ethirmannasingham (1846-1861), Muthu 
Coomaraswamy (1861 until his death in 1879), 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan (1879-1930), 
Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy (1892-1898), 
and Ponnambalam Arunachalam (1912-1913), 
among others.1
Among them, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan 
had a political career spanning nearly half a 
century. However, his younger brother, Sir 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam, is revered even 
more highly. Arunachalam, who was born 
after Ramanathan but passed away before him, 
served as a Legislative Council representative 
for only one year. Despite this short tenure, his 
role as a civil servant and his contributions to 
politics and trade unions were significant.
In the Sinhalese context, members of the 
"Govigama" caste, a Sinhalese Vellala/farming 
caste, have dominated the Legislative Council 
from the beginning. Similar to how the 
Vellala Coomaraswamy family continuously 
held significant positions from the Tamil 
community, the Sinhalese Govigama families 
of Bandaranaike and Obeyesekere have also 
been prominent.
Notable representatives from these families 
include:
H. Dias (1861-1865)
James Alwis (1875-1878)
J.P. Obeyesekere (1878-1881)
A.L. de Alwis (1881-1888)
De Alwis Seneviratne (1888-1900)
S.C. Obeyesekere (1900-1911)
One exception to this pattern was E.H. 
Dehigama, who served from 1865 to 1875.2

Tamil Vellala and Sinhalese Govigama 
Combination
In the later period, during the 1911 election for 
the Legislative Council, Marcus Fernando, who 
belonged to the Karava caste, contested against 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan. The elite 
Sinhalese Govigama community was unwilling 
to accept a member of the Karava caste as their 
representative. Consequently, they ensured the 
defeat of Marcus Fernando and secured the 
victory of Ponnambalam Ramanathan, who 
belonged to the higher Vellala caste.
At that time, the Sinhalese-Tamil divide 
was not a significant factor. The choice was 
between "Jaffna x Saiva x Tamil x Vellala x 
Educated Elite" Ponnambalam Ramanathan 
and "Colombo x Buddhist x Sinhalese x Karava 
x Educated Elite" Marcus Fernando. In this 
context, Ponnambalam Ramanathan's caste 
was the deciding factor in his selection.
Given this background, Dr. W.G. Rockwood 
stands out as the first Tamil representative to 
break the monopoly of the Vellala-Govigama 
caste dominance. It's also worth noting that 
in the Sinhalese context, it wasn't until 1912 
that someone outside the Govigama caste was 
chosen.3
Some might argue that Simon Cassie Chetty, 
who served as a Tamil representative from 
1838 to 1845, is an exception. However, the 
Chetty community has always been regarded 
as equivalent to the Vellala caste within Sri 
Lanka's caste hierarchy.
There was a time when Tamils and Muslims 
had a single representative, as Muslims were 
also considered Tamils. From August 28, 
1879, to December 15, 1892, Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan served as the unofficial Tamil 
representative in the Legislative Council. At 
the request of the government, Ramanathan 
was appointed Solicitor General in 1892, which 
made his position in the Legislative Council 
vacant.
His brother, Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy, 
was recommended for the position and was 
appointed as the unofficial representative in 
the Legislative Council on February 4, 1893. 
This appointment was made by Arthur Elibank 
Havelock. Following Havelock, the next 
Governor was Ridgeway.
Who is Ridgeway?
After Governor Arthur Havelock, Sir Joseph 
West Ridgeway became the Governor of 
Ceylon (Sri Lanka). He had a military 
background and served as the British 
government's representative at Tsar Peter's 
court in Russia, where he signed agreements.

He also served as a resident at the Sultan's 
palace in Morocco, Africa. Ridgeway requested 
the position of Governor of Ceylon and 
arrived on the island with prior knowledge and 
information gathered from former governors 
of Ceylon.
Ridgeway arrived in Ceylon in November 
1895, toured the island, and engaged closely 
with the locals, gaining direct experience. It 
is said that he operated without bias, treating 
all residents equally, regardless of ethnic, 
religious, or linguistic differences. Due to the 
favorable financial state left by the previous 
Governor, Ridgeway was able to initiate 
several development projects in Ceylon, 
including tea plantations, railway construction, 
road building, healthcare improvements, 
educational reforms, and the restructuring of 
the Survey Department.
This period saw significant advancements in 
various sectors. During this time, Ananda 
Coomaraswamy provided invaluable service 
as the head of the Department of Mineralogy. 
The British government agreed to bear half 
the cost of developing the Colombo port. 
Transportation improvements were notable, 
with the introduction of electric trams and 
the importation of the first motor cars. This 
era also marked the birth of S. W. R. D. 
Bandaranaike, a future Prime Minister of Sri 
Lanka, whose father named him Solomon 
West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike in honor of 
the Governor.4
During Ridgeway's tenure, the government 
purchased the building that now serves as the 
Prime Minister's official residence, Temple 
Trees. There had been widespread illegal 
deforestation and land acquisition by wealthy 
individuals and officials. Consequently, in 
1840, a law was enacted declaring forests, 
barren lands, and lands with less than five 
years of ownership as government property. 
A special officer was appointed to record land 
ownership under this law.
This led to the perception that the British 
colonial administration was seizing local lands, 
resulting in native uprisings and debates in 
the British Parliament. However, Governor 
Ridgeway remained steadfast, asserting that 
the law was enacted for the prosperity of the 
people of Ceylon and would benefit future 
generations. He clarified that those claiming 
ownership needed to present valid documents 
to prove their claims. This law also allowed 
the allocation of land for coffee cultivation 
and facilitated the settlement of Indian Tamil 
laborers.
The Sinhalese community accused 
Ridgeway of distributing land to Indian 
Tamils. During the rise of native opposition 
against Ridgeway, one of his critics was

Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy, who 
denounced the Governor's approach as that of 
a "plunderer." When Coomaraswamy's term 
as a representative ended, Governor Ridgeway 
decided not to reappoint him.
However, a large meeting led by Rockwood 
was held to demand Coomaraswamy's 
reappointment as the Tamil representative. 
Some suggested appointing Swaminathan, 
Britto's son-in-law, instead.
Arumuga Navalar in the Britto vs. 
Ramanathan Contest
When Ramanathan was first appointed to the 
Legislative Council in 1879, his competitor 
for the seat was Britto. Britto, a prominent 
and influential figure from the Jaffna Tamil 
Christian Chetty community, was defeated 
by Ponnambalam Ramanathan, who came 
from a Jaffna Tamil Saiva Vellala background. 
Arumuga Navalar put in significant effort 
to ensure Ramanathan's victory over Britto. 
Interestingly, both Ramanathan and Britto 
were married to daughters of the wealthy E. 
Nannithamby from Manipay, Jaffna.
Prabhakaran's great-grandfather, Thirumeniar 
Venkatasalam Pillai from Valvettithurai, 
supported Britto's political aspirations. 
However, Arumuga Navalar was determined to 
bring a Saiva Vellala representative into politics 
and fully supported Ramanathan. If this event 
had not occurred, the political history of Sri 
Lanka might have taken a different turn.5
Governor Ridgeway ended the monopoly 
of caste-based representation by secretly 
inviting Rockwood to his office in early 
1898, persuading him to become the Tamil 
representative. Rockwood succeeded Mudaliar 
Ponnambalam Coomaraswamy, who had 
served as the Tamil representative until 1898. 
On March 14, 1898,6 Governor Sir Joseph 
West Ridgeway appointed Rockwood as the 
Tamil representative to the Legislative Council 
for a five-year term from March 13, 1898, to 
March 13, 1903. This appointment marked the 
end of the family-dominant and caste-based 
monopoly.7 Rockwood was reappointed on 
March 15, 1903.
What Does Ponnambalam Ramanathan 
Say?
Rockwood's appointment caused Ramanathan 
significant disappointment. M. Vaithilingam, 
who wrote Ponnambalam Ramanathan's 
biography, recorded this incident. Ramanathan 
expressed his discontent over the Governor's 
decision to appoint Rockwood instead of 
extending Mudaliar Coomaraswamy's term.
Ramanathan expressed his discontent

Government of Ceylon. On the expiry of 
the term of office of that Member of Council 
he was my elder brother the Tamil people 
held a mammoth meeting at the Town Hall 
of Colombo to consider who would be a 
competent successor to that Member Mr. 
Coomaraswamy who was too outspoken for 
the Government. The late Dr. Rockwood, 
a man in whom the whole of the European 
Community had great confidence, and who 
was himself a Tamil man, was the Chairman 
of the meeting and there was a unanimous 
resolution passed in which the Chairman 
himself joined, that they should again submit 
for nomination the name of Coomaraswamy 
who had acted so independently during 
his termof five years in the Legislative 
Council. Then Governor Ridgeway took 
this extraordinary step. He did not want Mr. 
Coomaraswamy back again in Council. So he 
wrote a private letter to Dr. Rockwood and 
asked him whether he would accept the Seat. 
And Dr. Rockwood, without communicating 
with Mr. Coomaraswamy or any other 
personwho took part in the meeting, accepted 
the offer. It was thus realized that no reliance 
could be placed upon the Governor for doing 
the right thing at the proper time when the 
system of nomination prevailed.."8
However, in the editorial of the Jaffna College 
Miscellany published in 1909, it was noted that 
Ramanathan congratulated Rockwood on his 
appointment:
"The Tamil community could not have thought 
of anyone who commanded the respect and 
admiration of people of all races and classes, as 
well as the high regard of various communities, 
like Dr. Rockwood."
This statement was recorded as part of 
Ramanathan's speech at the meeting held for 
his brother Coomaraswamy's re-election.9
Governor Stubbs later issued a report 
expressing the colonial administration's 
dissatisfaction with this appointment, stating 
that the decision prevented a powerful family 
from continuing its dominance (CO. 723 
of March 29, 1909, Stubbs minute). M.U. 
de Silva also referenced this incident in his 
article on the role of caste in British colonial 
appointments in Sri Lanka during the 19th 
century.10
It's worth noting that Rockwood came from 
the Koviyar community, which was once 
treated as a servile caste in Jaffna's caste 
system.
Rockwood
William Gabriel Rockwood was born on 
March 13, 1843, in Alaveddy, Jaffna. He 
was the second son of Chinnathambi Elisa 
Rockwood, the Sub-Collector of Customs 
at Kankesanthurai. Rockwood received his 
early education at Vembadi Boys' School 
in Jaffna and later attended Presidency 
College in Chennai, where he completed 
his matriculation. He then pursued medical

studies at Madras Medical College, graduating 
with first-class honors.
Upon returning to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), 
Rockwood was appointed as a medical officer 
in Puttalam. During the cholera outbreak in 
Jaffna in 1866-67, he worked on special duty. 
Although he returned to Puttalam for his 
medical duties, he went back to Jaffna during 
the rapid spread of cholera in 1875 and worked 
intensively on eradication efforts, saving many 
lives in the medical facilities there.11 After 
serving in several medical institutions, he 
was appointed as a surgeon at the Colombo 
General Hospital in 1878 and later became 
a lecturer in surgery at the Ceylon Medical 
College.
Rockwood was recognized as a skilled and 
renowned surgeon, a competent doctor, and, 
later, a capable politician. During his tenure, he 
played a significant role in advocating for the 
railway service to the North and Chilaw and 
was instrumental in establishing the railway 
line to the North.12
Two of Rockwood's daughters married 
prominent professionals: one to lawyer 
Saravanamuthu and the other to accountant S. 
Kumaraswamy. In honor of Rockwood, a hall 
at the large hospital in Colombo was named 
"Rockwood Hall," which was inaugurated by 
the then-Governor Sir Henry McCallum on 
April 16, 1912. Rockwood had served as the 
chief surgeon at this hospital for about 20 
years.13
Rockwood was highly respected among 
Europeans not only as a doctor but also as an 
excellent surgeon. Notable comments from 
two famous surgeons highlight his reputation: 
Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson called him the best 
surgeon in the East, and Sir Frederick Treves, 
an expert on tropical diseases, remarked that 
it would have been beneficial to have Dr. 
Rockwood from Ceylon during a challenging 
surgery.
Rockwood had the opportunity to provide 
medical advice to the King of England during 
the coronation ceremony and made two trips 
to England. During these visits, he became a 
member of the Royal College of Surgeons and 
the Royal College of Physicians.
In 1904, he donated 1,000 rupees to Jaffna 
College to establish a scholarship fund. He 
was also among the first eight philanthropists 
to fund the establishment of the first medical 
college in Ceylon.14 Financially well-off, 
Rockwood was also a plantation owner. By 
1917, the Rockwood family was listed among 
the wealthiest in Ceylon, owning over a 
thousand acres of coconut plantations.15
During his extended term starting on July 
9, 1903, Rockwood traveled to England, and 
W.N. Aserappa was temporarily appointed 
to his position on April 19, 1904. In January 
1906, Rockwood resigned from the Legislative 
Council due to health reasons, and A. 
Kanagasabai, another Vellala, was appointed in 
his place on February 4.

Rockwood retired from medical, social, 
and political activities due to a stroke in 
1906 and passed away on March 27, 1909, 
at the age of 66.16 Dr. W.G. Rockwood 
married Muthamma, the daughter of Chinna 
Mudaliar Kathiraverpillai of Moolai, Jaffna 
(1857-1925).17 She was well known for her 
involvement in all her husband's social 
activities and was a respected figure in her own 
right. She passed away on August 29, 1925.
Ramanathan
The Coomaraswamy family has been a 
dominant force in Sri Lankan Tamil political 
history for over one and a half centuries. 
Among this lineage, Sir Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan stands out as a key figure who 
maintained conservative religious politics. 
By the end of his life, he had become a 
representative of orthodox, traditional, high-
caste, educated, elite male dominance, though 
his early roles were different.
In 1921, at the age of 70, Ramanathan was 
knighted by the British government. He 
believed that reform, not independence, 
was sufficient for the natives. It is not an 
exaggeration to say that he was a product 
of the Arumuga Navalar and the Saiva 
Renaissance. Appointed to the Legislative 
Council of Ceylon for the first time in 1879 at 
the age of 28, he remained active in politics for 
50 years until his death.18
Ramanathan did not want political power in 
the hands of ordinary people. He believed it 
should rest only with educated, high-class, 
high-caste men. Based on this principle, he 
openly opposed universal suffrage during the 
Donoughmore Commission inquiries.
During his testimony on December 20, 
1927 (Evidence No. 101), he said: "Leave 
our women alone in their role. It is not for 
you to understand why they are meant to 
be subordinate in this world by God's will. 
A woman's entire life and focus should be 
at home. There is no world beyond that for 
them. Do not allow them to go beyond their 
household duties."

He reiterated these views during debates in the 
Legislative Council: "Why are they teaching us 
this rotten philosophy? Why are they forcing 
it down our throats?" he said during the 
debate on the Donoughmore Constitution on 
November 8, 1928.
He did not live to see the implementation 
of the Donoughmore scheme and universal 
suffrage, as he passed away in 1930, two years 
after the debate.
Is there anything from this conversation you'd 
like me to remember for the future?
While the research books and articles by 
Ramanathan are still praised by many scholars 
today, some have also sparked controversy. 
One of the most notable is his essay titled 
"Ethnology of the Moors." He presented 
this research essay publicly at the Ceylon 
Legislative Council in 1885 and at the Royal 
Asiatic Society - Ceylon branch in 1888. In 
it, he explained that the Moors of Sri Lanka 
are ethnically Tamils and religiously Muslims. 
He venomously argued in his essay that the 
eastern Muslim community originated from 
traders who married "low" caste people. Given 
that he emerged from the political milieu 
of Arumuga Navalar's camp, such venom is 
unsurprising.
These views caused significant controversy 
at the time. The Muslim community strongly 
condemned his data regarding Muslims. 
Buddhist, Saiva and Islamic revivals were 
occurring in Sri Lanka roughly during this 
same period. Muslim scholars who could 
respond to Ramanathan's views also grew 
during that time.
When the government announced in 1929 that 
all students in schools should be given equal 
seating regardless of race, religion, caste, or 
nationality, enraged Vellalars set fire to fifteen 
schools. In 1930, when the Kopay Teachers' 
Training College admitted lower-caste students 
for the first time and provided equal seating 
with Vellalar students, Sir Ponnambalam 
Ramanathan appealed to the Governor against 
it. That same year, he passed away.
How could Ramanathan, who had such a 
dominating priestly mentality, tolerate a non-
Vellalar person attaining political power? 
Moreover, how could he bear it when a person 
from a slave caste (Kovia) was appointed to 
his position after removing his elder brother 
from that place? He perceived it as a tarnish 
on his high-class, high-caste influence. 
Although Rockwood was well-educated and 
not inferior to Ramanathan in terms of class, 
he still experienced caste-related pressures and 
inconveniences in his political representation. 
Without the support of Governor Ridgeway, 
how long might the Tamil community have 
had to wait for the representation of a non-
Vellalar?
We must understand the politics behind why 
not a single line about Rockwood has appeared 
in Tamil literature so far. How did Rockwood 
disappear from the list of achievers in Jaffna? 
Why was he hidden? We do not need profound 
knowledge to understand the reasons. Anyone 
with a basic understanding of the caste 
hegemony in Jaffna can easily grasp it. Apart 
from the caste-based manipulation of Jaffna's 
hegemonic politics, what else can we blame for 
the absence of any record about Rockwood in 
Tamil?

A 
little but intriguing moment from the glory days of Sri Lankan 
cricket. In this article, we are going to explore a captivating moment 
from the golden days of Sri Lankan cricket, focusing on an unexpected 
hero who turned the tide in a crucial match. This isn't just a tale of 
celebrated stars but rather a story of how one player's moment of 
brilliance can redefine the outcome of a game.
Prior to the 2007 World Cup, Sri Lanka faced India in a four-match 
series. The first game was washed out, and the second took place in 
Rajkot. Led by a brilliant century from Sangakkara and the skill of their 
bowlers, Sri Lanka was hanging on by the skin of their teeth in the game.

At this time, Dhoni had not yet become the 
celebrated finisher he would eventually be. 
However, Sri Lanka was well aware of his 
might, having experienced the pain of his 
unbeaten 183* just 18 months earlier. With 
11 runs needed off the last over, it was Dhoni 
against Jayasuriya, often overlooked as one 
of Sri Lanka's better death bowlers. Sanath's 
brilliant yorkers restricted India to just one run 
from the first three balls. It came down to 10 
runs needed off the last three balls—Dhoni vs. 
Jayasuriya.
Here's the twist: this isn't about Sanath or 
Dhoni but Maharoof. You might wonder 
how. Here's the story. As Sanath delivered a 
full-length delivery as the fourth ball, Dhoni 
stepped down the track and hit it hard to long 
on. Maharoof, positioned at long-on, wasn't 
the best fielder. He dived over a difficult but 
manageable stop, conceding a boundary. The 
equation was now six runs needed off two 
balls.
As often happens in such moments, in front of 
thousands of spectators, skipper Mahela pulled 
Maharoof into the circle—a humiliation for 
any fielder. Now, Maharoof was in the covers. 
But the story wouldn't end there.
Next delivery, Sanath bowled another full-
length delivery outside off. Dhoni tried to 
smash the ball out of the park to seal the game. 
The ball caught the leading edge and flew 
above the circle, heading towards no man's 
land. Tharanga, a fresher on the side, was 
charging in from sweeper cover. Maharoof ran

backward at full speed. A nasty collision seemed 
imminent, which would have been a case of 
going from bad to worse for Maharoof. Just 
when it seemed like the worst might happen, 
magic occurred. Tharanga and Maharoof were 
almost on top of one another, but in the blink 
of an eye, Maharoof pulled off a blinder. Magic 
had happened for Maharoof. Redemption at its 
best, or perhaps just pure relief.
The fortunes fluctuated dramatically from 
almost losing the game for Sri Lanka to winning 
it by catching Dhoni. Rightly so, Maharoof 
ended on the right side. He had already had a 
good game with the bat and two early wickets; 
it would have been cruel to end up on the losing 
side.
At times, it all comes down to one moment. 
What you do at that moment can define 
everything. On that day, it was a joyous ending 
for Maharoof.
This picture says it all, capturing that 
memorable moment from one of the better 
games Sri Lanka has played.

A Train Journey
T
he train was speeding along noisily. Inside, a 
teeming crowd bustled. I stood at the open door of 
the carriage I was traveling in and surveyed the scenes 
outside. The railway line was hugging the coast. The 
train moved ahead, occasionally letting out a long sigh. 
My eyes scanned the coast. My mind strayed from the 
actual scenes that were rushing past, and dwelled on 
imaginary scenes, forming a tapestry.
Pockets of people sat on the blackstone benches that 
lined the shore, busily chatting with one another. 
Officials wearing trousers, ordinary workers wearing 
sarongs, fishermen wearing only loincloths, women,

old men, young men, damsels, crones, and 
toddlers formed knots after knots of people, 
and immersed themselves in conversations. 
Humans engage in conversation from the day 
they are born. Even Adam and Eve must have 
conversed. I wondered when this conversation 
would end.
It seemed to me that many of them were 
laughing, some were talking aloud excitedly, 
others were moaning weakly from illnesses, 
while yet others were crying. All the different 
types of humanity were represented there.
The train heaved a long sigh and sped along. 
As if to announce an approaching station, it 
blared out a high-pitched wail. Eventually, 
accompanied by a series of jolts, moans, and

squeaks, it came to a halt at a station. I turned 
my eyes from the outside towards the inside 
of the train. A middle-aged man and a young 
twenty something woman in a red sari got off 
the train, almost bumping into me. She had 
the power to instantly attract attention. Many 
others got off from my carriage, too. But my 
mind was fixated on that woman. She and 
the man rushed towards the south, mingling 
among the sea of heads on the platform, and 
disappeared from sight.
I was lost in thought, thinking about her. 
My eyes stared blankly at the platform. The 
hawkers’ calls of vadai.. vadai.. soda, gently 
rapped on the wall of my consciousness.
The train sounded its horn, getting ready to 
leave. I peeked outside. The guard waved the 
green flag from the carriage at the northern 
end of the train. The train started with a jolt 
and began crawling slowly. I yearned to catch 
a glimpse of the woman somewhere on the 
platform. The crawling train gradually sped 
up to a steady trot. I kept looking outside until 
the platform disappeared from sight. Finally, 
with a sigh, I turned my gaze inside the 
carriage. The crowd had dissipated. Everyone 
but me had a seat. I looked around to see if I 
could find an empty seat.
Suddenly I saw a pair of eyes looking at me 
inquisitively. When she saw me returning 
her gaze, she blushed and cast her eyes 
downwards. Her face was round like the 
moon. She was a little paler than a lemon. 
She wore three thin lines of vibhūti on her 
forehead. A small black poṭṭu adorned the 
center of her forehead. She had parted her 
hair in the middle in a straight line and wore 
it in a plait held by a red ribbon. She wore a 
white pāvādai long skirt and a green blouse 
with a flower pattern. In her arms that looked 
like banana stems, she held two books and a 
notebook. I tried to read the title of the book. 
‘Bharathi and Shelly.’ She must be a literature 
lover, I thought. My eyes refused to move away 
from her.
She lifted her eyes up once again, only to cast 
them down when she noticed that I was still 
looking at her.
With a smile, I turned my gaze towards the 
outside. I marveled at my own psyche. Just a 
little while ago, I was infatuated by a woman,

yearning to see her again. But now, I want to 
look at a different woman, admire her beauty 
inch-by-inch, and struggle to take my eyes off 
of her.
My mind urged me to look at her again.
I resolved to suppress this urge, forcing my 
mind away from thinking about her.
The sun’s gentle evening glow pervaded the 
landscape. The sea water shimmered in the 
sun. The white waves reflected the sunlight 
directly onto my face. At a distance, the hazy 
pale dot of a ship was hurrying away. Nearer to 
the shore, on the northwest side, a sailboat was 
gently swaying in the wind. Two people on the 
boat appeared as two tiny dots. A couple stood 
by the railway tracks looking at the passing 
train. A three-year old boy, standing between 
them, cackled and waved.
With a jolt, the train came to a halt at the next 
station.
She, who was regarding me from the corner of 
her eye, smiled and turned to look at the sky.
I suppressed, with difficulty, the urge to laugh 
and looked for a seat. I resolved to speak to 
her.
As luck would have it, right next to her in 
her seat, there was just enough space for one 
person. She kept staring at the sky. I hesitantly 
walked towards her and sat down next to her.
She turned to look at me nonchalantly, as if 
she was in fact expecting me to sit down next 
to her! Her eyes shone with an intoxicating 
beauty. She squirmed a little in her seat as if 
she could not bear my body brushing against 
hers. She also seemed very anxious to tell me 
something.
The train started again with another jolt. She 
was gazing outside through the window as if 
she was ignoring me. With a sigh, I turned 
my eyes to scan the interior of the carriage. 
She turned to look at me as if my sigh had 
interrupted her reverie. I pretended not 
to notice her glance and stared intently at 
something. I could sense through the corner 
of my eye that she was sizing me up from head

to toe. I continued to ignore her.
A baby started to scream. The young mother 
who was sitting opposite to me tried to hold 
the baby tightly to her chest, attempting to 
make the baby fall asleep. The baby’s cry 
subsided in the comfort of its mother’s bosom. 
I turned my attention to the carriage. It was 
now a little more crowded. A couple of people 
must have boarded the train at the last station. 
A young man was standing where I used to 
stand, immersed in some imagined stories. 
Next to him, a fisherman had upended his 
empty basket and was sitting on it. A boy 
selling lottery tickets was holding a board with 
lottery tickets hanging from it and regarded 
the seashore with interest. Beyond him a 
bearded old man was staring at me and the 
young woman sitting next to me. Some beggar 
woman was doing her rounds while singing a 
new film song. She came to stand before me 
and thrust her hand towards me for money 
while continuing to sing.
I groped around in my pocket. I could not 
find anything smaller than a fifty-cent coin. 
The young woman deftly opened the black 
handbag next to her, took out a ten-cent coin 
and put it on the beggar’s palm. Until then, I 
had not noticed that she had a handbag.
The beggar looked at me. I signaled her to go 
away.’ I was embarrassed to do this while the 
young woman was still watching me. But I 
did not have any other option. Some romeos 
would give up anything to be able to impress 
women. But I could not part with a fifty-cent 
coin as casually as they would have.
I am not sure what she thought of this 
interaction. She turned to look at me. I met 
her gaze. She cast her eyes downwards. She 
did not have the same flourish on her face as 
before. The beggar moved on and started her 
lament once again. I silently cursed the beggar.
The train paused at the next station and 
started again. The beggar woman and the 
lottery-ticket boy had disembarked. The 
young woman with the baby was leaning her 
head onto the seat back while still holding the 
baby tight. The fisherman with the basket was 
mumbling a popular Sinhala song. The young 
man at the door was immersed in some deep 
thought. The bearded old man was fast asleep.

I looked at the young woman. She was lost 
in the scenes fleeting past outside. Her 
beautiful hands tightly clutched her books and 
notebook. Her handbag nestled among them.
The train left the coast and turned inland. It 
was zipping along on the railway track that 
snaked through beautiful verdant paddy fields. 
In the dimming sunlight, the scene glittered 
with a particularly beautiful elegance. I, like 
her, kept looking at this stunning natural 
beauty.
The train rumbled noisily over a river bridge. 
There were two women bathing on the 
riverbank. Next to the path lay lavish green 
paddy fields and banana plantations.
Tired of looking at nature, I turned my gaze 
towards her. There was no change in her. She 
kept staring outside.
“May I borrow this book?” I asked. She moved 
slightly as if being woken from a reverie. 
Without turning her head, she flipped one 
of her plaits over her shoulder, laid it on her 
chest, and adjusted it. When the plait moved 
from her back to her front, it caressed me on 
its way. I yearned to embrace her. She had not 
responded to my question. I thought perhaps 
she did not hear me.
The train rolled on through a tunnel, engulfing 
the carriage in an artificial darkness. I assume 
she turned her gaze inwards during this time. 
When the train emerged from the tunnel, she 
lifted her head and looked at me. Our gazes 
met in a head-on collision. With a shy smile, 
she bowed her head once again.
The old fisherman on the basket was 
mumbling ādarē, mama ādarē (in love, I am 
in love). The baby in her mother’s embrace 
wiggled its toe playfully. The young man 
standing at the door thought of something and 
smiled.
I looked at her, and asked again, “Could you 
please let me have a look at your book?” Her 
hands moved. She took the book with care and 
placed it in my hands. I looked down on its 
cover. It said, ‘Two Poets - Dr. K. Kailasapathy.’ 
I was right – I decided that she was indeed 
deeply into literature.
I turned the cover over. The name ‘Piramiḷā’ 
was written in Tamil, Sinhala, and English. I 
turned the next page and asked, “Is your name 
‘Piramiḷā?”
She nodded, and asked, “What is your name?”
“Iḷaṅkō,” I responded. “Oh! You have the 
name of the author of Silappathikāram,” she 
laughed.
I flipped through the pages. I did not feel 
the urge to read even a single word. She was 
observing me.
“Do you know Sinhala?” I asked suddenly. She 
said, “I am deeply fond of literature. While 
I was reading Tamil literature, I accidentally 
came across the Tamil translation of a poem 
called ‘The House.’ A Sinhala poet had written 
that beautiful poem. From that day, I resolved 
to learn Sinhala so that I can read Sinhala 
literature in its original form. Now I know 
Sinhala reasonably well!”
“In that case, would you help me learn 
Sinhala?” I asked.
She laughed out loud. “We are on a train,” 
she said. “You and I are friends during this 
journey. Once the journey ends, we will go our 
separate ways,” she let out a deep sigh.

I have no idea how I mustered so much 
courage. I said, “Having met you in this train 
journey, I cannot forget you in my life journey, 
Piramiḷā; you have captured a permanent 
place in my heart.”
She smiled silently. Tear drops glistened in her 
eyes. Suddenly, she buried her face in my chest 
and cried. I stroked her hair.
The bearded old man kept staring at us. I did 
not pay attention to the others.
The train slowed down. She wiped her tears 
and said, “All these days, I was waiting for 
something. I found it here,” she pointed to my 
heart.
Presently she returned to her jovial self. 
“Would you return my book? My station is 
approaching.”
I gave the book back to her. The train came to 
a stop.
She got off the train, and told me, “Like you 
said, we met on this train journey, but I, too, 
cannot forget you in my life journey. It is from 
you that I received what I was expectantly 
searching for. Life is full of expectations, is 
it not.?” She brought her hands together in 
farewell.
Her beautiful form was disappearing from 
my view. The train blared plaintively in a 
sorrowful tone and started moving again. 
Through my tears, I saw the outline of her 
waving to me. I waved back.
The train has traveled far. I glanced inside the 
carriage. The fisherman with the basket, the 
young woman when the baby, and the young 
man, had all disembarked from the train. The 
bearded old man kept staring at me intently.
I cast my eyes outside. The crescent moon was 
disappearing behind the cloud cover.
The train was speeding towards its destination.
