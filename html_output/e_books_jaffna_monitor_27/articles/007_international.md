ICJ's Limited 
Ruling in the 
Israel-Hamas 
Conflict
BY:

O
n January 26, in a noteworthy session at The Hague, the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) promulgated six 
urgent directives targeting Israel amidst its continued conflict 
with Hamas in Gaza. This significant ruling was handed down 
as the ICJ began to deliberate on the serious allegations of 
genocide made by South Africa against Israel. This matter has 
attracted extensive global attention. Notably, the ICJ's ruling 
did not extend to commanding a cessation of military activities 
or curtailing any further military escalation. Furthermore, the 
ICJ stopped short of prescribing actions against individuals 
accused of genocide. This aspect of the ruling brings into sharp 
relief the constraints of the ICJ's powers, underscoring the 
court's limited authority in enforcing such directives.

South Africa, in its 84-page lawsuit filed last 
December, accused Israel of violating the 
1948 Genocide Convention during the war on 
Gaza, which began on October 7, 2023. The 
allegations, which Israel firmly rejects, citing 
self-defence measures against Hamas, have led 
to this unprecedented legal scrutiny.
The ICJ's ruling, a concise 45-minute 
judgment, confirmed its jurisdiction over the 
case. Among the measures ordered, Israel is 
mandated to prevent acts outlined in Article 
2 of the 1948 Genocide Convention. This 
includes abstaining from acts that could result 
in killing or causing harm to Palestinians, 
ensuring the delivery of essential services and 
humanitarian aid to Gaza, and preventing the 
destruction of evidence of war crimes.
Notably, the court did not address all of South 
Africa's requests, such as suspending military 
operations or preventing any escalation of 
military activities. This selective adherence to 
the requested measures has raised questions 
about the extent and impact of the ICJ's 
provisional orders.
The binding nature of the ICJ's interim ruling, 
while legally obligatory for UN member states, 
poses a challenge in terms of enforcement. 
The ICJ lacks direct enforcement mechanisms, 
placing the onus on international cooperation 
and potential intervention by the UN Security 
Council (UNSC). The role of the US, a close 
ally of Israel, becomes pivotal here, especially 
given its history of vetoing resolutions against 
Israel.
Looking ahead, Israel is required to submit a 
report by February 26 detailing its compliance 
with the ICJ's orders, followed by a response 
from South Africa. This process sets the stage 
for further assessments and deliberations, 
potentially leading to additional measures or 
rulings.
Amid these developments, the situation 
in Gaza remains tense, with humanitarian 
concerns escalating under the shadow of 
continued hostilities. The ICJ's focus on 
punitive measures for incitement to genocide 
and its special reference to comments by Israeli 
officials indicate a rigorous approach to the 
allegations.
