to properly guide the significantly larger 
number of Tamil youths who had joined. 
Unfortunately, all these leaders were incapable 
and immature to lead such a vast group 
effectively.
Prabhakaran's Tragic Rigidity: 
Dragging a Race to Conflict
The liberation struggle should have been more 
flexible. Leading liberation movements with 
an 'Eelam or nothing' attitude, as Prabhakaran 
did, is not viable. Prabhakaran believed that 
anyone deviating from the goal of Tamil Eelam 
was a traitor, a stance that was misguided. 
However, he remained steadfast in his goals 
and never wavered from his beliefs or ideology. 
He maintained the same ideology from the 
start of his struggle until his death. His belief 
that sacrificing one race for liberation led to 
numerous tragedies
Prabhakaran was indeed prepared to die 
in the war, but he had no right to drag an 
entire race to death with him. This was his 
significant mistake. Nevertheless, I still regard 
Prabhakaran as an honest man. Unfortunately, 
he lacked the right advisors; those around him 
were merely yes-men. Additionally, he was not 
in a position to accept advice from anyone else.
Prabhakaran's Leadership: Where 
Flattery Overshadowed Merit
There were situations where flattering 
Prabhakaran could lead to higher positions 
in the organization. I agree that, to a certain 
extent, he was susceptible to praise and loyalty, 
and merit became secondary for him.
I will tell you about this as an example. 
Lawrence Thilakar, who worked under me in 
my Military Office (MO), was a trainee in the 
third regiment of the LTTE in Salem camp 
and had joined the movement after coming 
from France. From what I observed, he lacked 
nationalist thoughts for ethnic liberation and 
was filled with extremist terrorist ideologies. 
Our military office then published 'Porkkural' 
(Voice of War), a magazine. However, it would 
be more appropriate to call it a textbook 
rather than a magazine. These military 
textbooks became mandatory reading in all

LTTE training camps. During my tenure with 
the LTTE, nine volumes of 'Porkkural' were 
published. Lawrence Thilakar suggested that 
we publish an article about the King David 
Hotel bombing in 1947 by the Jewish terror 
group 'Irgun' during the Jewish insurgency 
against British rule in Palestine. However, I 
refused, explaining to him that this was not an 
appropriate way to educate the LTTE cadres in 
training camps. 
In the first issue, I wrote an editorial explaining 
what the LTTE's military office should do, 
our ideology, and how we plan to achieve 
our objectives through it. In that editorial, 
Lawrence Thilakar asked me to write that we 
run this military office under Prabhakaran's 
leadership and guidance. I refused to do so. I 
said that MO is a work of collective teamwork 
of many hardworking people. We should 
promote team spirit, not individuality. It is 
not an individual action but a group action. 
Therefore, I said that there was no need to 
praise Prabhakaran overly. Yes, Prabhakaran's 
office is within the MO, but it has nothing to 
do with the day-to-day operations of the MO.
But Lawrence Thilakar must have 
misrepresented this to Prabhakaran. Two days 
before the magazine was set to go to print, 
Prabhakaran suddenly called me and asked me 
to meet a prominent supporter in Mumbai for 
political work. Despite having no involvement 
in political tasks, I flew to Mumbai. I ended 
up spending two unnecessary days there. 
When I returned to Chennai, the textbook

had already been printed, and the 
editorial included words praising 
Prabhakaran's leadership and 
ideas in managing the military 
office, just as Lawrence Thilakar 
had suggested. 
1985, during the Thimpu 
talks between various militant 
organizations, including the LTTE 
and the Sri Lankan government, 
Prabhakaran sent Lawrence 
Thilakar with me. However, 
Thilakar was very junior. There 
were many more senior members 
in the organization than he. Anton 
Balasingham was then responsible 
for the political wing, and many 
people were in his division. But 
Prabhakaran sent Lawrence 
Thilakar, a 'yes-man' to him, for 
the talks with me. The reason for 
this was Thilakar's flattery and his 
closeness to Prabhakaran. 
An incident about Thilakar 
during the Thimbu Talks is to 
be noted. All the Tamil parties 
agreed to line up based on 
the "4 Thimpu Principles". At 
the negotiation table, Tamil 
United Liberation Front (TULF) 
leaders Amrithalingham, 
Sivasithamparam, and EPRLF 
Varadaraja Perumal lambasted the 
Sri Lankan delegation by lecturing 
them in history lessons. Thilakar 
could not be found in his hotel 
room during the absence of talks. 
Then I found out he was chasing 
behind Varadaraja Perumal, 
begging him for a 'speech script' 
he wanted to deliver at the

negotiation table. I stopped his nonsense and 
reminded him that he was representing the 
LTTE, And I said that by his action, he was 
disgracing himself and the LTTE. I did not 
report this incident; otherwise, his career in 
the LTTE would have ended with zero.
I am a witness to Prabhakaran's great affection 
for the Muslim community. He always 
emphasized to me the importance of treating 
Muslims fairly and ensuring they receive 
their rights. His favourite places to eat were 
also Muslim-run shops, particularly one we 
nicknamed 'Mokka Kadai', located in the heart 
of the Muslim area. Another favourite was near 
the Tirunelveli Junction, close to the Jaffna 
campus. After watching the first or second 
show of English movies in the evening, we 
often visited there for Kottu Roti.
However, when I was in Canada 
in 1990, I was shocked to learn 
that the LTTE had expelled the 
Muslims from Jaffna on the orders 
of Prabhakaran and seized their 
property. It was then that I came 
to know that some of the leading 
members of the LTTE from the East, 
like Karuna and Karikalan, met 
Prabhakaran and changed his mind 
about expelling the Muslims. LTTE 
leaders from the East may have 
influenced Prabhakaran.
Equal Respect for All 
Martyrs of Tamil Liberation
I steadfastly refuse to accept the designation 
of LTTE martyrs as heroes while those from 
other liberation movements are labelled as 
traitors. Every individual who fought and 
sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the 
Tamil people in Eelam deserves respect and 
remembrance, regardless of their movement or 
organizational affiliation.
The practice of solely commemorating 
the LTTE while neglecting others must be 
discontinued. Now is a crucial time for Tamils 
to seek reconciliation and foster unity amongst 
themselves. It is a vital responsibility of the 
Tamil community.
By exclusively commemorating the LTTE 
annually and categorizing members of other 
movements as traitors, we only deepen 
the divisions within the Tamil community. 
We must adopt a collective approach to 
memorialize all those who laid down their 
lives for the liberation of the Tamil people 
without any bias based on their affiliations. 
This stance is non-negotiable for me. 
I expressed this sentiment a year ago on my 
Facebook page when I observed the unequal 
valuation of different individuals' lives.

Maravanpulavu K. Sachithananthan Reveals
Interview
BY: 
Our Special Correspondent
The Heart, Not Temples, 
the True Abode for 
Rama Worship: 
O
n January 22nd, coinciding with the 
inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya 
by Indian Prime Minister Modi, a worship event 
was held at the Varadaraja Perumal Temple in 
Ponnalai, Jaffna. This event, organized by the Siva 
Senai organization of Sri Lanka, has garnered

attention due to its focus on Lord Rama, a 
deity not commonly worshipped in Jaffna. 
In an effort to understand the significance of 
this event, we conducted an interview with 
Maravanpulavu K. Sachithananthan, the 
leader of the Siva Senai organization, seeking 
insights into the reasons behind organizing a 
special worship for Lord Rama in Jaffna.
Could you elucidate the reasons 
behind the special worship ceremony 
held in Jaffna, particularly in the 
context of Lord Ram not being a widely 
revered deity in that region?
Rama stands as a symbol, embodying a 
profound cultural heritage and acting as 
a guiding light for virtuous conduct and 
ethical living. Rama represents a figure 
that transcends traditional boundaries of 
religious worship and geographical confines, 
embodying a universal appeal. 
He epitomizes an inner spiritual ideal, 
fostering a form of devotion that is deeply 
personal and intimate. This unique aspect 
of his veneration is such that it does not 
necessitate a physical temple; rather, he can 
be worshipped within the inner sanctum of an 
individual's heart. 
His persona is a composite of various virtues 
— from martial prowess and bravery to 
profound love and unwavering marital fidelity. 
This multifaceted symbolism demands a 
rational interpretation, highlighting the role 
of emblematic figures in the progression of 
civilization. The significance of Rama lies not 
just in his historical or mythological existence 
but in his representation of wisdom and moral 
guidance. 
While historical evidence regarding his 
actual existence, birthplace, or life events 
remains sparse, archaeological findings near 
the Sarayu River in Ayodhya have shed light 
on the ancient roots of his worship. These 
discoveries, indicating the presence of a 
temple dedicated to Rama 500 years ago, 
formed the basis for the construction of the 
new temple at this historic site. This blend 
of archaeology and symbolism underscores 
Rama's enduring impact as a cultural and 
civilizational icon.
In an episode dating back five centuries, 
Babur, the founding emperor of the Mughal 
dynasty, undertook a consequential visit to the 
esteemed Ram Temple located in Ayodhya. 
Babur, renowned for his erudition, was well-
versed in the lore surrounding Rama. It was 
during his sojourn near this temple that he 
issued a decree for its destruction. 
However, this directive was not merely an act 
of religious or cultural antagonism towards 
the figure of Rama. Babur's intentions went 
beyond the mere destruction of the temple's 
physical structure. He aimed at the core of 
India's knowledge-based traditions, which 
were intrinsically interwoven with the 
narrative of Rama and manifested in various 
facets of Indian society - including economics, 
politics, culture, and martial prowess.

By targeting the symbol of Rama, Babur 
sought to efface these dimensions of Indian 
identity, deeming them a hindrance to his 
broader objective. This deliberate act of 
demolition was more than an architectural 
obliteration; it represented an attempt to 
erase a collective historical and cultural 
consciousness deeply embedded in the ethos 
of Rama. 
Babur's underlying ambition was to replace 
these indigenous values and memories with 
the Islamic tenets of the Mughal empire, 
thereby reshaping the cultural and historical 
landscape of India.
Throughout history, the pattern of cultural 
and religious imposition by invaders has been 
a recurring theme, with numerous instances 
across different regions. This phenomenon was 
not unique to Babur or the Mughal Empire. 
During their colonial endeavours in Sri 
Lanka, the Portuguese demolished revered 
Hindu temples such as Thiruketheeswaram, 
Thirukoneswaram, and Thondeeswaram, 
replacing the latter with a Christian church. 
This pattern of erasing pre-existing religious 
structures and supplanting them with those 
of the invaders' faith was evident across the 
Indian subcontinent. In Gujarat, the iconic 
Somnath Temple faced a similar fate, around 
900 years ago, with defenders subjected 
to brutalities and the temple itself being 
subjected to looting and destruction.
However, the resilience of the local 
populations in these areas is noteworthy. In 
Ayodhya, for instance, the local community 
has been tirelessly endeavouring for over 500 
years to rebuild the Ram Temple. Such efforts 
symbolize not just the restoration of a physical 
structure but the reclamation of a cultural and 
spiritual identity that had been systematically 
targeted.
Could you elaborate on the 
significance of the recent special 
worship conducted in Ponnalai?

The decision to conduct special worship in 
Ponnalai was deeply symbolic. This event 
has to be perceived not merely as a religious 
ceremony but as a pivotal moment marking 
the resurgence of our region's rich traditions 
and cultural heritage. The day, which 
historically symbolized an attempt to erode 
our cultural and traditional values, has been 
transformed into a beacon of their revival.
This event represents another turning point 
in history, where we reclaim our spiritual 
practices and legacy in areas like politics, 
valour, economy, and culture. The opening of 
the Ram Temple stands as a potent symbol of 
this reclamation. 
Our participation in the worship at Ponnalai 
was an embodiment of this sentiment, rooted 
in our tradition to honour and celebrate such 
transformative moments in our history. This 
ceremony was more than a ritual; it was a 
collective affirmation of our enduring cultural 
identity and a testament to our resilience in the 
face of historical adversities.
How do you interpret our traditional 
allegiances in the context of Sri 
Lanka's rich mythological history, often 
referred to as the land of Ravana? 
 The narrative of Rama and Ravana, central 
to the epic Ramayana, transcends mere 
allegorical interpretation, especially in the 
context of Sri Lanka's cultural identity. The 
question of whether our traditions align more 
closely with Rama or Ravana is intricate, 
considering the complex layers of this ancient 
narrative.
Contrary to the actions of historical 
conquerors like the Mughals or the 
Portuguese, whose invasions were driven by 
motives of religious imposition and cultural 
eradication, the conflict between Rama and 
Ravana in the epic is fundamentally different. 
The culmination of this mythological conflict, 
where Rama defeats Ravana, was not an act 
grounded in the desire to impose ideologies or 
destroy traditions. Instead, it stemmed from 
a deeply personal feud– Rama's response to 
Ravana's abduction of his wife, Sita.
It's crucial to understand that Rama's actions, 
as depicted in the Ramayana, were not 
motivated by a premeditated intention to 
annihilate Ravana or to dismantle the cultural 
fabric of Lanka. Rama did not embark on 
his journey with the objective of conquering 
Lanka or subjugating its people to his beliefs. 
His journey to Lanka was a reactive one, 
driven by the personal grievance of his

wife's kidnapping rather than a calculated 
plan to overthrow or undermine the existing 
civilization.
Thus, when considering the legacy of these 
mythological figures in the context of Sri 
Lanka's cultural and traditional identity, it's 
important to distinguish between the symbolic 
narratives of ancient epics and the historical 
realities of conquests and cultural dominance. 
The Ramayana offers a story that is deeply 
embedded in the cultural psyche, resonating 
through generations, but its interpretation and 
the allegiances it inspires are as diverse as the 
people who cherish it.
In the context of the North and East 
of Sri Lanka, where diverse religious 
practices prevail, is the worship of 
Rama viewed as a foreign element? 
Are there plans to introduce Rama 
worship in these regions?
Our approach towards the existing religious 
practices in the North and East of Sri Lanka 
has been one of non-interference and respect 
for the established worship methods of the 
region. We do not advocate the adoption of 
Rama worship as the sole path to spiritual 
fulfilment or salvation. 
It's important to 
acknowledge that 
devotion to Rama 
already exists among 
thousands of devotees, 
particularly evident in 
daily worship at the 
Ponnalai Varadaraja 
Perumal Temple. This 
devotion emerges 
spontaneously from 
the hearts of the 
worshippers, not as a 
result of any directive 
from us.
The reconstruction of 
the Ram Temple at 
the site where the Babri Masjid once stood 
is indeed a significant historical event. Our 
worship and gratitude are in recognition 
of this event and its historical and cultural 
implications. It is not an attempt to impose 
this form of worship on others. We honour 
the diversity of religious beliefs and practices, 
and our focus remains on celebrating this 
momentous occasion rather than advocating 
for a change in the religious practices of the 
local populace.
