n our February 1st edition of the Jaffna Monitor, we are thrilled to present 
an exclusive interview with Dr. Sabesan Sithamparanathan, a Cambridge 
alumnus and luminary in the technology world. His remarkable journey from 
the challenging terrains of war-torn Jaffna to becoming the Founder and 
President of the multimillion-dollar company PervasID is not just inspiring; 
it's a testament to the boundless potential of the human spirit and intellect.
Recently honored with the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) 
award in the King's 2024 New Year Honours List, Dr. Sithamparanathan's 
story stands as a beacon of hope and a vivid illustration of how education 
can be a powerful tool for transformation. His achievements are not just 
a personal triumph but a source of pride and motivation for countless 
individuals around the globe.
In the second part of our gripping series, "Anton Master Speaks," we continue 
our dialogue with KT Sivakumar, also known as Anton Master. A prominent 
early member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and a close 
associate of leader Prabhakaran, his insights into the organization are 
invaluable. Through these dialogues, we aim to provide our readers with rare 
insights into the history and inner workings of the LTTE, directly from a key 
figure in its history. This offers a unique opportunity to understand a pivotal 
chapter in our collective past from a first-hand perspective.
Our special feature this month includes an article by K.S. Lakshmi, an ex-
leading figure of the LTTE. Writing under a pseudonym, Lakshmi shares 
profound reflections and experiences from a turbulent period in our history.
Additionally, our reporter's investigation into the burgeoning parking fee 
issue in Jaffna highlights the growing public discontent. The imposition of 
fees by the Jaffna Municipal Council is more than a mere inconvenience; it's a 
situation that demands immediate attention.
As we present these diverse and powerful stories, along with many more, we 
hope to offer our readers perspectives that enlighten, challenge, and inspire. 
Each narrative, in its own way, reflects the resilience and complexity of the 
human experience. We are honored to be the conduit for these voices and 
stories, and we thank you, our readers, for joining us on this journey of 
exploration and understanding.
Warm regards,
