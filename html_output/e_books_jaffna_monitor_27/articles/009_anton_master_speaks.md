Rapid Surge and Leadership Crisis in Tamil 
Militant Groups Post-1983
After the ethnic riots of 1983, all the militant organizations, 
including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), 
People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), 
Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), Eelam 
People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), and 
Part- 2
KT Sivakumar, also known as 
Anton Master, is a prominent 
early member of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and a close associate of leader 
Prabhakaran. He significantly 
contributed to the LTTE 
as a member of its Central 
Committee and as the founder 
and head of the Military Office 
(MO), enhancing the group's 
military effectiveness. Known 
for his reticence in media 
interactions, Sivakumar prefers 
'dialogues' over interviews. 
The following is a part of a 
series of dialogues I had with 
him, providing rare insights, 
which will be featured in the 
forthcoming issues.

Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students 
(EROS), experienced exponential growth. 
These groups grew disproportionately large, a 
situation not fittingly described by the Tamil 
phrase 'tpuYf;Nfj;j tPf;fk;' (a swelling that 
fits the finger), their expansion was beyond 
what was manageable. Many people joined 
these movements, and their leaders quickly 
became seen as heroes.
However, the mindset of those who joined 
after the 1983 riots was predominantly 
marked by a mix of desires for revenge, anger, 
confusion, and an overestimation of Indian 
support and training. Joining these movements 
became a matter of pride. Yet, there was a 
general sentiment akin to, 'I don't know where 
we're going, but judging by the size of this 
crowd, it must be good!' kind of Fk;gypy; 
Nfhtpe;jh mentality, or "Following the crowd 
enthusiastically." 
Everyone knew there was a need to fight back, 
but there was uncertainty about who the 
enemy was, who to target, and who were allies. 
Knowledge about the Geneva Conventions, 
war crimes, or crimes against humanity was 
virtually absent.
Before the 1983 riots, the LTTE and other 
groups were relatively small and manageable. 
The mistakes and errors committed were 
minor. However, after the riots, it became the 
responsibility of these movements' leaders

and Balakumar (EROS) Unite with Prabhakaran (LTTE) in Their Quest for Eelam. Later, Sabaratnam and 
Pathmanaba were killed on the order of Prabhakaran, while Balakumar disbanded his EROS, accepting 
Prabhakaran's leadership to save his life, and became a part of the LTTE.
