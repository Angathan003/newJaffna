 The ODI that Had It All:
T
he rapidly changing landscape of Cricket has unleashed many 
thrills. Yet amidst this tectonic shift, the old-fashioned lure of 
ODI Cricket has been challenged. A 50-over match, offering an 
even tussle between bat and ball, is a beauty in cricket that remains 
unmatched. For many of us who followed the game pre-2015 
mainly, the nostalgia of cult classics is a feel that's hard to describe. 
Today, we will revisit one such Sri Lanka-India classic from 2013.
In mid-2013, Sri Lanka was facing India in the final of a triangular 
series in the West Indies. India was the reigning Champions 
Trophy winner, crowned merely weeks before. They had secured 
their place over Sri Lanka in the semi-finals. Both teams had won 
one game each against each other in this tournament. India's main 
man, MS Dhoni, was back for the final. The pitch at Port of Spain 
wasn't the usual flat track but one that was destined to test both 
batters and bowlers.
Sri Lanka batting first found it hard to push the pedal. Tharanga 
and Mahela, who had made the Indian attack look like a secondary 
school attack only days before, perished without much noise in

the game that mattered. With two early 
wickets down, it was time for Sri Lanka's 
superstar Sangakkara to make his mark. 
At this juncture, Sangakkara was changing 
the game in ODIs. He was morphing into 
a white ball monster too. The signs were 
obvious. A scrumptious match-winning 
ton at the Oval against England a few 
weeks prior was an indicator. But on this 
day, grit and grind were the requirements. 
Sangakkara, in partnership with 
Thirimanne, obliged.
From 49-2, the pair steered Sri Lanka to 
171-2. With a well-set launch pad, Sri 
Lanka was placed to boss the game. With 
the track crumbling, 240 was surely going 
to be a match-winning score. Thirimanne's 
dismissal, followed by a miscalculation 
from Sangakkara immediately afterwards 
in a quest to score quick runs, opened the 
floodgates for India. Wickets tumbled like 
nine pins, unable to withstand Ravi Jadeja's 
relentless bowling. Sri Lanka lost the last eight 
wickets for 30 runs, ending up with a paltry 
201. The late-order collapse highlighted the 
value of Sangakkara's skill. His 71 off 100 
wasn't a knock that many would remember, 
but it was a display of skill, fitness, and most 
importantly, the ability to rise when it mattered 
amidst a never-ending glut of games.
202 was supposed to be a cakewalk for the 
mighty Indian lineup. However, it wasn't to be. 
Indian innings followed the same pattern as 
Sri Lanka. Thanks to some excellent deliveries, 
Dhawan, in top form, and Kohli, Sri Lanka's 
newfound nemesis, were quickly dismissed. 
It was the turn of Rohit, who was turning 
everything he touched into gold, having led 
Mumbai to their first title win in IPL and 
establishing himself as an opener to drive India 
ahead. Partnering him was Dinesh Karthick, 
who, on his own, was in the middle of a purple 
patch. As the duo steadied the ship through 
old-fashioned accumulation, Sri Lanka's 
Test star Herath intervened in style, snaring 
Karthik. Raina and Rohit dashed any hopes of 
a Sri Lankan comeback, steering India back on 
track. It was a critical phase for Raina as Kohli 
had led India in MS Dhoni's absence earlier, 
leading to even an ugly spat in the field with 
Jadeja revolving around the snub. However, 
nothing mattered as India seemed to have 
cracked the code in the chase.
Again, it was Herath's turn as he clean-bowled 
Rohit with a delivery that was kept low. 
Immediately afterwards, Raina played a loose 
drive, edging the ball to Sangakkara. Suddenly, 
the Sri Lankan hopes were alive. Yet, India 
boasted a strong lower order. The game was in 
the balance.
Any hope of a lower-order resurgence was 
thwarted by the brilliance of Herath. A Test 
match specialist was turning the heat on as he 
trapped Jadeja and Ashwin within a blink of 
an eye, pushing India to 152 for 7 with only

Dhoni left. India inched slowly towards the 
target with the stubbornness of Bhuvaneswar 
Kumar and Vinay Kumar alongside Dhoni. 
However, the tail-enders didn't last long, and 
both were dismissed, with India still 20 runs 
short of victory.
To make matters worse for India, Dhoni was 
literally batting on one leg and wasn't finding it 
easy to run. All things combined, it looked like 
Ishant Sharma played out an over to set Dhoni 
up for a final over climax. From needing 20 
from 23 balls, the equation was down to 15 
off 5, with Eranga in action. The nature of the 
track meant that Malinga was taken away for 
runs and wasn't available for the last over.
In true Dhoni style, Dhoni struck 6,4,6 to 
take India home without breaking sweat. The 
bowler worked for the man with the Midas 
touch, taking it deep and pressurising. As for 
Sri Lanka, it was so close yet so far. The Indo-
Lanka rivalry was at its peak, characterised by 
high-quality cricket during this phase, making 
a final loss to India particularly painful.
Despite the outcome or the context, the title 
clash at Port of Spain was a game to cherish. It 
was a game where old-fashioned ODI batting 
and consistent bowling-sustaining pressure 
were rewarded compared to the mainstream 
slam-back styles. Dhoni's determination 
triumphed over Sanga's grit, and India 
prevailed over Sri Lanka in yet another final.
This game would rarely be recollected as 
a classic. Yet, for those who stayed up late 
to watch on either side of the Palk Strait, it 
remains a game that signified the beauty of 
ODI cricket, a quality often missed in the 
current landscape of the sport.

Story
T
he cold wind assaulted Kandappu’s body. 
He was walking briskly, swinging his arms 
in wide arcs. The wind was caking his shirtless 
body with copious amounts of Iṇuvil’s famed fine 
red dust. A chest that looked like the lifeforce 
had departed from its cage; a slightly oversized 
head that seemed to have been hastily glued on 
to this chest; sunken eyes; a physique that would, 
on any government servant, instantly merit a 
nvitation

‘medical certificate;’ all together, the sight of 
Kandappu’s forceful gait on that desolated 
road did indeed have the potential to inspire a 
bit of terror.
Surprisingly, a bus came into view at a 
distance. “Perhaps take the bus just for 
today?” Kandappu was tempted. His hands 
unconsciously reached for the knot at his hip. 
The seventeen cents that had been hiding 
there for three days, reeked of sweat.
- if the boss is going to pay up today … … 
at least I can settle the small loans somehow. 
I’ve got to pay back at Suppaiyā’s shop. He 
will stake out at home waiting for me … these 
last four days have been fasting days … mmm 
… I am leaving my little girl to fend off the 
lenders … chee … what an existence …
- there is no sugar for morning tea … … 
for how long can one manage to drink tea 
with a piece of jaggery? … mmm … I am 
increasingly feeling weaker with each passing 
day … must buy some iron tablets from the 
dispensary … how dextrous I was when I was 
younger … … now, as I age, my hand is no 
longer flexible.
As he approached the Muniyappa temple, 
Kandappu’s hand instinctively reached for the 
piece of cloth he was wearing on his shoulder. 
Without missing a step, he brought his hands 
together at his chest in worshiping position 
and called out aloud to the deity,” appaṉē 
muṉiyappā”.
- Why, if I have a boy to help me at work 
today, I could easily roll sixty, seventy … 
… I could bring the little boy along. But my 
heart wouldn’t listen … at least he should get 
a basic education … the rascal … yesterday 
he broke his slate … he is not going to learn 
… maybe I should drag him along to train 
him at work … no … he shouldn’t end up in 
this godforsaken profession …. even dying is 
better than this … if he learns this miserable 
trade, he will resign himself to it.
… chee! I did get the job as a railway 
doorman. I listened to my angel of misfortune 
and let my chance for a government job slip 
away! I deserve to be beaten with a slipper…
As he passed the Raja Mill Lane, Kandappu 
instinctively scanned the horizon. A cassava 
seller was passing the junction towards him. 
He thought “She can’t see me” and crouched 
down to sit on his haunches. A lantana tree 
tickled his thigh. He kept playing with the 
leaves of a touch-me-not shrub.
His body shivered for some reason.
As he passed the house of the pariyāri, the 
traditional āyurvêda doctor, he thought of his 
wife again. “Hospital medicine hasn’t made 
her better … I must take her to the Vēlaṇai  
pariyāri…”
He felt a little dizzy. Only when he turned 
into the gravel and limestone Māththaṉai

lane did he start to appreciate the asphalt road 
that he just left. Thuraiappā and Kandaiya 
were on bicycles ahead of him. “Had the 
wife not fallen ill, I wouldn’t have had to sell 
the bicycle … When am I going to acquire a 
bicycle again?”
“Hello, it looks like you haven’t opened the 
shop yet …”
“Yes aṇṇai… I was a little late in waking 
up today.” ’s eldest daughter was sweeping 
their front yard. — Isn’t my Pūraṇam the 
same age as this girl? But she is a tad taller 
…  has somehow succeeded in taking care 
of his daughter’s matter … I, too, will have 
to find a match for Pūraṇam … But I don’t 
have anything to lavish on her as dowry… 
just her luck, she wasn’t born into a home that 
she deserved to be born into… … that boy 
Sanmugam has learned to drive a car … … he 
could be a good match … … but who knows 
how much Vayiravaṉ would demand?

Although no one spent any money to hang 
huge signboards at those small Kokuvil cigar 
factory sheds, those in the know can identify 
cigar sheds without any difficulty whatsoever. 
If a strong smell wafts through the tired 
commiphora trees that line fences along a 
lane, one can guess that a cigar shed is nearby.
As he pushed the door open, he could hear 
Murukēsu’s voice. …mmm… looks like I 
am late again today … he hung his piece 
of cloth on the clothesline, grabbed some 
tobacco clippings and started loosening them 
in his palms. They were coarse. He thought of 
sprinkling some kōda, the concoction made 
by boiling tobacco stems for several days, and 
then mixed with arrack, sugar, and spices to 
cure them but was afraid of the potential for a 
weight increase.
“What is it, Murukēsu… … it is “diamond” 
today, right?”
“No aṇṇan! Now there is a demand for 
‘brilliant’; that is what you, too, will be doing 
today.”
Kandappu’s stomach churned. He never quite 
got used to this new size cigar type with fat 
tails.

“… … Thambi Suppiramaṇiyam … … throw 
me a thread spool, child… …”
“Here Kandappu … … watch out for today’s 
size … … it can easily go wrong …. I have 
put out four wrapper leaves for you … 
yesterday, only when I was packing your cigar 
bundles that I noticed … … your knots had 
come loose and the rolled cigar had opened up 
at both ends - just keep your eyes open, ok?”
When he rolled his first cigar and looked for 
the thread on his right thigh to close the cigar 
and tie the knot, his hand started shaking 
again … … he found himself mumbling 
something.
* * *
Even by the time that the twelve o’clock train 
went past, Kandappu’s hands hadn’t gotten 
used to the task. The tobacco clippings had 
turned coarse in the heat. The inner leaf broke 
as soon as one tried to open it. The wrapper 
leaf didn’t stay put when he tied it up and 
the cigar ends immediately opened back up. 
Perhaps he would manage a hundred and 
thirty or a hundred and forty.
When the cutter - just a young boy, but quite 
skilled and was the right hand of the boss 
- came by and started trimming the rolled 
cigars, Kandappu started to be nervous.
“What is this man, you have blindly stuffed 
it full of tobacco clipping as if you are filling 
a coconut sack. It is sagging. Look here 
everyone … …!” Kandappu’s cigar was 
paraded around for all to inspect. He died of 
embarrassment and shame.
Mmm… …what a shameless existence!
When the bread vendor came by at lunch 
time, Kandappu bought half a pound as usual, 
and bit into it accompanied by the fire from 
the two green chillies that he had secretly 
plucked off from his boss’ backyard. When 
the twisted bread descended through his 
parched throat with great difficulty, his weak 
eyes watered.
Despite his hunger, he couldn’t eat all that 
bread. That day the Mahābhāratha chapter 
on Abhimaṉyu’s torture was being read out 
aloud during the story session at the cigar 
shed. When the story reached the place where 
everyone surrounded the child Abhimanyu 
in a circular formation and Abhimaṉyu cried 
out “Father!”, Kandappu was close to tears. 
He felt as if the entire world were Kauravas, 
the clan who surrounded the young unarmed 
Abhimaṉyu, and he faced them alone and 
helpless.
A torturous grief enveloped his heart.
At the end of the day, Kandappu waited for 
the boss to settle his accounts.
“Look Kandappu, look at this… … … if you 
do a messy job like this, who am I going to 
palm it off on to .. … after four days, they are 
going to send it right back to me.”
When the boss put the cigar back into 
the stock, he whispered, although within 
Kandappu’s earshot,
“Have all the other cigar sheds in the village 
burned down? …if he wants to stick with me 
… …”
The pillar holding up the cigar shed, which he 
has been accustomed to for thirty years, the 
bales of tobacco leaves, the iron box, the pile 
of dried tobacco stalks; everything was a blur 
in his eyes.
He stood up like a machine to throw the stems 
of wrapping leaves away. A piece of string 
dragged along with him, steadfastly stuck to

his vēṭṭi, as if it is making fun of his sense of 
loyalty.
When he opened the gate to step outside, 
the silent wail of his anguish was deafening: 
“must I come back in through the same gate 
tomorrow? Again?”
Two days’ worth of ration book coupons are 
yet to be cut … … Mayilaṉ is going to camp 
out at home waiting for me … …
As he passed the library, the old woman 
Nākammā was waiting for her usual `wee 
smoke’. He took the country cigar from 
behind his ear and offered it to her. As he 
neared his home, his feet refused to move.
He could hear the sounds of Siṉṉāchchi 
coughing and Pūraṇam tearing off coconut 
leaves.
He washed his feet by the well and stretched 
his legs on the veranda. He was scared to ask

Siṉṉāchchi how she was doing. The deathly 
silence shook him.
Hunger gnawed at him.
Anger towards Pūraṇam boiled up from 
within him.
Did she notice that her appu had come home? 
What arrogance … … mmm.
In the heat of hunger his anger was engulfing 
him. He gritted his teeth and waited patiently.
“Appu come to eat.”
He eagerly turned his head; but there was no 
one; it was just a hallucination.
Where on earth did she go? Have I become an 
object of ridicule?
No sooner had he peeked in the direction of 
the well than his anger spilled over the limit.
“What is this you moron — why do you spend 
so much time at the well? … … who are you 
flirting with? … … you overgrown idiot … 
…” He picked up the water pot and banged it 
against her slender waist with all the force he 
could muster.
“aiyō appu” she screamed.
Heavy blows fell on her back.
Siṉṉāchchi, who was lying down inside, 
moaned in a feeble voice “aiyō why on earth 
are you killing her?”
“Satans… devils…!”
“Where are you coming from you rascal.”
The stunned little boy was lost for words. His 
fear swallowed half his words.
“akkā … aunt … house … āāā!”
“Rascal… are you gallivanting around from 
house to house all evening? … How long has 
it been since the evening lights were lit? … 
Did you study? … Is this how you study? … 
Dēy, is this how you are going to succeed in 
your studies? …”
His back was turning pink.
“Appu my appu. I swear on my appu. Please 
don’t hit me… aiyō you are hurting me. 
I swear on appu… … my appu … I even 
washed your vēṭṭi for you… I washed your 
vēṭṭi, appu…”
He dropped what he was hiding in his hands.
The fish curry he brought for his appu from 
his aunt’s house was blending with the soil.
* * *
Big sobs and small sobs from the inside 
alternated. Kandappu sat on the outer veranda 
wiping his sweat away. Each sob was piercing 
him like a spear. The pain that bubbled up 
from within him made him forget the pain of 
hunger.
The moon was gradually rising in the sky.
“Darling, give your father something to eat,” 
Siṉṉāchchi moaned with difficulty.
There was no sound from inside.
“If everyone insists on being stubborn, who is 
going to console whom? … here … why don’t 
you go and eat? … she, too, is waiting without 
eating …”
Kandappu went inside, pulled out a low stool 
and sat down. Without a word, Pūraṇam

washed a pot and set it down in front of him.
He picked up the hair stuck on the bottom 
of the pot and threw it away without her 
noticing.
Had this been a different occasion, how many 
blows would this have led to…
The rice was just as warm as it should be. 
“that fish gravy would have been so good with 
this…” Kandappu’s heart wept. He ate the 
rice with the mango sambal that Pūraṇam had 
freshly ground. It tasted divine. He longed to 
ask “… is there more rice left in the pot?” but 
he did not have the guts to meet Pūraṇam’s 
eyes.
He gargled his mouth, drank a few mouthfuls 
of water, lit a cigar and went out to get some

air. Inside the mud kitchen with palmyrah 
stem fencing, in the faint light of the kerosene 
lamp, she was eating.
Kandappu felt a sudden knot in his belly. It 
is doubtful if she had lunch. Once again, she 
was munching on the piece of bread that the 
little boy got for free from school.
For the second time that day, Kandappu’s eyes 
glistened with tears.
* * *
Pūraṇam threw the sleeping mat on the 
veranda and rushed back inside. The silence 
could kill Kandappu. Before he could ask 
aloud, she brought water in a copper pot and 
left it by the veranda.
The little boy had fallen asleep on his 
stomach, his cheeks stained by dried tears. 
Pūraṇam lifted him and laid him down on the 
sleeping mat. She locked the gate and placed 
the oil lamp in its niche. For some reason, she 
turned to look at Kandappu with pity in her 
eyes. That was her way of saying ‘appu I am 
going to bed.’
He attempted several times to find ways to

start a conversation but failed. There were 
no clothes drying on the clothesline. Still, he 
wondered if he could call out to her `daughter, 
take the saree from the clothesline inside’. 
Let’s wait till dawn — he consoled himself.
Perhaps he had unrolled the sleeping mat the 
wrong way, he felt his back itch all over. As 
if it wasn’t enough, his body felt hot all over. 
The occasional gust of wind sprayed copious 
amounts of dust. The dirt stuck to the body 
and made it feel sticky.
“How many vows had I made for the little 
boy! … poor kid, I pounced on him blindly 
like a devil…all my fingers on that tender 
back … perhaps I should go stroke him 
gently. Poor boy … shirtless, lying down with 
his fly undone …”
A giant sigh escaped him. He remembered 
how the little boy had held up his only shirt, 
caked with dirt, and asked his sister “akkā is 
this the right side?”
When the next account is settled, he should 
have a shirt tailored for the little boy.
He sat up on the veranda cross legged and 
peeked inside. Pūraṇam’s feet were sticking 
out of the entrance. I can only rest after I 
marry her off to a good place … … … what 
have I given her ever since she was born? … 
… … as she lay sleeping in the faint light of 
the lamp, he tried to visualize her face.
“If the little boy passes eighth grade, I could 
send him to work at the co-operative society 
store… … …”
He heard Pūraṇam turn over in her sleep.
How did I hit her on her thin waist, my 
goodness! … did I break her waist … how 
could I, ignoring the fact that she is a young 
woman! … how she toils all day! … let me 
get up early in the morning and make a couple 
of buckets of hot water. A bath can soothe her 
body aches.
The wind brought in another gust of dust.
Perhaps I should sprinkle a bucket of water … 
…
With that thought he fell asleep.
* * *
“Appu!”
He woke up with a start. That faint voice. 
Who called out? The little boy? The emotion 
in the voice made him feel uneasy; He had a 
vision of Kandappu lying down lifeless, and 
the little boy wailing. Next — the little boy is 
walking along the road, with a piece of cloth 
on his shoulder, and swinging his arms — to 
roll cigars.
Somewhere, a dog howled.
It seems howling dogs herald the arrival 
of Yama! He shivered and groped in the 
darkness; below the shadow of that crooked 
mango tree branch, a shadow scampered 
away.
Above, the branch that looked like dark blobs, 
swayed gently.
It invited him, ‘come come’.
If I … … if I die, what will happen to the little 
boy… … to Pūraṇam? …
He couldn’t fall asleep the rest of that night; 
he lay down watching that mango tree branch 
intently, without batting his eyes.
It appeared to be calling for him with love 
‘come come’.
