iscussions about the upcoming 
presidential election have begun in 
the Tamil political arena. One of the first to 
express an opinion on the presidential election 
was Suresh Premachandran, Secretary of the 
Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation 
Front (EPRLF) and a leader of the Democratic 
Tamil National Alliance (DTNA). He had 
suggested, months earlier, that a common 
Tamil candidate should be nominated for the 
presidential election. Following his proposal, 
the DTNA announced at a meeting in Mannar 
their intention to nominate a common Tamil 
candidate.

Leader C.V. Vigneswaran has also expressed 
support for this idea. True to his self-
aggrandizing nature, he went a step further 
by declaring his readiness to be the common 
Tamil candidate in the presidential election.
The Tamil National People's Front (TNPF), 
consistent with its unconventional functioning 
style, has announced that it will not participate 
in any form of the presidential election. 
Furthermore, the leaders of the TNPF even 
scoffed at the idea of appointing a common 
candidate.
Up to this point, the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK), which is embroiled in a legal 
battle over its party leadership, has not clearly 
articulated its stance. As ITAK's leaders were 
preoccupied with internal ego clashes and 
ongoing political battles in court. 
Against this backdrop, a symposium named 
'People's Petition' was recently held in Jaffna, 
focusing on discussions about nominating a 
common Tamil candidate for the presidential 
election. Sritharan, the leader recently elected 
by the ITAK in their internal election, also 
attended. The majority of political leaders 
at the symposium voiced their support for a 
common Tamil candidate. 
However, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, a 
Batticaloa district Member of Parliament and a 
prominent figure in the Sumanthiran faction of 
ITAK, has expressed opposition to the idea of 
a common Tamil candidate for the presidential 
election.
Political observers note that enthusiasm for a 
common Tamil candidate might diminish if 
the ITAK does not lend its support. Therefore, 
they have pointed out that the success of 
the initiative to nominate a common Tamil 
candidate largely hinges on ITAK's decision. 
Currently embroiled in a leadership contest 
and internal conflicts, the Tamil Arasu Katchi 
appears incapable of making a collective 
decision. As long as their legal issues remain 
unresolved, political observers suggest that 
their ability to make a unified choice seems 
unlikely.
It is clear that even if the parties unite to 
nominate a common presidential candidate 
for the Sri Lankan Tamils, it will not be 
significantly effective considering the 
demographic disparity between the Tamil 
and Sinhala populations in Sri Lanka. Due to 
this disparity, The Tamil community cannot 
realistically secure a win in a presidential 
election. 
However, as some optimists believe, 
nominating a common Tamil candidate could 
symbolize a show of unity and solidarity 
among Tamils in the electoral process. Yet, this 
symbolic gesture might not have a significant 
impact on the actual outcome of the election. 
It may also not encourage active participation 
from Tamil parties and their supporters, given 
the improbability of winning the presidency 
under these circumstances.
In this scenario, a few political observers 
believe that Tamil parties intending to 
support a Sinhala candidate likely to win the 
presidential election could play a pivotal role. 
They argue that such support places these 
parties in a strategic position for negotiation 
with the presidential candidate, potentially 
providing them with leverage and influence in 
the decision-making process. These observers 
also contend that while nominating a common 
Tamil candidate for the Sri Lankan presidential 
election might hold symbolic significance, 
such a move is unlikely to affect the actual 
outcome of the election and risks being 
perceived as a futile gesture.

hobasakthi, an eminent Sri Lankan Tamil 
author, is renowned for his exceptional 
narrative skills, endowing his prose with a vivid 
and dynamic vitality. His Novels, especially 
'Gorilla', 'M', 'BOX: A Story Book', and 'Ichaa', 
have achieved significant acclaim within the 
Tamil diaspora and have been translated into 
multiple languages. In addition to his prowess 
in novel writing, Shobasakthi exhibits a 
remarkable adeptness in crafting short stories 
and essays, further demonstrating his versatile 
literary competence.
Shobashakthi's artistic journey took a notable 
turn in 2015 when he expanded his horizons 
from the literary world to cinema, showcasing 
his acting skills in the French film 'Dheepan'. 
In this movie, he portrayed the role of a Sri 
Lankan refugee. This performance contributed 
to the film's triumph in securing the prestigious 
Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, thus 
accentuating his multifaceted artistic talent. 
Having embarked on his literary career with 
the publication of his inaugural short story in 
1997,  Shobashakthi has since charted a deep 
and enduring course in the sphere of literature, 
continuously infusing it with his distinctive 
insights and stylistic eloquence. 
Shobashakthi's literary oeuvre deeply explores 
the experiences of Sri Lankan Tamils, blending 
acute observations with a mixture of wit 
and political satire. His unique approach in 
addressing complex issues, combined with 
his bold criticism of entrenched beliefs and 
dominant opinions, whether it concerns the 
caste system or the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE), has attracted a wide-ranging 
readership. His audience includes numerous 
admirers who praise his work, as well as 
others who vehemently denounce him and his 
writings. 
The saying, "You can love him or hate him, 
but you definitely can't ignore him," aptly 
encapsulates the impact of Shobashakthi on 
Eelam Tamil literature. Despite the diverse 
opinions surrounding his work, Shobashakthi's 
influence is undeniable. His contributions have 
become an essential element of its history, 
profoundly enriching and significantly shaping 
the narrative of Eelam Tamil literature. 
We recently had the privilege of sitting down 
with the maverick writer Shobasakthi for an 
exclusive interview with Jaffna Monitor. Here 
are the excerpts from our conversation.
