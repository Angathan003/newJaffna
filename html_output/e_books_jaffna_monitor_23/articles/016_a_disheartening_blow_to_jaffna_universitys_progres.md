n a move that has been widely regarded as both misguided 
and authoritarian, the Vice-Chancellor of Jaffna University, 
Prof. S. Srisatkunarajah, has issued an internal circular 
putting an end to the influx of personal donations to 
university departments without his express approval.
This decree, which has sent shockwaves through the 
academic community, not only undercuts the autonomy 
of the departments but also jeopardizes the welfare of the 
students who stand to lose the most from this autocratic 
edict. The decision to centralize and control donations 
threatens to unravel the fabric of a system that has thrived on 
the goodwill and support of alums and benefactors. 
Departments across the university, including highly regarded 
ones like the Medical Faculty, have long benefited from 
the generosity of donors who have been instrumental in 
driving progress through scholarships, funding research, 
and updating equipmentâ€”all essential to the maintenance 
and advancement of the university's esteemed academic 
programs.
By enforcing a blanket restriction, the Vice-Chancellor 
seems to be curtailing the proactive initiatives undertaken 
by individual departments to improve their financial and

educational resources. The requirement 
for donations to be funnelled through a 
central approval process hints at a disturbing 
inclination towards the consolidation of 
power, which can lead to bureaucratic delays, 
inefficiency, and perhaps even corruption. It 
strips the departments of their ability to engage 
directly with their benefactors, whom the red 
tape and potential for misallocation of funds 
may dissuade.
The rationale for this decision, which is 
to ensure transparency and align with the 
university's mission, rings hollow given the 
probable outcome: a decrease in resources 
crucial for supporting the educational needs 
of the students. The Vice-Chancellor's 
policy could create a chilling effect on future 
donations, discouraging philanthropists 
from contributing to an institution where 
the use of their funds may become mired in 
administrative quagmire.
In an era where higher education institutions 
across the globe are increasingly seeking 
autonomy to foster innovation and excellence, 
the recent policy adopted by the University 
of Jaffna appears to be a deviation from this 
progressive trend. This policy, which ostensibly 
aims at ensuring accountability, seems to 
veer towards an unnecessary centralization 
of control. Such a move is likely to impede 
the institution's growth and may engender 
dissatisfaction among its students and faculty.
The Vice-Chancellor must reassess this policy 
in light of its potential long-term consequences 
on the university's progress. Engaging in 
constructive dialogue with department heads, 
faculty members, students, and donors is 
essential. This collaborative approach would 
help in devising a strategy that not only aligns 
with the interests of the university community 
but also supports the unique needs of the 
institution. The University of Jaffna has 
historically benefited from strong, department-
specific support networks. It is important that 
these networks are not just preserved but also 
strengthened to ensure the overall well-being 
and advancement of the university's academic 
environment.
