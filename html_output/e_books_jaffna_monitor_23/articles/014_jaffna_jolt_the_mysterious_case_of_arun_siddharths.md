n a twist that could rival a political thriller, 
the appointment of Arun Siddharth (alias 
Arulanantham Arun) as the United National 
Party (UNP) organizer for the Jaffna District 
has turned from a celebratory announcement 
into a bewildering conundrum.
Initially, in a scene brimming with pomp and 
circumstance at a wedding hall in Jaffna, Ravi 
Karunanayake, the UNP's assistant leader and 
a major political heavyweight, heralded Arun's 
appointment. This move wasn't just a mere 
political decision but a statement reflecting 
Karunanayake's influential standing and 
Arun's escalating manoeuvres in the political 
arena.
The venue was electrified by the cheers 
of hundreds of Arun's supporters. That 
evening, Arun took to Facebook with a 
bold declaration: 'The Era of Oppressed 
People Turning into Leaders Begins.' Arun, 
hailing from an oppressed caste in Jaffna, 
unapologetically embraced his caste identity 
as a badge of honour, in stark contrast to other 
leaders from oppressed castes, who shied away 
from theirs due to the social stigma associated 
with it.
But just when it seemed the political stars 
were aligning for Arun, the plot thickened. 
In a staggering volte-face, President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, also the head honcho of the 
UNP, who was on a one-day visit to Jaffna, 
denied the appointment during a meeting with 
local Jaffna UNP functionaries. This abrupt 
U-turn sparked a wildfire of speculation. Had 
the political winds shifted overnight?

those few days remain 
shrouded in mystery. 
Rumours of internal party 
turbulence and dissent 
abound – was this the 
reason for the sudden public 
disparity? Moreover, Arun, 
often criticized by ultra-Tamil 
nationalists as a supposed 
ally of military intelligence 
– a claim he refutes – found 
himself in an even tighter 
spot. With these denials, 
the narrative around Arun 
Siddharth's role in the party 
has become as clear as a foggy 
day in Jaffna.
As the saga unfolds, the political scene 
resembles a chessboard with pieces in disarray. 
With the UNP's upper echelons sending 
mixed signals, members and spectators are 
left scratching their heads. Is Arun Siddharth 
really the anointed organizer for the Jaffna 
District, or was the announcement as ill-timed 
as a monsoon wedding?
This episode, as viewed through the discerning 
eyes of political observers, unveils the 
labyrinthine maze of the UNP's internal 
politics, illustrating vividly a party often 
ensnared in its own tantalizing web of political 
manoeuvring and internal power plays.
But Arun seems unfazed. He wrote a Facebook 
post in Tamil, sharing newspaper articles and 
Facebook posts that criticized his appointment. 
His post was titled 'mr;rj;jpd; kWgf;fNk 
ntWg;G MFk;' (The Other Side of Fear is 
Hatred), which can be loosely translated as 
follows:
The seeds of the desert land possess a 
hundredfold strength because behind each seed 
lies the sorrow of countless seeds that perished, 
longing for life yet unable to find water. There's 
the eagerness of thousands of seeds that have 
meditated for just a drop of water. 
 
I have risen from the tears of the oppressed, 
chased from land to land for centuries. Isn't 
my success evident in the fact that everyone 
here is sizing me up? I can already see the 
smiles that will bloom in the hearts of many 
when I lose in the field. Isn't it delightful 
that they all await my failure? But that's not 
going to happen. Those with a single goal are 
destined to succeed. 
 
The other side of fear is hatred. Power is 
always hated by those who are weaker. But 
what is truly powerful naturally becomes a 
ruler. No one needs to make it so. 
 
The obstacles invigorate the mind of the 
strategist. It proclaims, 'Here is my arena!' and 
longs for more and more challenges. The more 
it is obstructed, the stronger it becomes. The 
more it is avoided, the faster it grows. He who 
steps on and climbs over obstacles is the one 
who reaches the peak of the mountain.
