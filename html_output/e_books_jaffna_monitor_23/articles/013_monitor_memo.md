T
he Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi 
(ITAK) is currently embroiled in 
a court-based leadership struggle and 
is facing new internal conflicts. The 
source of this turmoil is the party's 
ambitious newspaper venture, 'Puthiya 
Suthanthiran.' Initially meant to be 
ITAK's mouthpiece, its launch was a 
moment to highlight the party's voice 
and vision. However, the situation soon 
took an unexpected turn.
The individual who registered the 
newspaper, originally just a custodian, 
has now claimed ownership and 
exerted significant personal influence, 
catching ITAK off guard. Internal 
sources within ITAK firmly believe that 
Mavai Senathiraja, the former leader 
of the party, is orchestrating these 
developments.
The history of the newspaper dates 
back to 1947, representing the party's 
enduring legacy. Following the death 
of 'Thanthai' Selva, ITAK's founder, the 
control of the original 'Suthanthiran' 
newspaper shifted from the party to 
Selva's heirs. To resurrect this legacy, 
Mavai Senathiraja, leading the party in 
2018, relaunched 'Puthiya Suthanthiran.' 
It was registered in the name of a 
trusted associate of Mavai, backed by 
fundraising and party enthusiasm.

Promises to re-register the newspaper under 
Mavai's name, made during election times, 
eventually fell by the wayside. The situation 
intensified in 2020 when the publication 
suddenly ceased, only to resurface in February 
this year as a digital platform. The trusted 
individual evolved into a rogue publisher, 
portraying the revival of the newspaper as a 
personal achievement and distancing it from 
ITAK.
This development sparked 
heated debates within ITAK's 
political committee. While 
Mavai distanced himself 
from the current version of 
the newspaper, other notable 
members like Sumanthiran and 
Shritharan spoke out against 
its unauthorized publication. 
Dr. P. Sathiyalingam, the 
acting general secretary 
of ITAK, demanded an 
immediate cessation of 
'Puthiya Suthanthiran,' yet the 
publication continued.
During a recent party meeting, 
the leadership expressed their 
concerns about the newspaper 
being published without their 
approval. They concurred that 
the party should take measures 
to halt its unauthorized 
publication. Despite this, 
the newspaper is still being 
published contrary to their 
wishes.
This circumstance has led 
to considerable perplexity 
among the party's supporters 
and international financiers, 
prompting deliberations about future courses 
of action. While Mavai Senathiraja officially 
disassociated himself from the current 
publication activities during the political 
committee assembly, internal informants 
within ITAK harbor strong suspicions about 
his covert involvement. This suspicion 
resonates with his known reputation 
for cunning and strategic maneuvers, as 
characterized by party insiders. 
An early issue of ITAK's mouthpiece 'Suthanthiran'.
