Greetings,
In this issue, Jaffna Monitor, em-
barks on an exciting new journey, 
diverging from our traditional 
offerings to place a deeper focus on 
the local heartbeat and intellectual 
vibrancy of our community.
Our editorial board has collectively 
decided to halt the publication of 
our series temporarily - Anton 
Master Speaks, Mahathaya's Saga- 
and the interview with Karuna, the 
former LTTE military commander 
of the Eastern Province. This pause, 
though significant, reflects our un-
wavering commitment to bringing 
diverse narratives to the forefront. 
Rest assured, these popular series 
will return in our upcoming issues.
This edition showcases the ex-
emplary talents of our dedicated 
reporting team. Their work goes 
beyond mere reporting; it captures 
the very essence of our commu-
nity's spirit and dynamism. As the 
editor, their exceptional efforts fill 
me with immense pride.
In this issue, we are proud to pre-
sent a distinguished feature: a com-
pelling interview with Shobasakthi, 
the acclaimed writer and actor. 
Although our dialogue was concise 
owing to his commitments at the 
Paris Literary meeting, it offered a 
revealing glimpse into his extraor-
dinary literary acumen. It's im-
portant to note that while we have 
some concerns about the organiza-
tional approach and authoritarian 
tendencies of certain members of 
the literary meeting, these issues 
do not overshadow his substantial 
and influential contributions to the 
world of literature.
We also present a riveting piece 
by Dr. Aravinthan Arunthavana-
than, an esteemed sports writer. 
His article, "The Inside Story of the 
1996 India-Sri Lanka Semi-final," 
is more than a mere retelling of 
a historic cricket match. It delves 
deep into the spirit of a sport that 
bridges nations and unites hearts.
Adding to the richness of this edi-
tion is "Oru Ciṟuvaṉiṉ Katai" (xU 
rpWtdpd; fij) by the revered 
Sri Lankan Tamil writer A. Mut-
tulingam, elegantly translated by 
Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ. This story not 
only offers literary excellence but 
connects us with our cultural roots 
and heritage.
We value your opinions on this new 
direction and invite you to share 
your thoughts. Your feedback is 
instrumental in shaping the Jaffna 
Monitor's future. Please feel free to 
contact us at hellojaffnamonitor@

and direct call at +94715418220.
Let us continue this journey of ex-
ploration, discovery, and storytell-
ing together.
Warm regards,
