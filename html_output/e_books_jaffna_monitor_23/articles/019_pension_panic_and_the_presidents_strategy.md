Despite advocacy from Basil Rajapaksa, 
founder of the Podujana Peramuna (People's 
Front), and Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former 
President and a key figure in the party, for 
holding parliamentary elections before the 
presidential election, sources indicate that 
many within the party currently do not favour 
this approach.
This reluctance stems from a widespread belief 
among many members of parliament of the 
Podujana Peramuna that they are likely to face 
defeat in the next parliamentary elections. 
Such a defeat could result in the loss of their 
pensions.
Consequently, sources suggest there is a 
preference within the Podujana Peramuna 
to conduct the parliamentary elections only 
after the completion of the current term. This 
strategy aims to ensure the safeguarding of 
their pension funds, leading them to discreetly 
support the idea of holding a presidential 
election first.
As a result, they are sending envoys to the 
President to lobby for the presidential election 
to be prioritized. This move, which prioritizes 
party interests and pension funds, reflects the 
MPs of the Podujana Peramuna's adherence 
to traditional practices in Sri Lankan politics, 
where self-interest often comes before party or 
public interest.
The prevailing question is which option 
President Ranil Wickremasinghe prefers: 
a presidential race first or a parliamentary 
showdown? When we asked a political insider 
close to Ranil for the inside story, the answer 
was intriguing. 'It's all about the strategy!' he 
said. 'Imagine a parliamentary election first. 
Ranil will be in his running shoes, darting 
from one MP to another, imploring for their 
support.' However, he added that if the order 
is reversed to a presidential election first, and 
Ranil triumphs, it's a completely different 
scenario. Suddenly, MPs would be lining up, 
offering their most persuasive and obedient 
pledges to the newly empowered executive 
President. 'That's politics,' he said.
