n an address at the 11th National Convention of the 
Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) in 
Vavuniya, T. Siddharthan, leader of the People's Liberation 
Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) and Member of 
Parliament for Jaffna District, stressed the crucial need 
for a unified stance on the 13th Amendment. "The 13th 
Amendment, birthed from the India-Sri Lanka Accord, 
stands firm," he declared. "It's not a perfect solution, but 
it's essential that we come together in accepting it. Despite 
the opposition from many quarters."
Siddharthan then turned his attention to a troubling 
trend: the dwindling numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils in the 
North and East, a situation exacerbated by the increased 
ease of obtaining visas to countries like Canada and the 
UK. He pointed out that this year alone, approximately 
20,000 individuals have left Sri Lanka from these areas. 
In light of this exodus, he argued, embracing the 13th 
Amendment is not just a strategic move but a necessary 
one.
"Our focus must be on consolidating what we have and 
revitalizing the North and East. This approach is practical, 
not ideal. Our goal should always be to strive for the ideal 
while firmly grasping the realities at hand," he urged, 
countering the often unrealistic narratives spun by Tamil 
nationalist parties.
