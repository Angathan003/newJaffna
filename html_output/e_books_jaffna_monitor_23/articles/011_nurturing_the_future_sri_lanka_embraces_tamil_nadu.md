S
ri Lanka's recent implementation 
of a school meal program, 
inspired by the pioneering efforts 
of Tamil Nadu, marks a significant 
advancement in educational and 
nutritional support for children. 
This initiative, launched in 2024 
on March 25th, is poised to benefit 
1.6 million students in grades 1 to 
5, offering free breakfast at 9,134 
government schools. The aim is to 
address nutritional deficiencies, 
enhance school attendance, promote 
healthy eating habits, and elevate 
academic performance while also 
celebrating local culinary traditions.
The origins of such school meal 
programs trace back to Tamil Nadu, 
India, a trailblazer in this realm. The 
Corporation of Madras, in 1925-26, 
launched a school lunch program 
as an immediate measure to combat 
malnutrition and avitaminosis

among children from economically disadvantaged families. 
This innovative scheme was designed as an incentive to 
improve school attendance for children from families earning 
less than Rsâ€”50 per month at the time.
Subsequently, Tamil Nadu saw a surge in voluntary and 
philanthropic efforts to establish free school lunch centers 
throughout the state. The school lunch program was 
reinvigorated in July 1956 as a "people's movement, by then 
chief minister k.kamarajar.
The government formally adopted and refined this program 
in November 1957, encouraging public and parental 
participation.
In 1955, during a teachers' 
conference in Chennai, then 
Chief Minister Kamaraj 
discussed the concept of 
providing free lunch to poor 
children in primary schools. 
Following debates and 
overcoming initial scepticism, 
the program was launched in 
Ettayapuram, the birthplace 
of the Tamil poet Bharathiar. 
Kamaraj famously stated, 
"Feeding at school is not new 
to us. We have been offering 
food to guests at home; now 
we seek to go to schools to 
provide food. This combines 
the merits of saving lives 
and providing education, 
and there is no task more 
important to me. Hence, I am 
prepared to set aside all other 
duties and actively participate 
in this lunch program." 
Under subsequent leaders 
like M.G. Ramachandran 
and during DMK's rule, 
the program expanded, 
introducing eggs and other 
nutritious elements into the 
school meals.
It's heartening to see Sri 
Lanka embark on a journey 
that has seen widespread 
success in Tamil Nadu. The 
adage "You can't educate 
a hungry child" rings 
particularly true in this 
context, highlighting the 
importance of this initiative.
