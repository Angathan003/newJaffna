himself as the first cricketer to 
score two centuries in the same 
Test match while batting at No. 
7 or below. This exceptional 
feat unfolded during the match, 
with Mendis notching up 102 in 
the first innings and surpassing 
that with a commanding 
164 in the second. His dual 
centuries were instrumental in 
establishing a formidable 511-
run target for Bangladesh.

achievement is amplified by its 
rarity in the extensive history of 
Test cricket. Mendis, alongside 
Dhananjaya de Silva—who

This milestone not only highlights Mendis's 
individual brilliance but also signifies his 
increasing significance in the Sri Lankan team.
Mendis's recent successes are the result of a 
journey characterized by immense talent and 
resilience. Initially overlooked by selectors and 
confined to a limited number of international 
matches, Mendis consistently demonstrated 
his calibre. His capacity to perform under 
pressure and his distinct skill set make him 
an indispensable member of the Sri Lankan 
squad.
In addition to his impressive batting skills, 
Mendis is also known for his unique 
ambidextrous bowling ability in cricket. 
Naturally a left-hander, he is adept at 
delivering both right and left-arm bowls. 
This rare capability makes him a dual threat 
on the field, comfortable and skilled in 
using both hands for batting and bowling. 
His ambidexterity adds a layer of versatility, 
making him a formidable player in any format 
of the game.
Even in its early phases, Mendis's career 
has shown remarkable promise. His stellar 
performance against Bangladesh rapidly 
elevates his status to that of an internationally 
acclaimed cricketer. His journey thus far 
showcases not just his personal talent but 
also mirrors the changing dynamics of 
contemporary cricket, where players who 
possess versatility and adaptability are highly 
prized. Mendis's rise from being an under-
recognized talent to achieving historic 
milestones in the sport is a testament to his 
perseverance, skill, and the true spirit of 
cricket.
