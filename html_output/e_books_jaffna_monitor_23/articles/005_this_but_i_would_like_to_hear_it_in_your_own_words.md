this, but I would like to hear it in 
your own words.
As you know, I am very passionate about 
acting. During my teenage years, I was deeply 
captivated by the acting skills of South Indian 
film actress Shoba. Her performances in 
movies like 'Pasi', 'Moodupani', and 'Azhiaatha 
Kolangal' were particularly enchanting to me. 
The first part of my pseudonym is a tribute 
to her name. The second part, 'Sakthi', was 
inspired by the poem 'Solladi Sivasakthi' by the 
esteemed poet Subramania Bharathi, which 
resonated strongly with me. 
Despite the LTTE's significant 
influence and Prabhakaran's 
adulation during a crucial period for 
Sri Lankan Tamils, you remained 
critical, especially of their violent 
tactics. How did you foresee their 
eventual downfall at Mullivaikal 
when they were at their peak?
There are several reasons. Due to the fascist 
actions of the Tigers, they became alienated 
from the people. Especially after the 1990s, 
they completely abandoned the qualities of a 
liberation movement, and Prabhakaran turned 
into merely a warlord. 
The Tigers desired war until the end. People, 
weary from the war, did not want it. If the 
people had desired war, the Tigers would not 
have had to engage in forced conscription, nor 
would there have been a need to implement a 
pass system to prevent people from leaving the 
northern areas.
The conflict with the Indian Army, culminating 
in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, were key 
military factors that led to the downfall of the 
Tigers. After the 2001 Twin Towers attack in 
America and the changing global situation, 
I believed that these would accelerate the 
demise of the Tigers. The separation of Eastern 
Province fighters from the mainland LTTE also 
militarily weakened the Tigers. These various 
reasons were the basis for my prediction of the 
Tigers' downfall.
Following the 1983 ethnic riots, 
numerous militant groups emerged, 
a theme you explore in your 
short story 'The F group'. Amidst 
the formation of these various 
movements, what led you to choose 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE)? Weren't the Tigers fascists 
at that time? Or did you not have 
the life experience to recognize that 
fascism? Or did you join the Tigers 
due to a compulsion to be part of 
some movement?
The ethnic cleansing and oppressive tactics 
unleashed by the Sri Lankan chauvinistic 
government against the Tamil people were what 
spurred me to join the struggle for the liberation 
of Tamil Eelam. Among the movements 
that fought for Tamil Eelam's liberation, the 
Tigers' was actively and extensively involved in 
armed struggle, which led me to join them. I 
was 16 when I joined the Tigers and 19 when 
I left. At that age, I did not have the political 
understanding to realize the movement's true 
nature.
Why did you leave the Tigers 
organization? While you were a 
member, wasn't it necessary to take 
responsibility for the organization's 
fascist actions based on the concept 
of 'collective consciousness'?

The primary reason for leaving 
the Tigers organization was the 
tyrannical environment within 
the 
organization. 
Power 
was 
concentrated in the leadership, 
and we, as fighters, were led like 
flocks of sheep. I definitely accept 
responsibility for the mistakes 
made by the movement during the 
time I was active in it, based on 
collective conscience.
In an interview, you 
mentioned, "I was not 
merely an observer of the 
war; I actively participated 
in its unfolding. I 
persuaded my friends to 
join the movement, only 
to see them perish." How 
will you escape the guilt of 
this?
I cannot escape that guilt until my 
death.
You've said in an interview 
that facing trouble for your 
writing is an intimidation 
against a writer, not 
oppression against a 
fighter. You've moved 
past seeing yourself as a 
fighter, considering it an 
insult to true fighters. Yet, 
you've often identified as a 
child soldier, haven't you?
In that interview, I said, 'I am not 
a fighter now.' This does not mean

to hide the fact that I was a fighter in the LTTE 
in the past. In the early days of my writing, I 
had the notion of being a left-wing fighter. 
This belief was strengthened when I worked 
with the Trotskyist organization Fourth 
International' after coming to France. However, 
in recent times, I haven't been involved in any 
organizational work. I haven't found a political 
organization that aligns with my beliefs. 
Therefore, I focus only on my art and writing. 
So, I am not a fighter now. 
You've said, 'I don't oppose a 
nonexistent LTTE. I've moved on 
and now mock rather than seriously 
engage with those carrying the 
Tigers' ideology.' But considering the 
Tigers' ideology still exists, isn't it 
important to question its origins?
I believe that the basic ideology of the Tigers 
has been completely abandoned by their 
political supporters now. Nobody is putting 
forward the demand for an independent 
country anymore. This doesn't mean they have 
shifted to progressive politics; rather, they are 
involved in a different kind of worse politics. 
The Canadian Tamil Congress is an excellent 
example of this.
You are well-known for your strong 
critique of the caste system among 
Sri Lankan Tamils. In your view, 
what is the actual state of the caste 
dynamics in the regions inhabited 
by Sri Lankan Tamils?
The direct oppression and caste discrimination 
experienced by Sri Lankan Tamils during 
the 1960s and 70s have decreased, but they 
have not disappeared. The movement against 
untouchability significantly broke down the 
barriers of the caste system. The armed struggle 
has created a rupture in the caste structure 
and in the political and social contributions of 
women.
However, casteism, as a cultural and customary 
practice, is still deeply entrenched in the psyche 
of the dominant castes. Direct untouchability 
and 
caste-based 
discrimination 
remain 
widespread. Moreover, these practices are still 
prevalent there. In educational institutions, 
religious organizations, media, and alums 
associations, the mindset of the dominant 
caste and the ostracization of Dalits continue 
to occur. This has even spread to the diaspora 
also.
Some staunch Tamil nationalists 
claim that there is no casteism in 
the Tamil-inhabited areas of Sri 
Lanka now and that stories about

casteism are unnecessary. What's 
your view on this? Do you think 
casteism and Tamil nationalism are 
intertwined?  
I don't think that casteism and Tamil 
nationalism are intertwined in an ideological 
sense. Before our times, Dravidian movement 
leaders in Tamil Nadu, who once advocated for 
an independent state while emphasizing Tamil 
nationalism, were also intensely involved in 
the abolition of caste. Periyar E.V. Ramasamy 
argued that the demand for an independent state 
was primarily based on Brahmin dominance in 
the central government. 
I believe that casteism is intricately linked 
with Hinduism, a view also shared by Dr B.R. 
Ambedkar, who, after extensively studying 
the caste system, proclaimed, "I will not die a 
Hindu," and embarrassed Buddhism.
Our national liberation movements have indeed 
been indifferent to caste eradication. They 
opportunistically thought that emphasizing the 
abolition of the caste system would detract from 
their national liberation struggle. However, no 
national liberation movement was built on 
caste foundations. 
However, strong caste currents within electoral 
parties like the Tamil United Liberation Front 
and the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi were 
evident. 
At the same time, these caste inequalities were 
also present among electoral parties other than 
Tamil nationalist parties. Even the Communist 
parties cannot escape this accusation. In the
