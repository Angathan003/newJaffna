strength. Despite the Korean team's height 
advantage and swift, commanding start, the 
Sri Lankan players showcased exceptional 
skill and resilience. Their strategic play 
and unwavering determination led to a 
notable victory in this highly competitive 
international tournament.
Despite facing a formidable opponent, 
the Sri Lankan team maintained their 
composure, displaying relentless drive and 
precision in their shooting and offensive 
manoeuvres. Their effective execution at 
the free-throw line played a crucial role in 
turning the tide of the game. 
What is 3x3 
Basketball?
3x3 Basketball, often written as 3x3 or 
three-on-three, is an innovative and 
exciting variant of traditional Basketball. 
This format offers a more dynamic 
and fast-paced gameplay experience, 
primarily due to its reduced team size and 
playing area. Here are some of the key 
characteristics and differences from the 
standard basketball game:
Team Composition: In 3x3 
Basketball, each team is comprised of three 
players on the court, a significant reduction 
from the standard five in traditional 
Basketball. This smaller team size leads 
to a game that's faster and more personal, 
as players often find themselves in direct 
competition with their opponents.
Playing Field: The game is played 
on a half-court, with one hoop instead 
of two. This setup is reminiscent of street 
basketball and enhances the pace and 
intensity of the game. The smaller court 
demands quick transitions between offence 
and defence, putting players' versatility to 
the test.
Scoring System: Scoring in 3x3 
Basketball differs slightly from the 
traditional game. A shot made from inside 
the three-point arc (the same as the two-
point line in standard Basketball) is worth 
two points, and a shot from outside the

In a pivotal moment, with time running 
out, Pawan Gamage's dynamic penetration 
towards the basket forced the Korean 
defence to buckle. Demonstrating astute 
awareness, Gamage cleverly passed the 
ball to Dasun Nilantha, who executed a 
flawless jump shot from the short corner, 
clinching a hard-earned 21-19 victory for 
Sri Lanka. This strategic play marked the 
most significant upset of the tournament, 
showcasing the team's tactical acumen and 
fighting spirit.
Until the time of this news report, Sri Lanka 
had remained unbeaten in the competition, 
winning all three of their games. Their 
first win was against another strong side, 
Indonesia, with a score of 21-14. The game 
against Mongolia was scheduled for April 
29 at 12:10 pm Sri Lanka time, while the 
fixture against Thailand was set for 6:05 
pm. The national team has made significant 
progress in the sport's condensed format 
over the years.
The 3x3 arm of Sri Lankan basketball is a 
well-organized unit with regular events. 
Sports analysts say that international 
exposure could help the team reach new 
heights. The Sri Lankan 3x3 team represents 
several parts of the country, showcasing the 
widespread talent nationwide. 
While Rukshan Atapattu and Pawan 
Gamage are from Colombo, Simron 
Yoganathan hails from Jaffna, and Dasun 
Nilantha is from Ambalangoda. Atapattu 
is an undergraduate at the University of 
Moratuwa, Gamage serves in the Sri Lanka 
Army, Yoganathan works at Commercial 
Credit, and the Ministry of Education 
employs Dasun. Tharindu Fernando is the 
coach of the team.
arc is worth one point. This scoring system 
adds an extra tactical dimension to the 
game.
Duration and Game Format: A 
typical 3x3 game lasts for 10 minutes or 
until a team scores 21 points, whichever 
comes first. This shorter duration makes 
each game a high-energy and high-
stakes affair. If the score is tied at the end 
of regulation time, the game goes into 
overtime, where the first team to score two 
points wins.
Ball Size: The ball used in 3x3 Basketball 
is slightly smaller and lighter than a 
standard basketball, tailored to the game's 
unique style and faster pace.
Global Recognition and 
Competitions: 3x3 Basketball has 
gained significant recognition worldwide. 
It's governed by FIBA, the international 
basketball federation, and made its 
Olympic debut in the Tokyo 2020 Games. 
This exposure has helped it grow rapidly 
in popularity, both at the amateur and 
professional levels.
Accessibility: One of the appealing 
aspects of 3x3 Basketball is its accessibility. 
It requires fewer players, making it easier to 
organize games. The smaller court size also 
means that it can be played in more varied 
and smaller spaces, making it a popular 
urban sport.
Skills and Strategy: In 3x3 
Basketball, players must be skilled in 
various aspects of the game. The rapid pace 
and constant action require excellent ball 
handling, shooting, and defensive skills, as 
well as a high level of physical fitness.
