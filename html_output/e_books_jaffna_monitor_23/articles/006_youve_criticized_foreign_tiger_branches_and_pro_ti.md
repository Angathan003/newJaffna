northern region, despite the Communist Party receiving 
significant support from Dalit communities, there has 
been criticism that no Dalit has ever been able to ascend 
to a leadership position within the party.
You've criticized foreign Tiger branches 
and pro-Tiger Indian politicians for not 
properly commemorating Prabhakaran. 
Now, Prabhakaran's elder brother, 
Manoharan, has announced that he will 
organize a commemoration event for his 
brother's family, including Prabhakaran. 
What are your thoughts on this?
There's a need for the foreign branches of the Tigers 
to maintain the illusion that Prabhakaran is still 
alive. This is how they can keep control of the 
Tigers' assets, enjoy the taste of power, and 
collect money from the people in the name 
of Prabhakaran.
I 
think 
Prabhakaran's 
brother 
Manoharan doesn't have these needs. 
To him, Prabhakaran is not a leader 
but a younger brother, and theirs is a 
family of religious faith. Therefore, 
they engage sincerely in rituals like 
memorial services.
Why is there so much 
violence in your stories?
I 
have 
personally 
witnessed, 
experienced, and overcome such 
extreme

Portraying 
violence in stories depends on the 
choice of the narrative tool. 
At the same time, depicting violence 
in my stories is essentially about 
portraying the perpetrators of 
violence, exposing them. When
