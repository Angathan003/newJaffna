Dear Esteemed Readers,
Happy New Year! As we step into a new year filled with hope and ambition, I am 
thrilled to present to you an issue of the Jaffna Monitor that promises to be both 
thought-provoking and enlightening.
This edition embarks on a deep dive into the complex saga of Mahathaya, a fig-
ure who once stood as the deputy leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE). As we approach the 29th anniversary of Mahathaya's execution on Decem-
ber 28, 1994, we bring you a narrative enriched with unique perspectives and untold 
stories.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our invaluable sources – former members of the 
LTTE who now reside in Sri Lanka and various parts of the world. Their first-hand 
accounts and provision of rare photographs have been instrumental in bringing 
depth and authenticity to our coverage. Their contributions underscore the power of 
shared history and the significance of diverse narratives.
We also have the honour of featuring "Kapṭaṉ" (fg;ld;), a literary masterpiece 
by the esteemed Sri Lankan Tamil writer Shobasakthi, expertly translated by 
Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ (vOj;Jf;fpdpatd;). We sincerely thank Shobasakthi for allowing 
us to share his work and Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ for his exceptional translation skills. Due 
to its extensive narrative, this captivating story will continue in our next edition.
In our sports section, Dr Aravinthan Arunthavanathan, a renowned cricket writer, 
presents a fascinating article that intertwines the cricket world with invaluable lead-
ership lessons. His unique perspective offers our readers a fresh look at sports and 
leadership, adding another layer to our diverse stories.
Your overwhelming response to our transition from a monthly to a fortnightly 
publication has been incredibly heartwarming. Your calls, emails, and messages 
brimming with congratulations and encouragement have been a source of immense 
motivation for our team. We are deeply grateful for your unwavering support and 
engagement.
Our commitment to journalistic integrity remains stronger as we continue on 
our journey. We are dedicated to delivering stories that are informative, stimulate 
thought, and contribute to a deeper understanding of our world.
Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. Here's to a year filled with in-
sightful storytelling and shared discoveries.
Warm regards,

In a stunning display of musical talent and cultural 
resonance, Kilmisha Yaazhisai from Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 
has made history with her victory in "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa 
Little Champs Season 3" on Zee Tamil. This triumph 
is not merely a personal accolade but a historic event, 
potentially marking the first time a Sri Lankan has 
emerged victorious in an Indian reality TV show.
Affectionately termed the 'musical nightingale' of 
Jaffna, Kilmisha's journey is steeped in inspiration. 
Born to Kilson, a businessman and social worker 
from Ariyalai, and Tharmini from Uruthirapuram, 
Kilinochchi, her upbringing in a culturally vibrant 
environment was instrumental in her musical 
development. Her initial training with Mrs. 
Kamalojini Umasankar and subsequent guidance at 
Jaffna's Melodious Nightingale

the local Temple and from the Ariyalai Saranga Music 
Group was pivotal in honing her as a compelling 
vocalist.
Kilmisha's path to success, underpinned by 
unwavering support from her family, the Kalaimagal 
community, and relatives, is a testament to her innate 
talent and determination. Her debut song, "Kuyil party 
oh. Vandhadhenna laminae," set the tone for a series 
of spellbinding performances, culminating in her well-
earned victory and a prize of 10 lakh Indian Rupees.
Her return to Jaffna was met with an extraordinary 
celebration, a testament to her significant impact on 
the Jaffna Tamil community. The grand welcome she 
received at Palali Airport and the subsequent parade 
to her village in Ariyalai were reminiscent of a royal 
procession, seldom seen in Jaffna. The community's 
gesture of welcoming her with a palanquin near 
Ariyalai was particularly symbolic of the high regard 
in which she is held.
The response to Kilmisha's victory, while varied on 
social media, highlights a profound shift in societal 
attitudes. Amidst the celebrations, some voices urged 
her to balance her burgeoning music career with 
academic pursuits. Coming from a marginalized 
background, Kilmisha's triumph is more than just a 
musical victory; it is a beacon of hope, symbolizing 
that talent and perseverance can indeed overcome 
societal barriers.
Kilmisha Yaazhisai's success 
transcends the bounds of 
mere musical competition. 
It embodies a narrative of 
cultural unity, resilience, and 
the transformative power of 
music. As Jaffna's 'musical 
nightingale,' she has not only 
captivated millions with her 
melodious voice but also 
stands as an emblem of hope 
and progressive change in the 
musical landscape.
