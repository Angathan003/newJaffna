The Mahathaya Chronicle
Dear Readers,
Within the complex history of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the story of Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja, better known as Mahathaya, stands 
out distinctly. His journey from the heights of LTTE 
leadership, where he was celebrated as the deputy 
leader and a charismatic figure within the group, to his 
abrupt and dramatic downfall epitomizes the volatile 
nature of power and destiny in the organization's 
tumultuous narrative. Mahathaya's life story is a vivid 
illustration of rapid ascension followed by an equally 
swift decline.
In the following pages, we delve into the captivating 
story of Mahathaya, which, in turn, unfolds a 
significant part of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam's (LTTE) history. This organization has 
played a pivotal role in shaping the modern history 
of Sri Lanka. Mahathaya's journey within the LTTE 
is not just a personal narrative; it serves as a vivid 
illustration of the intricate dynamics of power and 
destiny that permeated the organization. Through his 
story, we aim to unravel the complex layers of the 
LTTE's history, offering insights into its influential 
role in the region's tumultuous past.
Mahathaya's story is marked by a meteoric rise and 
an equally rapid fall. After joining the LTTE in 1978, 
he quickly ascended to its zenith as its deputy leader. 
However, in August 1993, Mahathaya faced a stark 
reversal of fortune. In a shocking turn of events, the 
LTTE, the very group he had dedicatedly served, 
arrested him on grave accusations. These accusations

included allegedly colluding with India's Research 
and Analysis Wing (RAW) to assassinate Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, the LTTE's controversial leader, and 
other key members.
This feature aims to provide a balanced view of 
Mahathaya's significant yet ultimately tragic role 
within the LTTE. While recognizing his involvement 
in acts marked by violence and criminality, reflecting 
the brutal nature of the group's struggle, our narrative 
also sheds light on the leadership dynamics within the 
LTTE. We explore how leaders maintained relevance 
and proximity to Prabhakaran, often through flattery 
and internal politicking.
The story of Mahathaya is not just a recounting of 
past events but a lens through which we examine the 
multifaceted nature of the LTTE. We seek neither 
to glorify nor vilify Mahathaya or the LTTE but to 
present a nuanced understanding of his character 
and the organization he helped lead. His journey, 
culminating in his execution on December 28, 1994, 
remains a poignant chapter in the LTTE's history.
Given the extensive scope of this article, we have 
divided it into two parts. The first part, presented in 
this issue, lays the groundwork for understanding 
Mahathaya's rise and fall. The continuation, to be 
featured in our next issue, promises more insights into 
the LTTE's internal workings and the complex legacy 
of its leaders.
We invite you to engage with this comprehensive 
examination, which we believe will offer a deeper 
understanding of the LTTE, revealing the often 
unspoken and darker sides of its history and 
operations.
Thank you for your continued engagement with our 
publication.
Sincerely,
fzpad; G+q;Fd;wd;
