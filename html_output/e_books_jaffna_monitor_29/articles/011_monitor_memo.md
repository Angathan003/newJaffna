S
ri Lanka's recent decision to impose an 18% VAT 
on locally produced software, effective from April 
2023, marks a significant shift from its previous 0% 
rate. This move, part of a broader tax reform, has 
stirred concerns among industry insiders about its 
impact on Sri Lanka's goal of becoming a tech hub 
akin to Silicon Valley.
Sources indicate that the CEO of a well-known taxi-
hailing app company expressed concerns about the 
VAT, suggesting that it might compel Sri Lankan 
software companies to move their startups overseas, 
where they wouldn't face similar tax liabilities. This 
sentiment is shared across the industry, with many 
pointing out that the VAT is just one of several factors 
influencing such decisions. Ongoing issues like power 
outages and better job opportunities abroad have been 
driving factors in this trend.
The rationale behind the VAT imposition and its 
potential effects on the IT sector have been topics 
of heated discussion. Some experts argue that while 
seeking financial equilibrium, the government 
must also consider the impact of such taxes on 
the burgeoning tech industry. They highlight that 
Sri Lanka's tax policy changes have been frequent 
compared to other countries known for their tech 
industries.
For instance, tech hubs like Ireland and Singapore 
have thrived partly due to their favorable tax policies. 
Ireland's low corporate tax rate has attracted major 
tech firms, while Singapore offers a variety of 
incentives to nurture its tech sector. These countries 
provide examples of how supportive tax environments 
can foster technology innovation and growth.
In contrast, Sri Lanka's new VAT policy on software 
could potentially hinder the growth of its tech sector. 
Technical consultants and industry experts urge 
the government to focus on creating a supportive 
ecosystem for tech startups. This includes not only tax 
policies but also infrastructural support and a stable 
business environment. They emphasize that Sri Lanka 
is competing in a global market, where other countries 
are also vying to become IT hubs.
As Sri Lanka heads towards its next review of the VAT 
policy in 2024, the government faces the challenge 
of finding a balance. The decision on VAT will not 
only impact revenue generation but will also play a 
crucial role in determining the country's position in 
the global technology landscape. The success of Sri 
Lanka in becoming a South Asian Silicon Valley will 
significantly depend on how these policies evolve and 
support the tech industry's growth.
