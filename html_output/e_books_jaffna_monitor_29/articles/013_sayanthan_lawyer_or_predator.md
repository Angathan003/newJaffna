A young man previously arrested under the stringent provi-
sions of the Terrorism Prevention Act was granted bail by the 
Chavakachcheri Magistrate's Court on December 28. His arrest on 
November 27 in Kodikamam during the Maaveerar Day commemo-
ration occurred because he was wearing a T-shirt featuring the im-
age and emblem of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the infamous leader of 
the LTTE.
The case initially met with a stern response from the authorities but 
saw a shift when the Attorney General's Department consented to 
the youth's release on bail. Tharmakulasingam Anjanan, represent-
ing him in court, successfully argued for his release. However, this 
legal victory was overshadowed by a controversial episode involving 
former Provincial Council member and Tamil National Alliance 
member Sayanthan.
Following the arrest, the youth's parents, in a desperate bid to secure 
their son's release, sought assistance from Minister Douglas De-
vananda. They shared a distressing account of their interactions 
with Sayanthan, who, despite publicly inciting support for the LTTE 
cause, allegedly exploited their plight by 
demanding a hefty fee of 20,000 rupees for 
his legal services. The financially struggling 
family had to pawn their jewelry to meet this 
demand.
The irony of Sayanthan's actions sparked 
widespread outrage, mainly as the story 
unfolded. A video of the youth's parents 
discussing the incident with Minister De-
vananda went viral on social media, leading 
to public indignation. Accusations flew thick 
and fast against lawyer-politicians like Say-
anthan, suggesting ulterior motives in their 
actions. There were allegations that they 
were inciting innocent youths into arrestable 
activities as part of a profitable scheme. This 
incident has raised serious ethical questions 
about those who claim to defend a cause 
only to exploit those they purport to repre-
sent.

Story
In January of the year Nineteen Hundred and Ninety One, 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam nicknamed Manuel 
Poṉrāsā as ‘Captain.’  This incident unfolded thus:
In June of Nineteen Ninety, Tigers had laid siege to Jaffna 
fort. Hundreds of government army soldiers were caught 
inside the fort. Tigers had cut off all supply lines to the 
fort. They were trying to scale the fort walls using light 
cranes. There was a secret passage to enter the fort from 
the sea.  Tigers on small boats tried to breach the fort via 
this secret passage. Tiger artillery kept on pounding the 
fort walls and perforating them. It was a battle of life and 
death for the soldiers. They fought day and night to defend 
the fort. In July, two helicopters that attempted to airdrop 
food and medicines were shot down by two Tigers. By 
the middle of August, having completely depleted their 
ammunition and food stocks, it appeared that the army 
had no option other than to surrender to Tigers. The day 
after the Red Cross had informed the government that they 
would facilitate the arrangements for the surrender, rescue 
forces from the army landed by air and sea in Urāththuṟai, 
Captain PART 01

14 kilometers southwest of the fort. Those forces started 
slowly advancing towards the fort. Launching rockets, and 
dropping bombs from aircrafts, the army inched forward 
from Urāththuṟai.
Tigers had not anticipated that the army would land 
in Urāththuṟai. There was no other way to move their 
forces from Jaffna or Vaṉṉi to Urāththuṟai than by sea. 
The sea was already under the control of the Sri Lankan 
navy. Every inch of the sea was burning. The skeletal 
Tiger forces that were in Urāththuṟai started falling back, 
advising the people along the way, “run!”
Around midday that day, they entered the village of Suruvil 
and sped through in their vehicles telling, “the army will 
enter this village by tomorrow morning, run.” With the 
army at one end, the fort at the 
other, and the sea on either side, 
people scampered, looking for 
a fifth side. Two youths from 
Suruvil, twenty-year-old Christy 
and eighteen-year-old Bosco, went 
to their father and said, “aiyā, we 
are going to escape to India by 
boat.” Fear of life pervaded their 
faces.
Rubbing his left cheek with his 
right hand, Poṉrāsā regarded his 
sons intently. Finally, he declared, 
“there is no need, you can remain 
here, the army will not come 
here.”
The sons were overcome with 
sadness and disappointment. In 
their minds, it was a battle for life 
and death. Poṉrāsā’s nonchalant 
demeanor began to irritate them. 
The younger Bosco mustered some courage to assert, “the 
boys from the movement have told everyone to evacuate, 
the army will be here at any time.”
Poṉrāsā, who was standing on the front yard of the hut, 
sat on his haunches in the sand, and told his sons to do the 
same. He smoothed the sand with his hand and hurriedly 
started to draw a map. His scarred index finger tore through 
the sand to create lines. “This is Urāththuṟai, this is where 
the army has landed now,” his finger zoomed to one end 
of the map. “This is the fort,” his finger zipped over to 
the other end. “The army will traverse the northern road, 
hugging the northern coast, via Karampaṉ, Nāranthaṉai, 
Saravaṇai, Arāli Junction, Maṇkumpāṉ, Allaippiddy, and 
Maṇdaitīvu Junction, to make their way to the fort. Their 
target is to reach the fort, not capturing you two weaklings. 
It is unlikely that they will turn left to reach Suruvil. Even 
if they do, I will protect you. I know Sinhala, I will talk to 
the soldiers,” said Poṉrāsā.
Christy, the elder boy, raised his voice slightly and said, 
“the soldiers will arrive in murderous rage; they will not 
talk to you, perhaps they will spare you because you are 
old, but they will kill us.” He turned to look at his mother 
who was sitting at the hut’s entrance. His eyes pleaded 
with her.
Poṉrāsā propelled himself up from the ground only using 
his strong legs. He cleared his throat noisily at length and 
spat out the phlegm. Then he asked haughtily in a voice 
tinged with a little anger, “how will you go to India? Will 
you swim all the way?”
The elder boy hung his head and said, “boats are leaving 
for India from Vēlaṉai’s Mukkuvathuṟai. They are charging 
three thousand rupees per person.” The younger boy piped 
up, his voice quavering, “the movement is charging two 
thousand rupees departure tax for each person leaving for 
India. If we have ten thousand rupees, we both will go to 
India.”
“Ten thousand! You have that kind of money?” Poṉrāsā 
asked flippantly. “Didn’t akkā send money?” muttered the 
elder boy.
“Oh, is that so! Your mother and I can give you that money 
and starve,” he said as he whipped off his shirt drying on 
the clothesline, draped it on his shoulder, folded his vēṭṭi at 
knee length, and left. He paused at the gate and called out

in a loud voice “dēy Christy, dēy Bosco, listen carefully… 
for twenty years I have protected you and raised you. I also 
know how to protect you going forward.” He put on his 
shirt standing on the street.
People thronged along Suruvil roads with their boxes and 
pots and pans in tow. The big question was where they 
should run to. They could not discover that fifth direction. 
The chatter was that they should walk four kilometers 
eastwards to seek refuge as a crowd at the Shrine of our 
Lady of Good Voyage in Chāddy, known as the Chāddy 
Māthā church. Poṉrāsā cursed them, “cowards who 
fear for their lives.” The people of that village generally 
did not want to cross Poṉrāsā. If there was ever a little 
quarrel or friction, Poṉrāsā would show up in front of 
his antagonist’s house every evening without fail to yell 
at them. If he was quarreling with two people at the same 
time, he would draw up a timetable and stick religiously to 
it, visiting the first enemy’s house after the morning toddy 
drink and the other enemy’s house after the evening drink. 
The villagers called him ‘exhausting’ Poṉrāsā because he 
wears them out.
When Poṉrāsā inquired how far the army had advanced, 
no one knew the answer. Poṉrāsā declared to those present 
that he would go find out and started walking westwards. 
No sooner did he go out of their view, than they started 
murmuring that ‘exhausting’ Poṉrāsā is going to capitalize 
on the fact that everyone had fled their houses, to steal 
coconuts or chickens from abandoned houses.

He entered the village of Saravaṇai and surfaced by the 
eighth mile post on the northern road. Until Saravaṇai, he 
encountered people occasionally. But the eighth milepost 
was completely empty. Notably, the fact that the toddy 
tavern at that junction was closed made him furious. With 
his strong leg, He forcefully kicked the empty barrel 
standing in front of the tavern. The barrel somersaulted 
thrice and fell on the ground.
As he walked eastwards through the paddy fields that 
nestled the northern road, the ground began to gradually 
disappear in the embrace of the reddish twilight of dusk. 
When he saw a bomber appear abruptly in the sky, he 
rushed to hide behind the lone palmyra tree. As the bomber 
circled, he, too, circled the palmyra. Suddenly the circling 
bomber disappeared. He then heard the sounds of bombs 
exploding over on the side of the northern sea.
Poṉrāsā came as far as Nāranthaṉai junction. People had 
already fled their houses. Although the sound of explosions 
was incessant, there was no sign of the army advancing. 
“The idiot Sinhalese are lighting crackers out of fear,” he 
mumbled to himself. He thought that the army was not 
going to advance anymore in darkness, they would resume 
at dawn. Poṉrāsā turned to walk back to the village of 
Suruvil. He lengthened his stride with his long legs, so that 
he could walk faster, thinking that he should tell everyone 
to sleep in their own homes overnight and reassess the 
situation in the morning.
When he reached Suruvil at around eight in the evening, 
the village was enveloped in darkness. Not a creature was 
stirring on the streets. He cleared his throat and spat out. 
Then he walked towards his hut. When he saw no light 
in the hut, he stood outside and called out to his wife, 
“Gñaṉammā… Gñaṉammā.” There was no response. 
With anger welling up inside him, he entered the hut 
and lit a lamp. The hut was empty. He could see that the 
bedding, bags, pots, and pans had all been taken away. He 
surmised that the mother and sons had gone to Chāddy 
Māthā church. When he thought of the fact that they fled 
despite his advice earlier that evening, he was incensed, 
burning up within and without. He rooted around the soil 
in the southern corner of the hut to retrieve the buried can. 
The money was intact. He reburied it tightly. He reached 
into the cadjan wall of the hut to fetch a bottle of arrack. It 
was half full. He drank one half of it in one gulp, wrapped 
the bottle up in a piece of paper, and hurried eastwards in 
search of his wife and sons. He told himself that he would 
intercept them while they were still on their way and beat 
them to pulp. The roads were deserted all the way. He 
entered some of the neighboring houses. They were empty, 
too. By the time he reached Chaddy Māthā church, it was 
eleven at night.
The church was full of people from the seven or eight 
neighboring villages. They lay down inside the church hall 
as well as outside on the sand. Cooking was in progress 
by the well behind the church. Poṉrāsā hurried through 
the crowd angrily, searching for his wife and children, 
murmuring from time to time through gritted teeth, “these 
promiscuous bastards, running around having abandoned 
their houses.” When he saw Gñaṉammā leaning against 
a pillar, he grabbed her by the arm and dragged her 
out. When they reached a darkened spot, he gave her a 
thundering slap across her cheek. She remained silent 
when he asked about the whereabouts of Christy and 
Bosco. When he grabbed her throat to strangle her, her 
neck was sticky with tears. Poṉrāsā jerked his hands away 
from her and growled, “where are Christy and Bosco?” 
She said, softly, “they have left for India.” Poṉrāsā slowly 
sat down on the sand. He took the bottle out of the paper 
wrapping and gulped the remaining arrack. Then he stood 
up, grabbed his wife’s hand and rushed back to the church.
In the church hall, Gñaṉammā gave him the rice parcel. 
Poṉrāsā fiddled with the rice, his brows furrowed, deep 
in thought. His eyes were red from anger and intoxication. 
“How did they get the money to go?”” he asked. “I gave 
them my four-sovereign gold chain,” said Gñaṉammā. 
When Poṉrāsā’s brawny hand slapped Gñaṉammā again, 
her face was caked with rice and gravy. “Give me your ear 
studs,” he held out his hands. Without a word, Gñaṉammā 
removed her ear studs with blue gemstones. Father 
Varapragāsam had gifted them to her when Poṉrāsā 
married Gñaṉammā. He held them out in his palms to 
inspect them, tucked them into his lap, and stood up to go 
out. He could sense that his feet were unsteady. He shook 
his head and started walking towards the south.
By the time Poṉrāsā arrived at Vēlaṉai Mukkuvathuṟai, 
it was past one in the morning. His sons had said that this 
was where the boats to India left from. The deserted beach 
basked in the late-night moonlight. He punched the ground 
a few times with his left foot, saying “Motherfuckers have 
left.” Then he paced up and down the shore a couple of 
times. Along the shore, in knee-deep water, a row of boats 
had been tied up. He looked around to see if there was 
anyone in any of the boats. He leapt into one of the boats 
to examine it. Inside the blue plastic boat, there were fish 
nets and support poles. The part where the engine would 
have been mounted, stood empty. The boatman must have 
anchored the boat on the shore and taken the motor with 
him.
Standing on the boat, he peered at the sky, working out the 
direction using the stars. Over in the northern sky, a row of 
stars stood in formation as if someone had drawn a straight 
line through them. He clearly saw the direction towards

India. He removed his shirt and held it up to flutter in the 
wind so that he could gauge the wind direction. The shirt 
fluttered northwards. He threw the fish nets overboard and 
hauled the anchor into the boat. Then he started driving 
the boat towards India by pushing with a quant pole. The 
boat appeared to move. But soon Poṉrāsā was exhausted. 
Sighing, ‘motherfucker, how do they drive this thing 
forward?’, he sat on the prow of the boat. Although he 
was not pushing with the quant pole, he observed that the 
boat was still moving at a moderate pace. He stood up to 
place the two quant poles on the prow, and with herculean 
effort tied them up firmly using a rope he found so that 
they stood parallel to each other. He removed his vēṭṭi and 
tied it across the poles as a makeshift sail. Now the boat 
moved rapidly in the direction of the wind. He sat on the 
prow, lit a cigar, and peered northwards into the black 
night. He resolved to himself that he would not return to 
Sri Lanka from India without his sons Christy and Bosco. 
When he felt thirsty, he did not regret having forgotten to 
bring water. Instead, he scooped up sea water and gargled 
with it. He secreted the blue-gem ear studs into the inside 
of hi s underwear, fearing that someone might filch it when 
he landed in India. As he had heard that once you passed 
Kachatīvu, you could see the light from the Rāmēswaram 
temple tower, he waited for this light to appear. He felt 
nauseous, his breath reeking of arrack. This was his first 
long sea voyage. He had heard that one’s first voyage 
is typically accompanied by nausea. So, he was not too 
worried. But he felt his head spin. The retch that emerged 
from his mouth had the stench of arrack. He leaned back 
on the prow and fell asleep without realizing it.
