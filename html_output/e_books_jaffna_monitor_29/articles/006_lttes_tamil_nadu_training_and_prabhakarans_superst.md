LTTE's Tamil Nadu Training and 
Prabhakaran's Superstitions
The first two batches of LTTE training in India were 
conducted by the Indian government. Following 
these, the LTTE organized seven additional training 
batches in Tamil Nadu. These sessions were led by 
trainers, referred to as 'masters' in LTTE parlance, who 
themselves had been trained during the initial batches 
overseen by Indian authorities. Notably, the first batch 
of these LTTE-conducted sessions (the third batch 
overall), along with the 6th and 10th batches, took 
place in Kumbarapatti, a small mountain hamlet in the 
Kolathur area of Salem district. Over time, this village, 
Kumbarapatti, became known as 'Puliyur' – meaning 
'village of the tigers' in Tamil – a name that emerged as 
a tribute to the LTTE training camps established there.
The 4th and 7th batches of LTTE training took place 
in Sirumalai, Dindigul, at an estate owned by a close 
aide of Pazha Nedumaran, Dindigul Alagirisamy. The 
5th and 9th batches were conducted in Rajapalayam 
Koomapatti. Notably, the 7th batch was exclusively for 
women. An interesting aspect of these training batches 
is that they were numbered from 1 to 10, yet there 
were only nine batches in total. This is because there 
was no 8th batch. The omission of the 8th batch was 
due to Prabhakaran's superstition; he considered the 
number 8 unlucky. Sources told the Jaffna Monitor that 
this belief was firmly held by the LTTE supremo until 
the 1990s. Sources who were part of these training 
batches informed the Jaffna Monitor that Mahathaya 
did not participate in any of these sessions.
This lack of formal military training was not unique 
to Mahathaya. Other prominent LTTE figures, such 
as Baby Subramaniam, the Head of the Tamil Eelam 
Education Department; Col. Shankar, founder of the 
LTTE's air wing and marine division; Anton Master, 
former head of Military Office (MO) and Nadeshan, 
the LTTE's Political wing Leader, also reportedly did 
not participate in formal training camps. Like these 
individuals, Mahathaya was thrust into military ranks 
within the LTTE without undergoing conventional 
military training. However, it is understood that these 
individuals, including Mahathaya, received military 
training in some form somewhere.
