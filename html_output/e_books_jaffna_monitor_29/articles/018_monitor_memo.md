Monitor Memo
Geethanath's 
Mission Impossible
for the world economy, which is already 
in a precarious state. According to Fitch 
Ratings' latest Global Economic Outlook 
Report, the world's growth is expected 
to plummet to 2.1% in 2024, impacted 
by monetary tightening, China's prop-
erty downturn, and the stagnation of the 
eurozone economy. Developing countries, 
including Sri Lanka, currently facing a 
severe economic crisis, would be hardest 
hit by a global economic downturn.
The risk of the new COVID-19 variant 
spreading to Sri Lanka is real, particularly 
given its proximity and interactions with 
India, where the variant is already present. 
Initially, COVID-19 infections tend to be 
sporadic, but they can escalate rapidly, 
leading to waves of cases that might neces-
sitate drastic measures like lockdownsâ€”
something Sri Lanka can ill-afford amid 
its economic turmoil.
Health experts in Sri Lanka are advocat-
ing for public mask-wearing, a sensible 
precaution. However, mere advisories may 
not suffice. The Sri Lankan health authori-
ties need to swiftly evaluate the situation 
and take decisive actions, potentially mak-
ing mask-wearing mandatory again and 
resuming COVID testing while ensuring 
transparency and avoiding corruption, 
which has plagued the Health Ministry in 
the past.
In these trying times, politicians must 
refrain from exploiting the crisis for 
their own ends, such as delaying elec-
tions under the guise of public health. The 
country's economic recovery, achieved at 
a tremendous social cost, could quickly 
unravel in the face of a national health 
emergency, further straining the already 
overburdened state coffers and healthcare 
system. The previous government's down-
fall was significantly influenced by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, a history Sri Lanka 
cannot afford to repeat. 
Geethanath Kassilingam, previously serving as the Coordina-
tor Secretary for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and 
a close ally of Rajapaksa's son Namal, has been appointed to 
the Central Committee and Political Bureau of the Sri Lanka 
Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) amidst the party's latest restruc-
turing. A Jaffna Tamil, born in Jaffna and raised in Colombo, 
Known for his school ties with Namal, Geethanath is step-
ping into a crucial role at a time when the party, known for 
its staunch Sinhala nationalist stance, is grappling with lost 
credibility in Sinhala regions due to the economic blunders of 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa during his presidency.
Geethanath has been given a task akin to selling meat dur-
ing the Nallur Temple festival. His mission? To ramp up the 
party's charm in the Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern 
provinces, where SLPP's support is as scarce as good govern-
ance in Maithripala Sirisena's 'Yahapalana' (good governance) 
government. 
With such a slim fan base in these Tamil-speaking areas, 
Geethanath's role is as challenging as finding a needle in a 
haystack. But considering his background as the Prime Minis-
ter's Special Representative for Rehabilitation Issues there, he 
might have the right strategies up his sleeve. It's a wait-and-see 
game to determine if he can make the improbable happen.
