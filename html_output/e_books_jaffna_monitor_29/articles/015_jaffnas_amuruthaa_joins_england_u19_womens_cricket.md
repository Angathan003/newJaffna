The England Women's Under-19 cricket team is set to embark on 
a tour of Sri Lanka in March-April 2024, where they will compete 
in a Tri-Series against the host nation and Australia. The series 
will feature T20 and 50-over formats, with further details on dates 
and venues to be confirmed later. A significant highlight of the 
series is the inclusion of Amuruthaa Surenkumar, a Tamil woman 
of Sri Lankan descent from Jaffna, in the England squad. This 
announcement marks a historic moment, as Amrutha is the first 
woman from Jaffna to be selected for an international women's 
cricket team. Her father, Surenkumar, is a former cricketer from 
St. John's, renowned for his record-breaking individual score of 
145 runs in the Jaffna Big Match against Jaffna Central College. 
In 2021, at the young age of 14, Amuruthaa achieved a remarkable 
feat by becoming the youngest player ever selected for an 
academy squad in the new regional women's cricket competition. 
This competition involved eight teams from across England. 
Amuruthaa was chosen from a pool of 100 nominated players to 
join the inaugural Sunrisers Academy. This academy is part of 
a hub representing nine counties throughout London, the East, 
and the MCC, catering to players up to 19. Her selection into this 
prestigious academy was a significant milestone in her cricketing 
journey, paving the way for her current achievement as the first 
woman from Jaffna to be selected for an international women's 
cricket team.

Dr. Aravinthan Arunthavanathan 
is a multi-talented professional, renowned in 
both medicine and cricket writing. A graduate 
of Colombo Medical Faculty, he contributes 
significantly to the pharmaceutical industry, 
focusing on Medical Marketing and Business 
Development. He is also known in Sri Lanka 
as a cricket writer, particularly for his Twitter 
analyses @Cricket_decoded. Additionally, he is a 
proficient public speaker with interests in cognitive 
sciences, medical, and management education. His 
blend of scientific knowledge, sports insight, and 
communication skills distinguishes him in both 
medical and sports domains. 
The image of Cummins, metaphorically 
roaring like a pleasant lion against a sea of 
blue, speaks volumes. It represents not just 
a pivotal cricketing moment but also his 
journey as a leader and the way he has faced 
challenges.
In describing Cummins, 'roaring like a 
pleasant lion' is paradoxically apt. He 
embodies an unconventional Australian spirit, 
making him both admirable and relatable. 
Beyond his charismatic appearance, he is a 
visionary, capable of transforming the image 
of Australian Cricket, aligning with the 
aspirations of its board.
The respect he has garnered was evident when 
the Barmy Army, traditionally fierce rivals, 
paid tribute to Cummins's ailing mother. It 
underscores the profound impact Cummins 
has had, bridging divides and earning respect 
from even the most unlikely quarters.
