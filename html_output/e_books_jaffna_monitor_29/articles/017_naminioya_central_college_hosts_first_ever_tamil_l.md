school's Tamil language students, was 
orchestrated under the expert guidance 
of Matale Suneetha Thero, a Tamil 
Buddhist monk dedicated to fostering 
cross-cultural understanding.
The festival was a vibrant tapestry of 
Tamil culture, featuring activities like 
Pongal celebrations, Bharatanatyam 
dance performances, and melodious 
Tamil songs. The participation of all 
1,200 students at the school in these 
events was a testament to the school's 
commitment to cultural exchange and 
an eye-opener for Sinhala students. For 
many, it was their first immersion into 
the rich heritage of Tamil culture.
Adiyar Vipulanada Swamy, a Saiva 
Swami from Jaffna, participated as the 
chief guest.

A pivotal moment of the event was when Matale Suneetha 
Thero addressed the gathering. He underscored the 
importance of exposing Sinhala students to Tamil culture, 
asserting that such initiatives are crucial for cultivating 
understanding and peace between Tamil and Sinhala 
communities. He advocated for the replication of this 
event in Sinhala schools and called for Tamil schools to 
celebrate Sinhala cultural events similarly. In a poignant 
remark, Matale Suneetha Thero observed that adherence to 
the values of Buddha could be the key to resolving ethnic 
tensions in the country.
This Tamil Language Festival at Naminioya Central 
College was more than just a celebration of language and 
culture; it was a bold statement on the power of education 
and cultural activities in bridging community divides. The 
event set a precedent, hoping to inspire other schools across 
Sri Lanka to embrace such initiatives. As a celebration 
of unity and understanding of Sri Lankan diversity, the 
festival illuminated the path towards a more cohesive and 
peaceful society.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised 
alarms about an uptick in respiratory diseases, includ-
ing COVID-19 and its new sub-variant JN.1, particu-
larly in Southeast Asia. This new variant, classified as 
a variant of interest due to its swift global spread, has 
made its way to various states in India. The mutation 
is believed to have increased the virus's ability to evade 
immunity, sparking significant concern among public 
health experts. Yet, there's a consensus that there's no 
cause for panic as current vaccines appear effective in 
preventing severe illness and death.
In Singapore, the re-emergence of COVID-19 cases 
has led to the reinstatement of mask mandates. This 
move underscores the need for other countries to 
adopt similar preventative measures to combat this 
elusive virus. Sri Lanka, in particular, is urged to in-
tensify its response to this emerging health emergency 
and implement preventive strategies promptly, avoid-
ing its usual delays.
Another global outbreak of COVID-19 could be 
devastating, not just in terms of human lives but also
