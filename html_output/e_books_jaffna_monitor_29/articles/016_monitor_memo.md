Monitor Memo
SriLankan Airlines recently embarked 
on a mission to find the crème de la 
crème of air hostesses, and let's just 
say the criteria were... quite specific! 
Out of a whopping 6,000 hopefuls who 
dreamed of soaring the skies, only 196 
made the cut. Why? Well, Aviation 
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had a 
checklist: clear skin, an unblemished 
midriff (saree-ready, of course), and 
a mastery of English to chat up the 
passengers.
Picture the scene: a sea of applicants, 
each more eager than the last, only 
to be turned away for a tiny pimple 
or a mark on their midriff – ouch! 
The Minister, playing the role of a 
beauty and language guru, advised 
future applicants to start their pimple-
fighting regimen and English lessons 
practically in the cradle. He lamented 
that many, especially from rural areas, 
missed this memo early on.
The interview room must have been 
quite the stage, with candidates putting 
on their best show of beauty and 
eloquence. But alas, if your English 
wasn't up to snuff, you were out of 
the flying game. The Minister stressed 
that chatting and assisting passengers 
in English is a must in the high-flying 
world of air hostesses.
While SriLankan Airlines might not be 
the biggest contributor to the country's 
economy, Minister de Silva is keen to 
bump up those numbers. His recipe? 
Start young with your skincare and 
English books, and who knows, you 
might just be the next star of the skies!
