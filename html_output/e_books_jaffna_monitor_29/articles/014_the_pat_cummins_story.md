As the cricketing world moved on from the recently 
concluded World Cup, a defining image emerged. It was 
Pat Cummins, metaphorically roaring like a lion, albeit a 
pleasant one, after dismissing Virat Kohli. This moment, 
set against a backdrop of stunned fans clad in blue, 
captured the essence of the tournament.
Pat Cummins is indeed a paradox, much like the phrase 
'roaring like a pleasant lion.' He stands out among 
contemporary cricketers, not just for his skills but also 
for his demeanour. With the looks of a James Bond 
protagonist, Cummins naturally commands attention. His 
unexpected elevation to the leadership of the Australian 
team brought an unforeseen impact. This was during a time 
when Cricket Australia was keen on improving its image, 
especially following the controversial departure of Tim 
Paine. Cummins, a fast-bowling captain, is a rarity and 
often faces unique challenges. His journey so far has been 
marked by significant hurdles, yet how he has navigated 
these challenges has set him apart, reshaping what it means 
to be an Australian cricketer.

Cummins's leadership was truly tested with the dismissal of 
former coach Justin Langer. Facing criticism from cricket 
veterans, he chose to support his younger teammates, 
mirroring the solidarity shown by past Australian greats 
for Langer. His leadership shone through in both triumphs 
and thoughtful gestures, like being mindful of Usman 
Khawaja's presence during the Ashes victory celebration.
His leadership qualities were further evident in his defence 
of David Warner against criticisms from Mitchel Johnson, 
showcasing his unwavering support for his team. Warner's 
subsequent performance in Perth, scoring a century 
against Pakistan, was a testament to the positive impact of 
Cummins's support.
Cummins's decision to prioritize national commitments 
over participating in the IPL 2023 was a significant move, 
especially considering the lucrative opportunities he 
forfeited. This decision is particularly influential in an era 
where many emerging players prioritize franchise cricket.
Cummins's handling of the World Cup final against 
India was exemplary. Choosing to bowl first, he defied 
conventional strategies, demonstrating a blend of courage 
and clear-headed strategy. His fast bowling masterclass, 
culminating in the dismissal of Kohli, was a dream-like 
execution of his plan. Notably, his pre-match media 
interactions showcased his ability to turn challenges to his 
team's advantage, exemplifying masterful leadership.
