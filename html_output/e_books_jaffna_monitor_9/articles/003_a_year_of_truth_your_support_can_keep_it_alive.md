A Year of Truth: Your Support 
Can Keep It Alive

his issue of Jaffna Monitor marks our first anniversary. In 
mid-October 2023, a small group of determined individuals 
united with a vision to launch an English magazine that 
amplifies the voices of the North and East of Sri Lanka. On 
November 1st, 2023, we released our first issue.
From the very beginning, we took a resolute stand not to seek 
donations or external funding, choosing instead to rely on the 
modest means at our disposal. Every article you’ve encountered 
is a product of relentless effort and devotion, free from external 
influence or hidden agendas—fueled solely by our steadfast 
commitment to authentic and fearless journalism.
Though a few generous individuals approached us with offers 
of donations, we redirected their support to our contributors, 
prioritizing the people behind the stories. However, now the 
reality is unavoidable: to keep Jaffna Monitor alive, we must 
ask for your help. We believe that over the past year, we have 
proven ourselves worthy of your trust—our actions and work 
speak louder than any appeal. But without sustained financial 
support, we stand on the brink of a difficult choice.
Some have suggested we introduce a paywall, restricting access 
to those who can afford it. But Jaffna Monitor was founded to 
serve the public, to amplify every voice—not to hide the truth 
behind subscriptions. Yet, without your support, continuing 
this mission at the same momentum becomes increasingly 
challenging.
In fact, we have turned down lucrative advertisements from 
presidential candidates during the last election. These offers—
though framed as simple ad placements—would have provided

not explicitly endorse a candidate, the message they convey is subtle yet 
undeniable. We will not risk even the slightest perception that we are aligned 
with any political figure or party. Our commitment to neutrality is non-
negotiable.
If Jaffna Monitor has informed, engaged, or inspired you, we ask for your 
support. But let us be absolutely clear: a donation is not a purchase of 
influence. We will never compromise our editorial independence in exchange 
for favors, no matter how generous the offer. Your support ensures our 
survival, but it will never shape our content.
The future of Jaffna Monitor lies in your hands. If you believe in independent 
journalism that refuses to bow to power, politics, or profit, stand with us. 
We have carried this mission forward for a year—with your help, we can 
continue it. Please donate,Your contribution will make all the difference.
