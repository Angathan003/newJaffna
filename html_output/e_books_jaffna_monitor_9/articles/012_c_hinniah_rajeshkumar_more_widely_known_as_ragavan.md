C
hinniah Rajeshkumar, more widely 
known as Ragavan, remains a pivotal 
figure in the history of the LTTE and the 
broader Tamil liberation movement. As a co-
founder of the LTTE and a trusted confidant 
of its notorious leader, Prabhakaran, Ragavan 
was instrumental in shaping the movement's 
formative years. However, by April 1984, 
disillusioned by the rising extremism, 
indiscriminate violence, and the cult-like 
reverence surrounding Prabhakaran, Ragavan 
made a pivotal decision: to sever all ties with 
the LTTE and seek exile in London.
Now a legal advisor and activist, Ragavan 
continues to be a formidable voice in the 
discourse on Tamil nationalism. In this rare, 
multi-part exclusive interview series with 
Jaffna Monitor, Ragavan offers unfiltered 
insights—revelations that only someone with 
his deep-rooted, insider perspective could 
share—delivering a sharp analysis of the 
LTTE's turbulent evolution, his departure 
from the movement, and his reflections on the 
political landscape today. Most importantly, he 
examines the lessons Sri Lankan Tamils have 
learned—or should learn—from the struggle. 
We present part two in this edition.
What do you think was the most 
profound ideological flaw in 
Prabhakaran's vision and the Tigers' 
strategy? In your view, which aspect 
of their beliefs or methods set them on 
an irreversible course, sealing their 
fate and making it impossible to turn 
back?
Before 1983, our political outlook was that 
we had initiated an armed struggle, and 
future generations would carry it forward. 
However, after the 1983 pogroms, the LTTE 
transformed into a formidable military 
force, and this perspective became narrower. 
Prabhakaran emerged as the central figure, 
and his ideology became the dominant 
doctrine. His principles—such as the need for 
a single, unified organization, the rejection 
of internal criticism, the prioritization of a 
strong military structure, and the reduction 
of the political framework to merely justifying 
military actions, with the belief that anything 
could be done and anyone could be killed to 
achieve Tamil Eelam—took precedence. The 
constructive idea that politics should oversee 
and control the military was sidelined.
For example, Amílcar Cabral, a Marxist 
thinker from Guinea-Bissau, fought against 
Portuguese colonialism. Although he 
established an armed resistance movement to 
confront the Portuguese army, he recognized 
the danger of the liberation military force 
overstepping its authority over the people. To 
counter this, he emphasized the importance 
of political control over the armed struggle. 
Cabral dismissed soldiers who misused their 
power, insisting that political ideology was 
paramount—not merely the conquest of 
territory through warfare.
Cabral believed it was essential to 
communicate the political cause to Portuguese 
democratic and progressive forces, as well as 
to the general public, earning him influence 
and support beyond his own people. For him, 
the liberation struggle was fundamentally 
about the well-being of the people, not merely 
defeating the enemy or capturing land.
Moreover, he believed in collective leadership 
and revolutionary democracy. Cabral stressed: 
"Do not be afraid of the people, and persuade 
them to take part in all the decisions that 
concern them—this is the basic condition 
of revolutionary democracy, which little by 
little we must achieve in accordance with the

development of our struggle and our life." His 
ideology was rooted in consent rather than 
coercion, and he forged unity among different 
liberation movements rather than pursuing 
a policy of annihilation. Furthermore, he 
emphasized that in guerrilla warfare, the 
guiding principle should be to minimize 
casualties among both civilians and fighters.
In contrast, Prabhakaran did not adopt a 
strategy of leveraging military victories to 
establish revolutionary democracy. The LTTE 
lacked a political vision to gain support from 
progressive and democratic forces in the 
south. Its leadership was authoritarian, rooted 
in pure militarism. Prabhakaran's sole focus 
was on achieving Tamil Eelam at any cost, 
regardless of the heavy losses of cadres and 
civilians.
In this pursuit, he viewed the total 
annihilation of both himself and the LTTE 
as an acceptable outcome. While it may be 
justifiable for someone to sacrifice themselves 
for a cause they believe in, Prabhakaran 
extended this logic further—regarding mass 
casualties among the Tamil people as an 
inevitable and permissible price for achieving 
his goal. Whether it resulted in the realization 
of Tamil Eelam or complete destruction, 
Prabhakaran was willing to embrace either 
outcome. This was the most profound 
ideological flaw in Prabhakaran's thinking and 
the Tigers' approach.
What's your take? When Prabhakaran 
met his end, do you think he died a 
defeated man or one content with the 
path he chose?
It's difficult to say for certain. The fame, 
power, recognition, and the stature of leading 
an organization with formidable military 
capabilities likely weighed heavily on him 
in his later years. From what I've heard, at 
some point, Prabhakaran realized they were 
heading toward total annihilation. However, 
he remained unwavering in his belief that 
they had to perish together—surrender was 
never an option. After building such a massive 
military structure, I believe that Prabhakaran 
felt trapped in a vicious cycle with no other 
path left for him.
He had little regard for the suffering of his 
own people, whom he claimed to be liberating 
from the Sinhala majoritarian state. For him, 
the equation was brutally simple: the Tamil 
people must either achieve Tamil Eelam or 
face annihilation. In his worldview, it was that 
straightforward—if you can live, live in Tamil 
Eelam; if not, then die.
Did Prabhakaran truly believe in his 
cause? How could he justify leading 
an entire ethnic group to destruction, 
including the forcible abduction of 
children as young as 11 during the 
final stages of the war and sending 
them to certain death?
Prabhakaran was unwavering in his belief that 
the struggle for Tamil Eelam was an all-or-
nothing endeavor—either the realization of 
Tamil Eelam or total annihilation. He showed 
no hesitation in accepting mass casualties. 
The LTTE was fully aware that the Sri Lankan 
army was brutal and engaged in an all-out war, 
with little regard for civilian lives.
Even as the LTTE's territory dwindled to just 
a few kilometers, they persisted in forcibly 
recruiting children and sending them to the 
frontlines, fully aware that it meant certain 
death. From our perspective, such actions

seemed reckless and unnecessary, but to 
Prabhakaran and his comrades, they were 
considered essential.
To an outsider, these actions may seem 
irrational, even senseless. However, such 
sacrifices were necessary for someone like 
Prabhakaran, who believed that only the 
body dies while the soul endures. He lived 
by the uncompromising mantra of "Victory 
or Death," and under that belief system, the 
loss of lives, no matter how great, was not 
considered an issue. His mission, in many 
respects, was suicidal, yet he pursued it with 
unwavering conviction.
It would not be entirely fair to say that 
Prabhakaran felt no guilt for the destruction 
he caused. In a rare moment of reflection, 
he once admitted to me that if Tamil Eelam 
were achieved at the cost of so many lives, 
he might consider taking his own life. He 
also mentioned that he intended to step 
down from leadership once Tamil Eelam was 
achieved, as he had no desire to govern the 
country. However, this was expressed in the 
early 1980s. Over time, as he was elevated to 
near-deity status with the "Sun God" label 
systematically bestowed upon him, one could 
question whether his outlook remained the 
same in his later years.
Was it not an issue for Prabhakaran to 
sacrifice his own family?
No, it wasn't. According to the LTTE's 
ideology, a member was not to form 
attachments to their family or anything else 
beyond their unwavering loyalty to the leader 
and the vision of Tamil Eelam. While this 
ideology was deeply problematic—essentially 
dehumanizing the fighters—it was considered 
strategically necessary. Instead of fighting 
for the people or the land they cherished,

members were taught to sever all personal 
bonds to remain fully committed to the cause.
In the early days, when someone sought to 
join the Tigers, Prabhakaran would ask, "If 
your father or brother opposes our cause, 
would you kill them?" Only those who 
answered "yes" were accepted. This absolute 
loyalty was seen as vital for the movement's 
survival.
I recall a chilling incident during the LTTE's 
annihilation of TELO, where a Tiger fighter 
shot his own elder brother, a member of 
TELO. In another case, an LTTE fighter 
exploited a personal friendship by luring a 
close friend from a rival group under the 
pretext of a conversation, only to murder 
him upon arrival. These incidents exemplify 
the extent to which loyalty to the cause was 
prioritized over personal relationships.
Wasn't betrayal—such as luring 
a friend to his death—or moral 
collapse—like killing one's own 
sibling in the name of Tamil Eelam—a 
problem for Prabhakaran and the 
LTTE?
For Prabhakaran, achieving Tamil Eelam was 
the only morality. There were no competing 
moral frameworks; every action was justified 
if it served the ultimate goal of Tamil Eelam. 
In this project, any obstacle—whether a 
person or principle—could be eliminated 
without hesitation or mercy. Anyone could 
be killed, regardless of their relationship, if it 
meant advancing the cause. The concepts of 
betrayal or moral collapse held no significance 
within the LTTE's framework because the only 
measure of right and wrong was loyalty to the 
struggle for Tamil Eelam.
In the eyes of Prabhakaran and the Tigers, 
they never betrayed anyone—only others 
betrayed them. Actions that might seem 
like treachery to outsiders were rationalized 
within the LTTE's ideological framework. 
For instance, when a Tiger fighter had to kill 
a family member or close friend, the LTTE 
taught him that the victim was a traitor to the 
Tamil Eelam cause. Thus, the act of fratricide 
was not only accepted but seen as necessary. 
This narrative enabled the LTTE to rationalize 
even the most brutal actions as morally 
justified.
How did Prabhakaran view other 
militaries, including the Sri Lankan 
Army?
Prabhakaran's worldview was deeply 
militaristic. He held the military in high 
regard, regardless of which army it was, 
valuing it as a disciplined institution that 
carried out orders without deviation. For him, 
the essence of a soldier's role transcended 
national or political boundaries. Even when 
it came to the Sri Lankan army, against which 
the LTTE fought relentlessly, he harbored  
respect. He believed that soldiers were 
fundamentally different from politicians—
dedicated individuals who simply performed 
their duty. In his mind, this distinction set 
soldiers apart as honorable, irrespective of the 
side they fought on.
A telling example of this occurred in 1987, 
during the Indo-Lanka Accord period. 
At a time when the LTTE was fiercely 
propagandizing against the Sri Lankan 
military, Prabhakaran extended an invitation 
to a high-ranking Sri Lankan military 
officer for a meal. This gesture exemplified 
his reverence for the military as a sacred 
institution. To Prabhakaran, even those 
soldiers fighting against his cause were not

personal enemies—they were simply doing 
their duty, as all professional soldiers do.
What led Prabhakaran to order the 
mass abduction of children during the 
final stages of the war?
Whether Prabhakaran was fully aware of the 
brutal forced recruitment of children in the 
final stages remains uncertain. However, as the 
leader of the LTTE, he cannot escape blame. 
Organizations collapsing under extreme 
pressure—like a house of cards—often resort 
to desperate, unthinkable actions. In this 
context, the LTTE's recruitment of children 
reflects a breakdown in both strategy and 
ethics.
The very idea of recruiting children into 
armed conflict was fundamentally flawed—
not only morally but also logically. Yet, in the 
face of mounting desperation, logic seemed to 
take a backseat. Prabhakaran's mindset might 
have been along the lines of, "I joined the 
liberation movement when I was 16, so why 
shouldn't you?" But this reasoning was deeply 
problematic. There was no coherent strategy 
behind the recruitment—it was a desperate 
attempt to sustain a crumbling organization, 
no matter the human cost.
What were Prabhakaran's views on 
God?
Prabhakaran did have a belief in God, which 
was shaped by his ideological worldview. 
He was a devotee of Murugan, but this was 
a personal choice. It is fair to say that the 
LTTE was a secular organization. However, 
the Tamil language discourse has been 
influenced by Hindu rituals and practices, so

it's reasonable to suggest there were traces of a 
religious outlook.
Moreover, Prabhakaran's ideology drew 
influence from the Bhagavad Gita—not as 
an overt religious text but as a source of 
ideological strength. At the core of his belief 
system was the notion that extraordinary 
achievements could only be accomplished 
through uncompromising authoritarian 
leadership, akin to figures like Adolf Hitler.
Prabhakaran admired Hitler, viewing him as a 
leader who had successfully rebuilt Germany 
from ruins. The atrocities committed by 
Hitler—the massacre of millions of Jews—
did not trouble him. To Prabhakaran, these 
acts were not moral failures but necessary 
sacrifices for a greater cause. He would 
rationalize them by asking, "What's wrong 
with what Hitler did to establish a pure 
German nation?"
This same logic shaped his vision for Tamil 
Eelam: the belief that anything could be 
justified to achieve the goal, including killing 
anyone who stood in the way. Wars and 
massacres were deemed acceptable as long 
as they served the mission. Numbers were 
irrelevant to him. In Prabhakaran's view, if the 
 LTTE supremo Prabhakaran

soul is immortal and only the body perishes, 
the loss of life—no matter how large—was 
insignificant.
This ideological mindset was evident in some 
of Prabhakaran's most extreme actions. It 
was this way of thinking that drove him to 
expel the entire Muslim population from 
the Northern Province in a single day. 
His admiration for the story of the Jews 
establishing Israel coexisted with a disturbing 
respect for the man responsible for the 
Holocaust.
It would be simplistic to say that 
Prabhakaran was merely following Hitler. 
Instead, his ideology was a blend of Hitler's 
authoritarianism, Zionist exclusivist nation-
state building, and the teachings of the 
Bhagavad Gita.
What were Prabhakaran's positive 
qualities?
I once remarked that if Prabhakaran had 
been born in the United States, he might have 
become someone like Bill Gates. Prabhakaran 
was an exceptional organizer, not just because 
of innate talent but also due to the skills he 
honed over the years. His attention to detail 
was extraordinary, and he was known to be 
a perfectionist. Even something as trivial as 
a leaflet couldn't contain a single spelling 
error without drawing his ire. As early as 
the late 1970s, he had already understood 
how to build an underground movement by 
analyzing the weaknesses and the collapse 
of organizations like the Tamil Student 
Federation. He was also an avid reader.
Prabhakaran was a tireless worker. Outside 
the realm of politics, he was a simple man—
approachable and capable of being playful. 
He could engage in casual conversations, 
showing warmth and humor to those who did 
not challenge his political ideology. However, 
if someone dared to question or oppose his 
beliefs, Prabhakaran would become an entirely 
different person.
He enjoyed good food and had a refined 
appreciation for well-prepared meals. That was 
one of the reasons he liked me—because I was 
a good cook. Although Prabhakaran could 
cook to some extent, whenever I was around, 
he would chop the necessary items for cooking 
and hand over the responsibility to me, saying, 
"Machan, please, you cook."
One of Prabhakaran's defining qualities 
was the care he showed toward his cadres, 
particularly injured fighters. He paid 
meticulous attention to their well-being, 
personally ensuring they received the 
treatment they needed. If wounded fighters 
were neglected or if regular fighters were not

provided with adequate food, Prabhakaran 
would not hesitate to express his anger. This 
deep concern fostered intense loyalty among 
his early followers.
However, this loyalty was conditional—if 
any of those same fighters went against his 
ideology, Prabhakaran would show no mercy. 
He would not hesitate to eliminate even those 
he had once cared for.
How did Prabhakaran differ from other 
leaders of the liberation struggle?
Among the prominent leaders of the armed 
liberation movements, I believe EPRLF's 
Padmanabha had a more well-rounded 
political vision rooted in revolutionary 
democratic principles. Padmanabha embodied 
a democratic mindset that Prabhakaran lacked. 
While Prabhakaran built unity based on 
ethnic and cultural nationalism, Padmanabha 
advocated for solidarity along class lines as 
well. The EPRLF viewed the Tamil national 
liberation struggle as the first step toward 
a socialist revolution in Sri Lanka and also 
established connections with southern 
progressive forces.
Prabhakaran and the LTTE, by contrast, 
called for unity based purely on ethnic 
lines, sidelining class, caste, and gender 
issues. In essence, as Benedict Anderson 
observes, nationalism is a powerful political 
force but often lacks intellectual rigor and 
philosophical depth. While nationalist 
movements against colonialism typically 
carried progressive and inclusive elements, I 
consider ethnic nationalism to be reactionary 
and exclusionary. There is, in my view, a thin 
line between ethnic nationalism and fascism. 
Prabhakaran was an ethnic nationalist who 
believed in the formation of a pure Tamil 
nation.
What were the key factors behind 
Prabhakaran's success?
Discipline, ruthlessness, and unwavering 
commitment were the pillars of Prabhakaran's 
success. He led with absolute focus, 
eliminating any obstacle—or individual—that 
stood in the way of his mission.
How did so many youths and your 
generation place their trust in 
Prabhakaran's singular leadership?
It can certainly be attributed to Prabhakaran—
he was a man of action, not words. He 
achieved results through decisive military 
actions. However, I don't believe the credit 
lies with him alone. Sri Lanka's ethnocratic 
majoritarian governance played a crucial role. 
The state's failure to pursue inclusive politics 
that addressed minority concerns, along with 
brutal military attacks on Tamil civilians, 
fostered a powerful need for resistance, which 
the LTTE skillfully capitalized on.
Additionally, India, as a regional power, played 
a significant role by training militant groups, 
paving the way for the unprecedented growth 
of militant movements.
After 1986, when the LTTE had neutralized 
other Tamil militant groups, the Tamil people 
were left with only one option for resistance 
against the state: the LTTE. Those who wanted 
to continue the fight against state oppression 
had no choice but to align with the Tigers. 
For the youth of that era, scarred by state-
sponsored violence, there were no alternatives 
but to join the LTTE. The momentum 
Prabhakaran sustained throughout the struggle 
also played a key role.

What Was Prabhakaran's View on 
Women? 
In later years, women constituted nearly 50% of the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). However, 
this seemingly progressive move masked a more 
troubling reality—both Prabhakaran and the LTTE, 
in their early years, harbored deeply problematic 
and misogynistic views toward women.
Initially, women were not allowed to join the 
movement. The rationale? If male fighters engaged 
in romantic relationships, their dedication to the 
cause would weaken. But this mindset unfairly 
cast women as distractions rather than equal 
participants, reinforcing a culture of exclusion.
In its early years, the LTTE also banned marriage, 
forcing fighters to suppress their emotions. Many 
lived with the silent burden of unfulfilled desires 
and stifled relationships. A tragic 
example is the story of Charles Anthony, 
also known as Seelan, one of the LTTE's 
most celebrated figures. Prabhakaran 
admired him so deeply that he named 
his eldest son after him and even 
established a military division in his 
honor. The LTTE's attack on a military 
vehicle in Thirunelveli in 1983—an 
attack later used as a pretext for the 
state-sponsored July 1983 pogroms—
was carried out as an act of vengeance 
for Seelan's death.
However, Seelan's personal life tells a 
different story. After being injured in 
an attack in Chavakachcheri, Jaffna, 
he was sent to Tamil Nadu for medical 
treatment. Before this, in Sri Lanka, 
he had received psychotherapy from a 
young Tamil woman supporter, with 
whom he fell in love. She later traveled 
to India to assist in his recovery. A 
dedicated early supporter of the LTTE 
from Valvettithurai, she had come to 
help the movement. But when news

of their relationship reached Prabhakaran, 
he intervened harshly. With little regard for 
Seelan's recovery, Prabhakaran ordered him 
back to Jaffna.
Seelan returned a heartbroken man. I believe it 
was this emotional devastation that ultimately 
led him to end his life. Today, Seelan is 
celebrated as a hero, but those who write 
glowing tributes to his bravery will never fully 
comprehend the depth of the personal pain he 
carried.
At that time, the LTTE had a troubling 
tendency to place the blame squarely on 
women in such situations. Even though Seelan 
and the physiotherapist were equally involved 
in the relationship, Prabhakaran did not hold 
him accountable. Instead, the woman bore the 
brunt of the punishment. Despite risking her 
life to support the LTTE, she was permanently 
expelled from the movement. Meanwhile, 
Seelan was allowed to remain, though he 
carried the weight of his loss.
Years later, in 2009, after the war had ended, 
I met this woman again. Time had not healed 
her wounds, and she had never forgiven 
Prabhakaran. "He was the one who destroyed 
my true love," she told me, her voice still heavy 
with sadness.
How Did Prabhakaran, Who Once Tore 
Couples Apart, Marry for Love Himself 
in a few years?
The contradiction vividly reflects 
Prabhakaran's personality. Bala, or 'Short Bala,' 
a fellow LTTE member, shared a fate similar 
to Seelan. When Short Bala fell in love with 
a woman in Sri Lanka, Prabhakaran swiftly 
sent him to India. However, after the LTTE 
fractured in 1980, Bala joined PLOTE and 
eventually married the woman he had fallen 
for. They later settled in Canada, where he 
passed away a couple of years ago.
A few days after Prabhakaran's marriage to 
Mathivathani, I confronted him about these 
contradictions. I asked him directly, "I'm 
not saying your marriage was a mistake, but 
what you did to Seelan and Short Bala was 
wrong. Do you agree?" Prabhakaran refused 
to acknowledge it. "I've introduced a rule that 
anyone who has been with the LTTE for five 
years can marry. That's it," he replied flatly.
"Alright," I said, "you've been in the movement 
for five years, but Mathivathani wasn't part of 
the movement, was she?" That struck a nerve. 
His irritation was palpable—his expression 
tightened, and without saying another word, 
he stood up and walked away.

Prabhakaran believed he had the authority to 
change the rules, as he was both the rule-maker 
and the crowned head of the LTTE. After I left the 
organization, I heard of another incident involving 
an LTTE cadre who fell in love with a female cadre 
without the LTTE's knowledge. When they tried to 
escape together, they were caught. The woman was 
pregnant, and the decision was made to execute 
them both.
How did he justify these contradictions?
The answer was simple: if Prabhakaran did it, it was 
right. He could change, bend, or scrap the rules 
Prabhakaran and Mathivathani at the Thiruporur Kandaswamy Temple 
on their wedding day
as needed, and no one dared to 
question him.
Was Prabhakaran Inherently 
a Flawed Person?
Prabhakaran was a man who 
genuinely believed that every 
decision he made was both right 
and justified, with all his actions 
rooted in what he saw as the pursuit 
of a greater cause. This unshakable 
conviction gave him the authority, 
in his mind, to amend, modify, 
or discard rules as he pleased, 
consistency and consultation be 
damned. To him, his actions were 
beyond external scrutiny. In his 
world, it was as simple as that.
In the early years of the LTTE, 
two internal assassinations shook 
the movement—Patgunam and 
Michael were executed, both by 
Prabhakaran's own hand. Their 
crime? They dared to act against the 
direction in which he was steering 
the movement.
If I had crossed him at any point 
during my time with the LTTE, 
there's no doubt in my mind—he 
would have killed me, too. And 
the irony? Because I was close to 
him, he would have either killed 
me himself or ordered it—and then 
cried over his actions. That was 
Prabhakaran.

was the first time he saw a television with 
such a large screen. It was flat, modern, and 
had impeccable sound quality. Perhaps the 
neighbor’s son had sent it from Saudi Arabia. 
He turned his face to look at the street. It was 
engulfed in darkness.
When he was a little boy, he constantly 
nagged his mother to buy a television set. 
Their sole income was his late father’s 
measly pension. It is that money that allowed 
his mother to keep him and his sister from 
starving and in school. At that time, the 
neighbors had a black-and-white television. 
He and his sister visited their house in the 
late evenings to watch television. For some 
reason, his sister was not interested in 
television. But he was afraid to come here 
alone in the dark. Therefore, he begged his 
sister to accompany him. He would sit on the 
ground with his eyes glued to the television. 
After some time, his sister would start to 
murmur, “Can we go home now?” He would 
not even hear her words. In desperation, she 
would secretly pinch his thigh. He would 
then plead, “A little longer.” The people 
at this house would serve them tea and 
boiled palmyra tubers. His sister would be 
embarrassed. He would accept them for fear 
that they might not let him watch television if 
he declined.
At home, he would play television by gluing a 
piece of white paper onto an empty matchbox, 
cutting out the middle part of the piece of 
paper, and painting the sides. There would 
always be some matchbox television sets in 
his school bag. When he was a little older, 
he started going to the village main street to 
watch television. The color television set at 
Meena Cafe on main street was always on. 
He would watch television as though he was 
bewitched. His eyes would shine. No program 
bored him. Often the broadcast signal was 
poor, and the television would just show a 
thousand white dots instead of a moving 
picture. He would imagine that they were a 
thousand people running. Sometimes there 
would be only video without audio. But he

would create a matching soundtrack in his 
imagination. If there was only audio, he could 
imagine matching pictures. When there was 
a power cut, he could stare at the screen for 
minutes on end without batting an eyelid. 
All he needed was the television set. He 
could imagine the rest, sounds and pictures. 
He would return home only when the shop 
closed.
His visits next door to watch television 
had become less frequent. His village was 
located by the side of a highway connecting 
two cities. The main street  lay next to the 
highway. On those days when the army 
patrolled the highway, the main street would 
be deserted. As soon as people heard army 
vehicles at a distance, shops would be 
shuttered immediately, and people would 
hurriedly scatter. Whenever the army passed 
the main street, they invariably expended 
some bullets. Those were just warning shots. 
The army never left the highway to enter the 
village.
On those days when the main street shops lay 
shuttered, he would go to the neighbor’s to 
watch television. By then they had bought a 
small color television set. Since he had grown 
up, they would insist that he sit on a chair. 
They would serve him snacks and tea. He 
was too shy to accept. The lady of the house 
was indeed a close friend of his mother. They 
were close enough to each other that on minor 
emergencies, they exchanged sugar or tea 
or some such. He, however, was reluctant to 
be obliged to anyone. But on the matter of 
watching television, his reluctance did not 
stand in his way.
When he passed the age of playing with 
matchbox televisions, a small color television 
set did indeed make its way to his house. His 
sister became a teacher, and gave her first 
salary to his mother, who then combined it with 
her savings to buy him a color television. He 
asked his sister to sew a beautiful cloth cover 
to protect the television set. His school bag no 
longer carried matchbook televisions. Instead, 
he always carried a TV guide in his bag.

As soon as he returned from school, he would 
sit in front of the television and would not 
budge. He would sit there like a statue. His 
mother called him to eat, repeatedly. After 
the tenth call, he would rush into the kitchen, 
grab a plateful of food, and rush back to sit 
in front of the television. But his schoolwork 
did not seem to be affected by this obsession 
with television. He always came near the top 
of his class. Once he told his sister, pointing 
to the television, “This is more useful than our 
teachers.”
He missed out on university admission by 
just a few grade points. He was somewhat 
disheartened. He studied all day. As soon 
as it became dark, he would turn off the 
lights in the room and watch television until 
midnight. His mother would say, “Don’t 
watch television in the dark, son, you would 
ruin your eyes.” He never even heard her 
warnings.
When he was twenty, the army entered the 
village for the first time. When village folks 
heard that the army was on its way, they 
grabbed whatever they could and fled to save 
their lives. His sister was then teaching at a 
city school and lived in a rented room in the 
city. So, he and his mother decided to flee 
to the city. All their belongings fit in two 
suitcases. He secured the television set on his 
bicycle’s carrier. He put his mother and the 
luggage on a vehicle that was going towards 
the city along the highway and followed it on 
his bicycle.
When he reached the city, he sold the 
television set. He got very little money for it. 
He went to the shop of a relative and left his 
bicycle there saying that he would be back 
shortly. He then walked to the bus stand and 
boarded a bus. During the four-hour journey, 
the bus crossed twenty checkpoints. He got 
off by the side of the highway and walked 
towards the forest through paddy fields. 
He asked for directions from the people he 
encountered along the way. Although it was 
dark, moonlight lit up the forest. He walked 
all night along a forest path and reached a

village. There was a training camp run by the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
Perhaps because he joined the militant group 
after walking through the forest, his nom de 
guerre became kāṉakaṉ, meaning “forrester.” 
But his comrades called him ‘Jungle.’ It 
became a legend in the group that if Jungle 
was at the forefront of an attack, then that 
attack was sure to succeed. It was as if he 
was born to wage war. His left eye was called 
‘strategy,’ and the right eye ‘bravery.’ His 
left leg was called ‘steady,’ while the right 
‘speed.’ Countless were the sieges that he 
broke from the front. Eventually he lost the leg 
called ‘speed’ in an aerial bombardment, only 
‘steady’ remained.
He walked around the camp using a crutch. 
He was careful not to let his mother or sister 
learn that he had lost a leg. Even when there 
was a ceasefire, he did not go to visit his 
mother. He made sure that she did not know 
where he was. Only a year later, they saw him 
on Tiger television. The very next week, his 
mother and sister came to visit him. It was an 
amicable meeting; not like he had imagined. 
His mother stroked the stump that remained in 
place of his right leg. They chatted with him 
enthusiastically and left.
He was the presenter for three programs 
on Tiger television. Among them, the half-
hour show called ‘Liberation Songs’ was 
immensely popular. He collated popular songs 
by singers like Sānthan, Thēṉisai Sellappā, 
Sukumār, and Chiṭṭu. The lines of poetry 
he recited before presenting each song, and 
his booming voice, rich in modulation and 
tone, and laden with emotion dazzled many 
listeners. Once Sānthan told him, “You have 
many more fans than me,” and laughed.
When people saw him outside, they mobbed 
him. Because he was seated whenever he 
appeared on television, most people did not 
know that he had lost a leg. When they saw 
that majestic voice hobble along on a crutch, 
their faces fell. Some mothers would hug 
and kiss him. Perhaps they remembered their 
children whom they had lost.

He received a lot of fan mail. Some of them 
were love letters. He would read them alone 
with a smile and tear them up. “Our girls now 
dare to write love letters to the militant group 
itself,” his lips would murmur.
During the ceasefire, a music troupe from 
Vaṉṉi toured Europe to hold performances 
for the Tamil diaspora there. He accompanied 
them as their producer. Many event organizers 
had insisted that he come with them. When 
they were served alcohol on the plane, the 
singer next to him asked half-jokingly, “I 
haven’t tasted alcohol for such a long time, 
shall I try?” His frown in response made the 
singer say with resignation, “There is nothing 
wrong in having some alcohol, but it is not 
good for the voice,” and leaned back into his 
seat.
The gluttony in European cities caused him 
stomach aches. People kidnapped him almost 
violently to take him home to feed him. 
Whenever he appeared on stage, the youth in 
the audience cheered uproariously. When he 
returned from Europe, his suitcase was full 
of expensive gifts. A customs officer at the 
Colombo airport held up one of those gifts 
and asked, “Would you let me have this?” 
With a smile, he motioned with his hands to 
indicate his agreement.
As soon as he returned to the camp, he 
distributed the gifts among his comrades. 
What remained for him were three greeting 
cards expressing love. Two of them were 
received in Paris while the third was in 
Switzerland. The Paris cards were written in 
English. The Swiss card had a third-rate love 
poem in baby-talk Tamil. He did not care for 
what was written on the cards. But he could 
not bring himself to tear them up because they 
were beautiful. Once back at the camp, he did 
indeed tear them up. He told endless stories 
about Europe to his comrades into the wee 
hours of the morning. He believed firmly that 
as long as the Tamil struggle had the support 
of the diaspora, no one could defeat it.
When his unit took the decision to surrender 
at the Naṉthikkadal lagoon, he wanted to 
swallow his cyanide pill and die on the spot. 
But his commanding officer said nothing 
would change if he killed himself. Once 
the guns, uniforms, dog tags, and cyanide 
capsules were buried in the ground, his unit 
scattered and dissolved into the sea of people. 
He did not want to bury his cyanide capsule. 
He tucked it into his waist and walked along 
Naṉthikkadal. There were about twenty men, 
women, and children waiting in a boat to 
cross the lagoon into the area under control 
of the army. The plan was to leave when the 
shelling by the army subsided. He left his 
artificial leg behind and boarded the boat 
with just his crutch. The boat started when 
the shelling stopped. He threw his cyanide 
capsule into the sea.
Only when the boat reached the shore did 
they notice that there was a row of soldiers 
lying on the ground with guns at the ready 
awaiting the boat. When they disembarked, 
they heard the command, “Undress yourself 
and come forward.” “Sir, we are just ordinary 
people.” they shouted back. The command 
for undressing was repeated. When they 
hesitated, there was a barrage of gunfire 
from the shore. The sea water throbbed 
under the gunfire. Men, women, and children 
were stripped naked, and their bodies were 
searched for hidden explosives. Everyone 
was then marched, still stark naked, for about 
a kilometer. They were allowed to put their 
clothes back on only then, just after they were 
herded onto a bus. He kept his head bowed. 
He did not want to look anyone in the eye.

The bus traveled for hours. When babies cried 
of thirst, hunger, or heat, their mothers slapped 
them into silence. When the bus stopped at 
the Vavuniya detention camp, he climbed 
down from the bus with his eyes firmly on the 
ground. While he was waiting in the queue of 
people, someone tapped him on the shoulder 
and called out ‘kāṉakaṉ’ in a hushed voice. He 
jerked his head upward to see an army officer 
grinning at him. The officer took the crutch 
in one hand and helped him stand up with the 
other. When he stood up, the officer handed 
him the crutch, supported him by his shoulder, 
and took him away.
His interrogation began in that small room 
fenced with corrugated iron. When he was 
asked for his real name, he said ‘Ravikumar.’ 
He also told them that his nom de guerre 
was ‘kāṉakaṉ’.’ The officer laughed, saying 
“it seems you are also called ‘Jungle’!” 
He realized that there was no use in hiding 
anything from them. Yet, he felt that it was 
his duty not to divulge information as best 
as he could. As the interrogation proceeded, 
he was left with nothing to hide anyway. The 
interrogation was being recorded on a big 
ledger. The soldiers around him were video 
recording him on their cellphones. Whenever 
he bowed his head, they showered him with 
Sinhala obscenities and made him look up 
again. “‘Kāṉakaṉ’ is uncomfortable. Stop 
the filming,” commanded the officer with a 
smile and the recordings ceased. Everything 
thereafter proceeded as he had expected.
They kept beating him as if he were a rabbit 
lying on the ground, unable to move. They 
surrounded him and beat him with sticks 
and rifle butts. He did not really know the 
answers to their questions. They sat him up, 
held him steady, and cleanly and steadily 
sliced off a piece of flesh from his thigh above 
his amputated leg, as if they were cutting a 
piece of cake. They handed him the piece and 
asked him to eat it. He pretended to faint and 
collapsed to the ground with his eyes glazed. 
They stuffed the piece of flesh, blood dripping,

into his mouth. It glided down his throat.
He kept vomiting blood for three days. Even 
after he was sent to a rehabilitation camp, 
he vomited often. At mealtimes, if he saw 
meat or fish, he retched and vomited. He 
stopped eating meat. There were about two 
hundred surrendered adult militants in that 
rehabilitation camp. The six that died of 
sickness, and the two that died by suicide 
were replaced by newcomers. The army took 
care to ensure that the number of inmates did 
not dip below two hundred.
He was always depressed. Two people in the 
camp suffered from depression, and he was 
one of them. The other kept stripping himself 
and received a beating from the army every 
day for this. The army officer said it was a 
ruse to escape from the camp.
A psychiatrist showed up to train fifty 
inmates chosen from the two hundred. As 
he was lecturing about how to escape from 
depression and to be happy, he interrupted, 
saying, “If we are freed from here and can go 
home, we will become happy.” Whatever the 
doctor said, he dismissed it with a flippant 
response. It seemed like eventually the doctor 
himself was depressed. The doctor hurriedly 
concluded the training session for former 
militants and moved on to a training session 
with active soldiers.
After exactly a year-and-a-half, he was 
among the first batch of detainees released 
from the camp. That batch consisted of those 
who had lost a limb. The army gave each of 
them a new vēṭṭi and a shirt. They organized 
a publicity event at the camp to hand over 
former detainees to their families in front of 
the media. His mother had come to receive 
him. Her face was infected with a happy grin.
His sister had married and was living in the 
city. His mother also lived with her until now. 
He thought his mother was taking him to his 
sister’s house. But she took him to their home 
in the village.
The house was in shambles. Even doors 
and doorposts had been burgled away. His 
mother made cloth curtains for the holes 
that remained where there were doors and 
windows earlier. She bought a table, a chair, 
and a bed for his room. He remained secluded 
in his room all the time. He remembered 
telling the psychiatrist that he would be happy 
if was allowed to go home.
The main street had changed a lot. Meena 
Cafe where he used to watch television had 
now become ‘Lanka Café,’ run by the army. 
There, too, was a television set that was on 
all the time. He walked past it with his head 
bowed. He felt as if everyone on the main 
street was walking with their heads bowed. If 
his eyes accidentally met another pair of eyes, 
all he saw was fear.
His mother was saving to get him an artificial 
leg. ‘Where would I go with an artificial leg?’ 
He thought, ‘It would be better to use that 
money to buy a television, so that I can watch 
it in my room.’ But since saying that would 
hurt his mother’s feelings, he just stayed in 
his room in silence. Once a week, he was 
required to go to the army camp to check in. 
He went out only on those days.
That evening, he heard music from the 
neighbor’s house. ‘Happiness is what 
you create yourself,” he remembered the 
psychiatrist saying. He lay down with his 
eyes closed. When it was dusk, he took his 
crutch and went outside. When he struggled 
to climb the front steps, Mahinda Rajapakse 
was speaking on television. Within a few 
moments, he heard the television being turned 
off.

The neighbor came to the front door. He 
told the neighbor that he had come to watch 
television. The neighbor, with downcast 
eyes, said that they were about to have dinner 
and stood blocking the doorway. As he took 
his crutch and struggled to climb down the 
steps, he clearly heard the neighbor mumble, 
‘‘Kāṉakaṉ’, if you come here, we will get into 
trouble with the army.’
He stood on the street and took a beedi from 
his pocket and tried to light it. His hand was 
trembling. It took four matches before he 
managed to light the beedi. He fell into this 
habit at the detention camp. His mother would 
buy him a bunch of beedis every morning.
He walked with the beedi in his mouth. He 
was surprised that the neighbor had forgotten 
his name, ‘Ravi.’ and addressed him as 
‘’kāṉakaṉ’. He took drags of the beedi as he 
walked. Suddenly it struck him how his sister 
or her husband had not come to visit him even 
though so much time had passed since he was 
released.
At midnight, his mother took a small lamp in 
her hand and walked softly towards his room. 
She would check on him like this every day. 
When she saw him sleeping, it gave her great 
relief.
When she stood at the door of his room and 
pointed the lamp towards his bed, it was 
empty. Alarmed, his mother turned the light to 
a corner of the room. There he sat, motionless, 
like a statue. His eyes were transfixed on the 
table in front of him. When she turned the 
light towards the table, she saw that there was 
a matchbox standing on it. She exploded into 
an uncontrollable wail. He sat motionless. His 
eyes were glowing.
