Janaki: 
Builder of a 
Network of 
ex-Fighters
Janaki served as the 
administrative head of 
the regiment, holding a 
rank just below that of 
the special commander, 
Brigadier Thurga. Both 
Brigadier Thurga and her 
deputy, Colonel Mohana, 
were killed during the Battle 
of Anandapuram in April 
2009. This devastating battle 
marked the near-collapse 
of the Sothiya Regiment, 
leaving the remaining female 
fighters scattered into small, 
disorganized groups.
A
t the center of these covert operations—
manipulating former combatants and 
pushing the LTTE diaspora's agenda to incite 
instability in Sri Lanka, thereby endangering the 
hard-earned peace and stability of thousands 
of ex-fighters—stands Janaki, a pivotal figure in 
the LTTE's Sothiya Regiment.

After Thurga's death, Mathuram was 
appointed as the new special commander, but 
she too perished in the final days of the war. 
Throughout this chaos, Janaki remained at her 
post as the administrative head, maintaining 
her authority and influence within the 
regiment, even as it crumbled around her.
Janaki, whose real name is Chithranjani 
(rpj;uQ;rdp), was born in Achchuveli. Her 
involvement with the LTTE began during 
the Indian Army's presence in Sri Lanka. 
Before officially joining the LTTE, she worked 
with the "Suthanthira Paravaigal" ("Birds of 
Freedom"), a group primarily comprised 
of students and women under the LTTE's 
political wing. This organization, composed 
of LTTE supporters and sympathizers, was 
not part of the formal military structure but 
played a vital role in assisting the movement. 
It was during this time that Janaki decided to 
become a full-time member of the LTTE in 
1988, at the height of the conflict between the 
Indian Army and the LTTE.
Janaki's military journey began with the 
fourth women's batch at Manal Aru, where 
she trained under the watchful eye of Sothiya 
(Michael Vasanthi)—a disciplined and highly 
skilled commander whose unwavering 
dedication to the cause left an indelible mark 
on her trainees. Tragically, Sothiya's life was 
cut short by illness, passing away on January 
11, 1990. In recognition of her legacy, LTTE 
supremo Prabhakaran immortalized her by 
establishing the Sothiya Regiment on July 14, 
1996.

When the regiment was formed, Janaki 
officially enlisted, swiftly rising through 
the ranks as both a formidable fighter and 
an astute leader. Her battlefield prowess 
earned her respect among her peers, and her 
reputation grew with every mission. Credible 
sources affirm that Janaki played a crucial 
role in several key offensives, including the 
decisive battle at Elephant Pass, where she 
showcased her tactical acumen and unyielding 
determination, solidifying her status as a force 
to be reckoned with on the frontlines.
Janaki was widely recognized as a 
highly capable leader within the LTTE's 
administration. Credible sources state that 
she had a natural talent for managing people 
efficiently while fostering warm and friendly 
relationships with her colleagues. Her genuine 
kindness earned her the respect and trust of 
the female fighters, making her one of the most 
well-regarded figures within the organization.
A former female fighter who served under 
Janaki fondly described her as "mf;fh 
rpf;fy; ,y;yhj Ms;" ("a leader without 
complications"). Similarly, a male fighter 
remarked, "She had no conflicts with us or the 
female fighters—she was a calm and balanced 
person."
Thinesh Master: The Trusted Advisor 
Who Chose Loyalty Over Escape
In 1992, Janaki married Thinesh Master 
(Sockalingam Senthilyogan), also known as 
'Vedi' Thinesh, a senior LTTE member and 
one of Prabhakaran's most trusted military 
advisors. Thinesh, born on December 3, 1961, 
in Pannalai, Tellippalai, hailed from a well-
educated and highly respected family. His 
father, Sockalingam, had served as Mannar's 
Assistant Government Agent (AGA), earning 
the family a solid reputation within their 
community.
All of Thinesh's siblings went on to become 
distinguished professionals. His elder brother, 
the late Senthilkumar, was a doctor in London,

while another brother, Dr. Senthill S. Mohan, is the Founder 
and CEO of Medcentre Health in Canada. His sisters 
also achieved notable success: one sister, Senthilvathana 
Sriskandarajah, holds a doctorate and resides in London, 
while another, Senthilkumari Gunachandran, an 
accomplished professional, lives in Australia.
A credible source who studied with Thinesh Master told 
Jaffna Monitor that he was an intelligent student in his 
school days. However, like many youths of his generation, 
Thinesh's life was profoundly altered by the mindless July 
1983 pogrom orchestrated by the then UNP government. 
The violence pushed countless Tamil youths toward 
militancy, seeking self-respect and justice. Thinesh was 
no exception—he abandoned his studies and, driven by 
the need to resist oppression, 
became a committed member 
of the LTTE.
Thinesh was known for his 
English fluency and deep 
understanding of military 
strategy. Yet, like many within 
Prabhakaran's inner circle, 
he was expected to be a 
compliant "yes-man." In 1983, 
Thinesh underwent specialized 
explosives training under 
Indian officials in New Delhi, 
India. He later worked closely

Agent (AGA)

with Anton Master, the head of the LTTE's military office. 
When Anton Master parted ways with the LTTE in 1988 after 
a fallout with Prabhakaran, Thinesh stepped into his role, 
officially taking over the leadership of the military office in 
1990.
Thinesh was also among the few trusted operatives who 
accompanied Prabhakaran on his secret return to Sri Lanka 
from India in 1987. As the war neared its bloody end, Thinesh 
had several chances to escape. However, he chose to stay by 
Prabhakaran's side, ultimately embracing death alongside him. 
His body was never recovered, fueling speculation among 
remnants of the LTTE that he may have surrendered and 
vanished into the ranks of the "disappeared."

Yet, credible sources who worked closely with 
him offered a different account. According 
to them, Thinesh expressed a deep resolve to 
remain with Prabhakaran until the end. Given 
his expertise with explosives, these sources 
speculate that Thinesh may have detonated 
himself, leaving no trace behind—his final act 
of loyalty, reducing himself to unidentifiable 
fragments.
In March 2009, as the war entered its 
devastating final phase, the ICRC sent a ship to 
Puthumathalan to evacuate injured civilians. 
Although Janaki's children—a girl and a 
boy—were not injured, she used her and her 
husband Vedi Thinesh's influence to secure 
their escape. She managed to 
have them included on the list of 
wounded evacuees, alongside her 
brother Aingaran—now residing 
in Australia—who posed as their 
father.
As the LTTE crumbled in May 
2009, Janaki moved into army-
controlled territory. She openly 
identified herself as an LTTE 
leader and surrendered to the 
military. What followed was 
highly unusual—while most 
female LTTE leaders and fighters 
endured lengthy detention and 
harsh interrogations, Janaki's 
time in custody lasted less than 
six months. This stark contrast 
raised suspicions among former 
fighters and observers.
Sources suggest that Janaki paid substantial 
bribes to key officials, ensuring her swift 
transfer from military custody to an IDP 
(Internally displaced people) camp. Once 
inside the camp, Janaki quietly orchestrated 
her escape. With the aid of bribery and corrupt 
officials, she acquired a passport and fled Sri 
Lanka, eventually making her way to Chennai.
The Troubling Self-Centeredness of 
Janaki
After fleeing Sri Lanka and starting anew 
in India, Janaki began her life in Chennai. 
A few years later, she relocated to one of 
the prestigious Villas, situated near the 
Anjanasutha Sri Yoga Anjaneya Swami Mantra 
temple in Kirugambakkam, Porur—a temple 
founded by renowned Tamil actor Arjun. She 
made this villa her home, a residence best 
described as independent and refined—not 
exactly opulent by high-end standards, yet far 
more comfortable than the average household 
in Chennai.
Her children's education reflects the privileges 
she managed to secure. Janaki enrolled her son 
and daughter at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan 
(PSBB), an elite institution renowned for its 
rigorous academics and steep fees. Admission 
to PSBB is difficult, not only because of the 
high costs but also due to the influence needed 
to secure a spot. The school's alums list reads 
like a who's who of Indian success stories:

Oscar-winning composer; Naga Chaitanya, a 
leading Telugu actor; Ravichandran Ashwin, 
celebrated Indian cricketer; and Narayana 
Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, among others.
Janaki's eldest daughter, who has the name of a 
female character from ancient Tamil literature, 
was once a classmate of Balachandran 
Prabhakaran, the son of LTTE leader Velupillai 
Prabhakaran, in Kilinochchi. She has pursued 
a career in medicine and currently works as 
a duty doctor for a multinational company. 
Credible sources indicate that she is also 
working toward an MD in psychology, 
adding yet another dimension to her 
accomplishments.
Meanwhile, Janaki's son, whose name 
includes the word "Tamil," recently completed 
his B.Tech in Mechatronics, Robotics, and 
Automation Engineering in 2023 from the 
renowned Vellore Institute of Technology 
(VIT), Chennai campus. Enrolled in 2020 
under roll number 20BMH1084, Janaki's 
son quickly distinguished himself through 
his academic and technical excellence. (For 
privacy reasons, we have chosen not to publish 
the names of Janaki's son and daughter.)
On March 20, 2023, La Trobe University's 
Vice-Chancellor, Professor Theo Farrell, 
announced the winners of the Technology 
Infusion Grand Challenge in India. Among 
the standout participants was Team Tsars 
from VIT Chennai, who were crowned 
overall winners for developing an innovative 
product—a smart breathalyzer called 
SafenSober, designed to reduce alcohol-related 
two-wheeler accidents, addressing a major 
safety concern in India.
Janaki's son was a key member of Team Tsars, 
where he showcased exceptional technical 
brilliance and dedication. Their project earned 
top honors at the award ceremony held on 
March 20, 2024, in New Delhi. As part of their 
prize, the team received an all-expense-paid, 
two-week mentorship at La Trobe University's 
campus in Melbourne, Australia.

Interestingly, Janaki's son, still holding Sri 
Lankan citizenship, recently returned to Sri 
Lanka on a temporary passport to finalize his 
travel documents for the upcoming trip to 
Australia. During this visit, however, Jaffna 
Monitor uncovered that he met with key 
members of Janaki's network, delivering speeches 
infused with Tamil nationalist rhetoric. He 
urged them to "work hard" for the cause—even 
though he himself was preparing for a luxurious 
mentorship in Melbourne and eyeing a possible 
master's degree at a prestigious university abroad.
Those familiar with India's education system 
understand just how exorbitant private 
medical education and specialized degrees 
like Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation 
Engineering can be—often costing crores of 
Indian rupees. Janaki managed to finance these 
staggering expenses, reportedly with support 
from her late husband Vedi Thinesh's siblings 
and through her own business ventures in 
Chennai.
Janaki's Sources of Income
According to credible sources, Janaki's 
primary source of income is linked to her close 
Dr. Senthill S. Mohan

connection with her brother-in-law, Dr. 
Senthill S. Mohan, the founder and CEO of 
Medcentre Health in Canada. An alumnus of 
Madras Medical College and Chennai Medical 
College, Dr. Senthill S. Mohan also served as 
a resident physician at the Batticaloa Teaching 
Hospital.
He is a highly regarded consultant in the 
healthcare industry, having built an impressive 
career. After an early stint in cardiology (2000–
2001), he transitioned to emergency medicine, 
where he worked as an emergency physician in 
Canada for 14 years (2001–2015). In 2012, he 
founded Medcentre Health, a venture offering 
comprehensive healthcare services across the 
Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
Sources reveal that medical tourism has 
become a cornerstone of Dr. Senthill's business 
model. Over the years, he has facilitated 
treatment for hundreds of patients from more 
than 20 countries, arranging world-class 
healthcare in India—primarily in Chennai—
where costs are significantly lower than in 
Western countries.
Even before Janaki settled in Chennai, Dr. 
Senthill had been referring patients to India 
for major medical procedures, leveraging the 
region's affordability and high-quality care. His 
wife, Dr. Subhathini Senthill Mohan—an MD, 
CCFP, and FCFP-certified family doctor and 
general practitioner—manages these business 
ventures. She frequently travels to India and, 
when in Chennai, consults patients at Sri 
Ramachandra Medical Centre, Porur.
According to sources, Janaki now handles 
the logistics for these international patients, 
overseeing everything from accommodation to 
transportation. This arrangement has evolved 
into a highly profitable venture for her, as 
she meticulously orchestrates every aspect to 
ensure a seamless and comfortable experience 
for patients during their stay.
This allows her to maintain a comfortable 
lifestyle while expanding her influence among 
Tamil Nadu's elite and beyond. In addition to 
her business ventures, Janaki has cultivated 
a network of powerful contacts in Chennai, 
building close ties with controversial, pro-
LTTE politicians such as Nedumaran, Seeman, 
and Vaiko—figures who continue to wield 
significant influence in Tamil Nadu's political 
landscape.
The Question of Betrayal
"While Janaki ensured the best education for 
her children and secured them a comfortable, 
affluent life in Chennai, why is she now 
trying to use us for her pro-LTTE diaspora-
sponsored agendas?" several former female 
LTTE fighters expressed their frustrations 
to Jaffna Monitor. One ex-fighter remarked 
bitterly, "For years, Janaki kept a low profile, 
staying silent and uninvolved. Now that 
her children are settled and thriving, she's 
suddenly rekindled her obsession with Tamil 
Eelam."
These women acknowledged that it is 
natural for any mother to want the best for 
her children. "That's understandable," one 
fighter admitted. "She gave them a good 
education and built a secure life for them. But 
why should our children have to suffer, face 
imprisonment, or even die for these diaspora-
sponsored schemes?"
"It's perfectly fine that she ensured her 
children's bright future," another ex-fighter 
added. "But why did she manipulate us to 
serve the agendas of her sponsors? Why are we 
being treated as mere tools for these plans?"
The fighters expressed deep frustration with 
Janaki's attempts to exploit them, especially 
after guaranteeing the safety and success of her 
own family. "We fought. We lost everything. 
All we want now is peace," one fighter

declared. "Why should we—or our children—
pay the price for these diaspora-funded 
schemes? Haven't we lost enough already?"
A former Sothiya Regiment LTTE fighter, her 
voice tinged with sadness, shared her account 
with Jaffna Monitor.
 "Janaki's husband, Thinesh Master's personal 
bodyguard, now lives in abject poverty," she 
revealed. In the LTTE, a 'bodyguard' wasn't 
merely tasked with protecting the leader. He 
was expected to serve the family in every 
possible way—washing clothes, cleaning the 
house, and even ferrying the children to and 
from school. It was more akin to being an 
unpaid servant than an elite protector.
"This bodyguard devoted himself to Janaki's 
family and children, ensuring their safety 
and comfort," the former fighter recalled. "I 
personally saw him working in her home." Yet, 
after the war, his life unraveled into poverty. 
Despite Janaki's powerful connections and 
access to diaspora funds from pro-LTTE 
elements, she has never once extended a 
helping hand.
"He gave everything to her family, but now, 
with all the influence and resources she 
possesses, she hasn't lifted a finger to support 
him," the former fighter lamented.
Another former female LTTE leader shed 
light on what she described as Janaki's 
opportunistic behavior. She pointed out that 
Janaki's mother and her younger sister both 
live comfortably in Kilinochi, while other close 
relatives remain safe in Jaffna. The ex-fighter 
accused Janaki of ensuring her family's safety 
while using vulnerable former fighters to push 
her pro-LTTE diaspora agenda.
"If Janaki were truly sincere, why wouldn't 
she involve her own mother, sister, or other 
relatives in these schemes?" she asked. "Deep 
down, she knows that their involvement would 
invite trouble. To avoid that risk, she shields 
them while exploiting us—those of us without 
any protection."
"Janaki's attitude seems to be—' Who cares 
about the rest of us?'" the ex-fighter concluded 
bitterly.
"If Janaki were truly sincere, why doesn't she 
involve her own mother, sister, or any of her 
close relatives in these schemes?" she asked, 
her voice heavy with frustration. "Deep down, 
she knows their involvement would invite 
trouble—trouble she's not willing to face. To 
avoid that risk, she keeps them shielded and 
safe, while exploiting us—the ones with no 
protection, no safety net. We're disposable to 
her, mere pawns in her game."
Her tone sharpened, bitterness dripping 
from every word. "Janaki's attitude seems to 
be—'Who cares about the rest of us?' As long 
as she gets what she wants, we can suffer for 
all she cares." The ex-fighter's words cut deep, 
exposing the betrayal and abandonment that 
had simmered beneath the surface for years.
She paused, her gaze distant, before delivering 
her final point with unwavering clarity. "Janaki 
knew it all along—Prabhakaran was the LTTE, 
and the LTTE was Prabhakaran. Without him, 
there is no LTTE, no structure, no cause left 
to hold on to. She knows that all too well. And 
yet, here she is, rekindling dead embers, using 
us to chase a dream that ended long ago. She's 
playing with our memories, reopening old 
wounds—not for justice, but to keep her Tamil 
Eelam fantasies alive—dreams we can no 
longer afford to follow."
Her voice dropped into cold resolve. "In the 
end, it's not about us. It never was. We're just 
tools—used, discarded, and now summoned 
again to serve her agenda. And this time, she 
doesn't care if we shatter completely."
