T
henmozhi (name changed) was a valiant 
LTTE fighter from the Sothiya Regiment. 
She fought fiercely for her cause, but on May 
17, 2009, when everything fell apart, she faced 
a life-altering decision: either bite the cyanide 
capsule, as was expected of a Tiger fighter or 
surrender to the very army she had fought 
against for years. She chose the latter.
Surrender was never an option in the LTTE's 
lexicon, but Thenmozhi tells us she made that 
choice because there was nothing left to fight 
for. As a mother of two, with her husband 
already killed in battle, she felt there was no 
point in continuing the struggle. She joined 
the ranks of 12,000 other LTTE fighters, 
leaders, and cadres who laid down their arms 
and surrendered to the military. Thenmozhi 
entered a rehabilitation program and 
eventually settled on the outskirts of Jaffna, 
where she now ekes out a living doing menial 
jobs to raise her children.
Then, out of the blue, in early 2023, she 
received a call from an unfamiliar Indian 
number, +9199400194 (the last two digits 
are purposefully withheld). To her surprise, 
the voice on the other end belonged to 
Kavery Akka (Name Changed), one of her 
former senior commanders in the Sothiya 
Regiment—a woman she had always admired 
for her kindness and leadership. It was a 
pleasant shock. Kaveri seemed genuinely 
interested in Thenmozhi's well-being and, 
in an unexpected gesture, asked for her 
bank details. Being a self-respecting woman, 
Thenmozhi initially refused, but after repeated 
calls, she reluctantly shared them. Days later, 
she received a deposit of a few thousand 
rupees from Kaveri.
Kaveri began asking Thenmozhi to reconnect 
with other former female fighters in her 
village and nearby areas, saying that she 
wanted to help them. Moved by the gesture, 
Thenmozhi poured her heart into it, reaching 
out to her former comrades, many of whom 
were now leading quiet, unremarkable, and 
impoverished lives. She managed to locate 
around 30 former fighters. True to her word, 
Kaveri helped the majority of the fighters 
Thenmozhi introduced. Kaveri insisted that 
her name not be mentioned. Instead, Kaveri 
asked Thenmozhi to tell the fighters that the 
help came from generous Tamil diaspora 
members.
Thenmozhi was astonished—she had always 
thought the diaspora, who once funded 
their fight, had abandoned them after the 
war. Yet here they were, quietly offering 
support. Though the financial assistance 
was modest, it brought a sense of relief and

hope to the women who had felt forgotten. 
Kaveri continued to encourage Thenmozhi to 
build her network, and each time she found 
someone new, Kaveri would send more funds.
However, as the presidential election 
approached, things took a darker turn.
Kaveri urged Thenmozhi to rally her network 
in support of the so-called common Tamil 
candidate, convincing her that it was crucial 
to show Tamil solidarity through their vote. 
Feeling a sense of duty, Thenmozhi took time 
off from her menial job to tirelessly campaign 
for the candidate, never questioning her 
motives. It wasn't until after the election that 
she began to have doubts.
One day, kaveri called again, this time with 
a troubling request. She wanted information 
about someone who was known to be a vocal 
critic of the LTTE. That's when alarm bells 
rang in Thenmozhi's mind. She began to 
realize that she might have been caught in a 
carefully laid trap, with her emotional and 
financial vulnerabilities being exploited for a 
larger agenda.
Fearing what might come next, Thenmozhi 
cut all ties with Kaveri. She stopped using the 
phone number linked to their communications 
and distanced herself from the network she 
had helped build. What became of the group of 
former fighters is unknown to her.
Kayalvizhi's Story
Kayalvizhi—let's call her that—was once a 
committed fighter in the Malathi Regiment 
of the LTTE. After the war ended in May 
2009, she surrendered to the Sri Lankan army 
alongside thousands of other fighters. She

spent several years in a rehabilitation program 
before resettling in Vavuniya (place changed), 
the town she and her husband called home. 
Life after the war was peaceful—perhaps too 
peaceful. They focused on farming and raising 
livestock, building a modest but quiet life free 
from the shadows of conflict.
Kayalvizhi had made a conscious decision to 
bury her past and spend the rest of her life in 
peace. Her only goal was to care for her family, 
raise her children, and avoid anything that 
might disrupt the fragile stability they had 
built. But that peace was about to be tested.
A few years ago, Kayalvizhi received a call 
from 077657... (the last four digits of the phone 
number have been withheld deliberately) 
that would soon upend her meticulously 
crafted life. On the other end was a familiar 
voice—Bhuvana (name changed), a former 
leader from one of the LTTE's non-combatant 
divisions. Once an LTTE fighter, Bhuvana told 
Kayalvizhi that she was now collaborating with 
diaspora contacts who were offering financial 
assistance to struggling ex-combatants.
At first, Kayalvizhi was deeply suspicious. 
Accepting funds linked to the LTTE felt like 
inviting trouble, and the last thing she wanted 
was to endanger her family. For years, she had 
intentionally kept her distance from former 
comrades, following her instincts to avoid 
unnecessary complications. Yet, the timing of 
Bhuvana's offer was hard to ignore—her family 
needed funds for urgent home repairs and to 
rebuild their hen coops. Though they lived 
frugally, times were tough.
Kayalvizhi voiced her reservations to Bhuvana, 
explaining that she was reluctant to accept 
money from any LTTE-affiliated diaspora 
group. But Bhuvana was persistent. She 
assured Kayalvizhi that the funds came from 
a genuine, independent diaspora family with 
no political strings attached. "There's nothing 
to worry about," Bhuvana insisted. Reluctantly, 
and with some hesitation, Kayalvizhi agreed. 
A few days later, 20,000 rupees were deposited 
into her bank account.
After the first deposit, Bhuvana asked 
Kayalvizhi to reach out to other former female 
fighters in her area, saying she wanted to help 
them as well. Kayalvizhi hesitated. She had 
deliberately avoided contact with her former 
comrades for years, not wanting to stir up 
old memories or draw unwanted attention. 
But Bhuvana continued to encourage her. 
Eventually, motivated by the idea that she 
could make a difference in the lives of other 
ex-fighters, Kayalvizhi gave in.
She reached out to former fighters in her 
village and neighboring areas, gathering their 
phone numbers, addresses, and other personal 
information. Over time, she built a small 
network of ex-LTTE fighters. Once she shared 
the information with Bhuvana, she was asked 
to take on a leadership role, coordinating 
the group and acting as a liaison between 
the fighters and Bhuvana. With Bhuvana's 
occasional financial support, Kayalvizhi was 
able to assist several women in the group by 
distributing modest but essential aid.
For a while, things seemed to be going 
smoothly. But everything changed when the 
presidential election was announced.
Bhuvana returned with a new request—she 
wanted Kayalvizhi and her group not just to 
vote for the "common Tamil candidate" but 
to actively campaign for him. Bhuvana, in 
an attempt to entice her, also drew a parallel 
between the conch symbol used by the so-
called common Tamil candidate and the 
emblem of the Malathi Regiment, which also 
features a conch. Kayalvizhi was taken aback. 
This was far from what she had signed up for.

canvassing for the Common 
Tamil candidate. Her network 
of former fighters also joined 
the campaign, driven by the 
same sense of loyalty and the 
weight of the proverb. What 
began as a simple support for 
her comrades turned into a 
political mission she never 
intended to undertake.
After the election, however, 
Kayalvizhi sensed that 
something far more sinister 
was unfolding. It became 
clear that Bhuvana's motives 
went beyond simply helping 
former fighters—she was 
quietly assembling a network 
that could be activated at 
any moment, advancing 
the hidden agenda of LTTE 
diaspora elements long intent 
on stirring unrest in Sri Lanka. 
Kayalvizhi also realized that 
Bhuvana wasn't acting alone; 
she suspected a mastermind 
within the diaspora was 
orchestrating the operation 
from behind the scenes. Their 
ultimate objective seemed 
to be creating a tightly-knit 
network of former LTTE 
fighters, offering just enough 
aid to secure their loyalty—
only to manipulate them 
later for a far larger and more 
dangerous agenda.
Kayalvizhi told us that if she 
stayed involved, she risked 
being drawn deeper into a 
web of dangerous schemes, 
jeopardizing both her family 
and the fragile peace she had 
She had left politics behind long ago, believing that their 
struggle had ended the day their leader, Prabhakaran, was 
killed.
Kayalvizhi explained to Jaffna Monitor that her sole purpose 
in building the network was to support former fighters—not 
to engage in political activism. To her, politics was a dead 
end, and she had no faith in the so-called common Tamil 
candidate. "It's not right for me to get involved in politics," 
she told Bhuvana. "I don't trust these candidates, and I don't 
believe any of this will benefit our people."
That's when Bhuvana's tone changed. The warmth and 
kindness in her voice vanished, replaced by a cold, 
commanding edge. She reminded Kayalvizhi of the financial 
help she had accepted, subtly implying that it came with 
unspoken obligations. In that moment, Kayalvizhi felt 
trapped. A Tamil proverb perfectly encapsulates her 
predicament: "ef;Fz;lhu; ehtpoe;jhu;"-loosely translated 
as, "Once you've accepted help from someone, you lose the 
right to speak against them."
Under mounting pressure and a sense of indebtedness, 
Kayalvizhi reluctantly agreed to support the campaign. 
Despite her better judgment, she threw herself into

fought so hard to protect.
Without a second thought, 
Kayalvizhi severed all ties 
with Bhuvana. She changed 
her phone number and 
abandoned the network she 
had painstakingly built. What 
became of the group of former 
fighters she organized remains 
a mystery to her. She suspects 
that Bhuvana found someone 
else to step into her place, 
continuing to exploit others 
under the guise of help.
Baited by Poverty: The Sinister 
Plan to Ensnare Former 
Fighters into a Dangerous 
Agenda
A former fighter—let's call 
him Thuyavan—who had 
direct dealings with these 
elements revealed unsettling 
details to Jaffna Monitor. 
He recounted how he was 
pulled into this sinister 
scheme by Janaki, the former 
administrative head of the 
LTTE's Sothiya Regiment, 
who now resides comfortably 
in Chennai. "It all started 
innocently," Thuyavan said, 
"but before I knew it, I was 
entangled in something."
According to Thuyavan, the 
person overseeing operations 
on the ground—essentially 
functioning as a team leader—
was Mani, a former LTTE 
fighter (a pseudonym used to 
protect her identity). "She was 
my primary contact, running 
the show," he explained. "But 
Mani wasn't just a go-between; she led the local network cell 
I was involved with." He added ominously, "And there may 
be many other cells—many other Manis."
Thuyavan revealed that all coordination with Mani took 
place through a specific phone number—077334… (we've 
withheld the last four digits for privacy). However, what 
troubled him most was her current situation. "The saddest 
part," he said, "is that Mani still does menial jobs—cleaning 
to make ends meet."
He couldn't help but wonder if Janaki had manipulated 
Mani into the network. "It feels like she's been brainwashed," 
Thuyavan reflected. "It's hard to believe that someone like 
Mani, working herself to exhaustion just to survive, is now

trapped in this web—doing whatever the 
network demands, without question."
But what struck Thuyavan the most was when 
Janaki created a WhatsApp group to organize 
the network's activities. As new members were 
added, one number immediately caught his 
attention—+33 652 853 895, a French number. 
"I had a bad feeling," he admitted. "When I 
looked into it, I found out that the number 
belonged to Achchuthan, a former operative 
from the LTTE's air wing. From what I know 
through friends, Achchuthan is hell-bent on 
reviving the LTTE," Thuyavan revealed.
This discovery deeply unsettled him. "That's 
when I realized," he said grimly, "this wasn't 
just about helping ex-fighters. There was a 
much darker, far-reaching agenda at play—
something far more sinister than I initially 
thought."
With regret heavy in his voice, Thuyavan 
acknowledged how deeply the network had 
grown. "I see now that poverty and promises 
were just tools to lure us back into a world we 
thought we'd escaped. And if this keeps going," 
he added, "it won't be long before everything 
unravels, dragging us back into the chaos we 
fought so hard to leave behind."
"It's clear that influential LTTE figures, who 
escaped the war and now live comfortably 
abroad, are working to establish a well-
organized network of former fighters to serve 
their personal agenda—the revival of the 
LTTE," said a former LTTE leader, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. He elaborated further: 
"They know full well that without Prabhakaran, 
the LTTE cannot truly be revived. But 
these individuals, now settled overseas and 
benefiting from both leftover LTTE funds and 
fresh diaspora money, want to fuel unrest in 
Sri Lanka. Chaos allows them to thrive abroad, 
collecting more funds under the pretense of a 
renewed struggle."
"For years, these diaspora elements relied 
heavily on local politicians—particularly 
the TNPF and factions within the TNA and 
ITAK—to push their agendas. But even these 
politicians have their limits. Realizing this, the 
diaspora now aims to build a tightly controlled 
network of former fighters-people they can 
manipulate from afar, whether for political 
gain or something far more dangerous," the 
source, who is deeply knowledgeable about the 
situation, told Jaffna Monitor.
"Most of the former LTTE fighters living in 
Sri Lanka are innocent," he explained. "They 
fought for a cause they once believed in, but 
they've since buried their past and moved on. 
Now, they live simple, ordinary lives. For them, 
the war, the struggle—it's all behind them. 
All they want is to live in peace." However, 
the source stressed that this longing for peace 
is being cynically exploited by LTTE figures 
abroad.
"These former fighters aren't willingly stepping 
into the carefully crafted web. The diaspora 
uses their poverty as bait—offering small 
financial aid and token gestures, pretending to 
care, while slowly ensnaring them emotionally. 
It's a calculated manipulation, reeling them in 
little by little, only to use them later for hidden 
agendas," he said, his tone grim.
The ex-fighter expressed deep sorrow over 
the potential consequences for those being 
manipulated. "These men and women already 
lost everything in the war. They've rebuilt 
fragile, quiet lives, free from violence, hoping 
never to return to that darkness. But now, 
these diaspora LTTE figures are dragging them 
back into a game they don't want to play. If 
this continues, they won't just lose the peace 
they've fought so hard to find—they'll lose 
everything all over again."
