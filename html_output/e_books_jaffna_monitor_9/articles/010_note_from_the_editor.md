Let it be clear: we bear no ill will toward Achchuthan or Janaki. Despite the 
chaos and suffering endured by the Tamil people under the LTTE’s leadership, 
we hold the fighters in high regard. These individuals, guided by what they 
believed was just, took up arms with the conviction that they were defending 
us. For that, we extend our gratitude—irrespective of whether the outcome 
was right or wrong. Their intentions, though burdened with consequence, 
were rooted in a profound desire for protection and a relentless will for 
freedom.
Achchuthan, in his youth, While many of his peers around the world indulged 
in leisure and youthful distractions, chose a path he believed in. he went 
abroad to study and become a pilot for the LTTE. Similarly, Janaki was drawn 
into a cause she believed in at a very young age, giving everything to what she 
saw as a noble fight. We recognize their sacrifices and do not take them lightly.
But May 2009 marked the end of that chapter. The LTTE was not only defeated 
but buried under the weight of its own inhumane mistakes. Thousands of 
LTTE fighters surrendered to the very military they had once fought against. 
After enduring unimaginable hardships, these former fighters have now found 
peace and lead quiet lives.
As responsible Tamils, we cannot allow this hard-earned peace and tranquility 
to be jeopardized by a handful of diaspora opportunists pursuing selfish 
agendas. For people like Achchuthan and Janaki, Tamil Eelam is little more 
than an itch they scratch whenever it suits them. But when they do, it is 
our former fighters and the Tamil community in Sri Lanka who suffer—not 
Achchuthan, not Janaki, nor the diaspora agitators enjoying comfortable lives 
abroad.
We will not stand idly by and allow this to unfold. We will do whatever it takes 
to prevent it—that is our resolve. Our duty and conscience are clear: to protect 
our former fighters, who—right or wrong—took up arms for us. And we will 
go to any length to ensure they are neither used, manipulated, nor put in 
harm’s way.
