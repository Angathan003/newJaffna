n the decades since the Jaffna Public 
Library was reduced to ashes-its 
nearly 97,000 books and manuscripts 
deliberately set alight in what remains 
one of the most egregious acts of 
cultural genocide in Sri Lankan 
history-a quiet yet determined 
renaissance has taken root. A new 
generation of Sri Lankan Tamils, both 
at home and across the diaspora, has 
come together to build a library that no 
racist mob can ever burn again.
That library is Noolaham.org-Tamil 
for "repository of books." Today, 
this expansive digital archive holds 
more than one and a half times the 
number of documents, books, and rare 
manuscripts that once lined the shelves 
of the destroyed Jaffna Public Library.
More than just a collection of texts, 
Noolaham.org stands as a defiant digital 
middle finger to the state-sponsored 
arsonists and chauvinist forces who 
once tried to incinerate a people’s 
memory and intellectual heritage.  
This vital digital repository of Tamil 
knowledge cannot be looted, cannot 
be banned, and certainly cannot be set 
ablaze. It's a defiant act of preservation, 
ensuring that the rich tapestry of 
Tamil culture and intellect endures, 
unyielding against the flames of 
oppression.

The First Sparks of a Digital Renaissance
In the 1990s, as computers began to flicker to life 
across South Asia and its diaspora, a quiet digital 
awakening was taking root among Tamil scholars 
and tech enthusiasts. Inspired by global initiatives 
like Project Gutenberg, a handful of Tamil 
visionaries began to imagine a future where their 
literary heritage could be preserved online.
The turning point came in 1998 with the launch 
of Project Madurai-the first online Tamil digital 
library, modeled after Project Gutenberg. It was a 
modest, volunteer-driven initiative, but it marked 
a bold leap into the digital era. A year later, in 
1999, R. Pathmanaba Iyer, widely regarded as the 
pioneer of Sri Lankan Tamil digitization, began 
digitalizing Sri Lankan Tamil books. He digitized 
40 titles-13 of which were later contributed to 
Project Madurai, marking the earliest known 
integration of Sri Lankan Tamil literature into a 
global digital archive.
In the early 2000s, with growing access to personal 
computers and the internet, Small but determined 
projects like Eelanool and E‐Suvadi emerged 
between 2004 and 2005, quietly digitizing Sri 
Lankan Tamil publications with whatever tools, 
time, and bandwidth their volunteers could 
muster. These efforts were scattered and largely

uncoordinated-but their importance was 
undeniable. Together, these early experiments 
lit the path toward something far more 
ambitious and enduring.
The Birth of Project Noolaham: A 
Community’s Digital Leap
In January 2005, a new chapter in the 
preservation of Sri Lankan Tamil heritage 
quietly began with the launch of Project 
Noolaham, founded by Thillainathan Kopinath 
and Muralitharan Mauran. The initiative 
built upon and integrated earlier digitization 
efforts-most notably the pioneering work of 
R. Pathmanaba Iyer. It also incorporated the 
contributions of Eelanool.
By August 31, 2005, the formation of the 
Noolaham Google Group brought together 
a vibrant network of contributors, laying 
the groundwork for what would become a 
global volunteer movement. Pathmanaba 
Iyer was appointed an advisor to the project. 
Others like K.T. Pratheepa, P. Eelanathan, 
K. Raminitharan, Mathy Kandasamy, L. 
Natkeeran, and Kanaga Sritharan soon joined. 
The project also attracted the support of S. 
Thevaraja, representing the Thesiya Kalai 
Ilakkiyap Peravai, whose organization agreed 
to contribute its materials to Noolaham.
To support this growing initiative, Noolaham 
purchased its first server in August 2005. By 
the end of 2005, the digitized archive had 
crossed its first major milestone: 100 books 
preserved and accessible online.
They Were Born When the Library 
Burned
When asked how it came to be that many of 
the founders of the Noolaham initiative were 
of a similar age, Kopinath offered a reflection.

“Those who worked with us-Eelanathan, 
Natkeeran, Mayuran, myself, Shaseevan-we 
were all roughly the same age. Born within 
a few years of each other, between 1980 and 
1982,” he told Jaffna Monitor. “When you 
ask that question, it strikes me-we were all 
born around the time we lost the Jaffna Public 
Library.”
“We were in our early twenties in the early 
2000s. Coincidentally, that was when 
computers-though still expensive-were 
becoming just about accessible. Unicode was 
gaining ground, and around 2001, Wikipedia 
entered the scene. We were the right age, at 
the right time.”
“That was when we were just getting 
introduced to computers, learning to type, 
and experimenting with platforms like 
Blogspot. If we had been 15, we’d still have 
been in school. If we’d been 25, we might 
have been caught up with jobs, families, and 
responsibilities. But at 20-you feel that drive, 
that energy to start something. To act.”
The Bold Reinvention of Noolaham
The man widely credited with transforming 
Noolaham from a volunteer-based initiative 
into a formidable institution is Shaseevan 
Ganeshananthan, now a software entrepreneur 
living in the UK. Speaking to Jaffna Monitor, 
he traced the turning point back to his school 
days.
“Kopi-Thillainathan Kopinath-and I were 
classmates at Jaffna Hindu College from 
the sixth standard. After our A/Ls, we even 
brought out a little magazine together called 
,ir GjpJ -A New Direction,” he recalled. 
“In 2006, just as Project Noolaham was 
finding its feet, Kopi had to leave for Malaysia 
to pursue higher studies. It became painfully 
clear to us that if Kopi left, the entire project 
could grind to a halt.”
Though Shaseevan had previously volunteered 
with Noolaham, it was only in July 2007, 
that Kopinath formally handed over the 
coordinating role to him. “In my mind,” 
Shaseevan said, “if something has to be done, 
it must be done in a structured way. One of 
the biggest problems I see in our society 
is that good initiatives-especially those 
driven by community passion-remain small 
because they’re not structured. They’re not 
institutionalized. So they can’t scale.”
The Birth of the Noolaham Foundation
Shaseevan set about transforming Noolaham 
from a purely volunteer-run effort into a 
structured, project-centered organization. 
For the first time, the idea of paid staff was 
introduced. Until then, every single page had 
been digitized by volunteers working from 
homes, rooms, hostels, and sometimes even 
internet cafés.
But such change didn’t come without

resistance. “There was pushback internally,” he 
admitted. “And I understood where it came from. 
Around that time, the global conversation was heavily 
influenced by models like Wikipedia and the Free 
Software Foundation. They stood for flat hierarchies, 
pure volunteerism, and anarchic collaboration. Many 
within Noolaham were drawn to that ethos and wanted 
to preserve it.”
“But once you start 
institutionalizing,” he added, 
“hierarchy becomes inevitable. 
You need structure."
Thankfully, Kopi supported the 
shift. He had spent years manually 
digitizing books-typing and 
scanning them page by page. He 
understood the amount of labor it 
took.
Then came an idea that somewhat 
rewrote the script. “With 
donations, we bought 16 scanners-
each costing about Rs. 3,000 at 
the time,” Shaseevan explained. 
“We gave them to 16 university 
students, with one condition: each 
had to scan 3,000 pages. Once 
they met that target, the scanner 
was theirs.”

It was a simple bargain-but it worked like 
magic, Shaseevan explained to Jaffna Monitor. 
“At that point, we didn’t even have a proper 
office, But that one move brought in a new 
kind of energy. The students took ownership. 
The digitization rate exploded. The project 
had found its second wind.”
By the time 2007 drew to a close, the numbers 
told their own story. When Shaseevan took 
over, Noolaham had 406 digitized books. By 
the end of the year, that number had ballooned 
to 1,618.
The methods evolved too. “We introduced 
editing and post-processing,” he said. “Earlier 
scans were often raw-some pages crooked, 
some smudged. We cleaned them up. We made 
sure what we published was readable and 
complete. If we digitized a book, we also tried 
to track down related material.” What came 
next was the biggest leap yet. “Until then, we 
were mostly scanning literary works,” he said. 
“We asked-why stop there? Why not preserve 
magazines, newspapers, research papers, 
and even event souvenirs? Why not build a 
complete record of Tamil printed history?”
And so, in 2008, the project took a bold new 
turn. Shaseevan laid the groundwork for what 
would eventually become the Noolaham 
Foundation. That same year, the Foundation’s 
first Board of Trustees was formally 
appointed, with R. Pathmanaba Iyer serving as 
Chairperson, Shaseevan as Coordinator, and 
five others-including Kopinath-contributing 
as directors. In May 2010, the initiative was 
officially registered under GA 2390, marking 
the formal birth of the Noolaham Foundation.

"Giving Everything to Everyone”: How 
Noolaham Challenges Tamil Norms 
Around Knowledge
“What sets our library apart-perhaps the most 
significant aspect-is that we went against a 
deeply ingrained Tamil mindset,” explains 
Kopinath. “We made everything open access. 
Free for everyone. In truth, the idea of openly 
sharing information has never been part of 
Tamil culture. We tend to be hoarders of 
knowledge-guarding it, preserving it, but not 
necessarily sharing it.” Noolaham was built 
in direct opposition to that mentality. “We’re 
here to give everything to everyone,” he says.
“Every society functions in its own way. In 
our community, knowledge has traditionally 
been passed down through songs, stories, and 
oral traditions. That’s how it reaches the next 
generation. So, I wouldn’t say we entirely lack 
a documentation culture-but it’s certainly not 
strong or structured".
"We’ve never really had a comprehensive, 
archival approach to preserving our collective 
memory.” “But today’s world operates largely 
within a Western framework,” he continues. 
“If we want our history and identity to 
survive-and to be acknowledged-on the global 
stage, then we have to engage with that model 
of documentation.” “That’s exactly what we 
did,” he told Jaffna Monitor.
“What About Us?”: The Missing Archive of 
Our Own Pain
Take Australia, where I now live,” says 
Kopinath. “White settlers committed 
massacres against Aboriginal people, carried 
out atrocities, and implemented the ‘Stolen 
Generations’ policy-where Aboriginal children 
were forcibly removed from their families 
and raised in white institutions. But there was 
extensive documentation. That’s why today, 
their genocide is acknowledged: the evidence 
exists.”
“But what about us?” he reflected. “What have 
we documented about 2009? Even now, we 
haven’t done it right.”
Roadmap 2020
In 2012, Noolaham developed its first 
Strategic Plan (2012–2014) alongside a long-
term Roadmap-2020. At the heart of that 
roadmap was an audacious goal: to digitize 
97,000 documents by the end of 2020.
At first glance, the number seemed more 
like a dream than a realistic target. But as 
Shaseevan explained to Jaffna Monitor, there 
was deep symbolism behind it. “The Jaffna 
Public Library was burned with 97,000 books 
inside,” he said. “So we chose that number 
not just as a target-but as a way of quietly 
reclaiming what was lost.”
In 2012, Noolaham had only 12,000 digitized 
documents. The idea of archiving another 
85,000 within eight years felt almost absurd. 
“We laughed when we drafted the plan,” 
Shaseevan admitted. “Logically, it didn’t 
make sense. It had taken us seven years to 
digitize 12,000 items, and yet we were setting 
a goal that was seven times greater within 
nearly the same span.”
But the team did more than dream. “We 
created a roadmap-a strategic plan with clear 
timelines, targets, and methods. Looking back 
now, we didn’t just wish. We engineered a 
way to get there,” he said.
Against all odds, they did. By the end of 2020, 
Noolaham had reached the milestone: 97,000 
documents digitized-matching exactly the 
number lost in the burning of the Jaffna Public 
Library.

Noolaham and the Long Shadow of 
Jaffna’s Loss
When Jaffna Monitor asked whether 
Noolaham could be seen as a response to the 
1981 burning of the Jaffna Public Library, 
Kopinath recalled that when Noolaham’s first 
website (noolaham.org) was launched in 2005, 
it featured an image of the burned library on 
its homepage. Although that version of the site 
is no longer active, the symbolism, he said, 
was deliberate.
“So yes,” Kopinath told Jaffna Monitor, 
“whether consciously or unconsciously, 
the urge to respond to the loss of the Jaffna 
Library was definitely within us.”
Yet he was quick to draw a distinction. “It 
would be wrong to say that Noolaham is a 
direct replacement for the Jaffna Library. 
There was certainly a communal desire to 
respond-to protect our records, to build a 
library that wouldn’t drown in a flood or burn 
in a fire. That feeling was in the air when we 
started.”
For many, the destruction of the Jaffna Library 
remains a powerful emotional trigger. “It’s 
etched deeply in the collective conscience 
of our people. You could say it wounded the 
Tamil soul,” Kopinath said.
But Noolaham, he emphasized, was 
also born from a deeper realization: the 
community’s lack of an archival culture. “Our 
community doesn’t have a strong instinct 
for documentation. Yesterday’s newspaper is 
forgotten by today. So our goal became: let’s 
build a culture of preservation. Let’s archive 
whatever we can.”
Fundraising, however, has never been easy. 
“You can easily raise funds for an elders’ 
home, a school, or a temple,” he noted. “But 
when you tell someone you’re publishing a 
book or digitizing old documents, fundraising 
becomes extremely difficult.” Still, around 
400 to 500 individuals continue to contribute 
financially every year. According to Kopinath, 
for many of them, the emotional catalyst-the 
reason they give regularly-is the memory of 
the burning of the Jaffna Library.

few others, dedicated the prime years of their 
youth to building Noolaham. In an era when 
they could have easily focused on launching 
private ventures or advancing their careers, 
they chose instead to invest their time, energy, 
and talent in a cause larger than themselves. 
It was a question Jaffna Monitor felt 
compelled to ask: what drove such a profound 
commitment?
“It was a critical communal need-to preserve 
our people’s records, books, and memories,” 
Kopinath said. “Someone had to step up and 
take responsibility. Our documents weren’t 
just lost by accident-they were deliberately 
destroyed. And sadly, due to our own 
negligence, documentation has never been a 
systematic part of our culture.”
Kopinath believes the work of Noolaham 
fills a longstanding void. “We see it as a vital 
responsibility-to collect, safeguard, and pass 
on our people’s records to the next generation. 
For us, this is an ethnic duty. Even if those 
involved don’t fully recognize it in the 
moment, when you step back and look at the 
bigger picture, that’s exactly what it is.”
He noted that Sri Lankan Tamil society has 
not historically prioritized archiving or record-
keeping. “That’s precisely why this work 
became essential,” he said. “At some point, it 
felt like holding a tiger by the tail-we simply 
couldn’t let go. The project had grown so 
large, so complex, that creating something of 
this scale again would be nearly impossible.”
He added, “This is a massive responsibility. 
If a new generation steps up and truly takes 
ownership, we’ll gladly hand it over and step 
back. But that moment hasn’t come yet.”
Shaseevan shared a deeply personal story 
that reveals the extent of commitment and 
sacrifice that underpinned the project. “When 
I first took up the responsibility in 2007, my 
plan was simple,” he told Jaffna Monitor. “I 
thought I would give two solid years-2007 and 
2008-to help stabilize and sustain Noolaham, 
and then I’d move on.”
But that plan quickly changed. “I ended up 
staying until 2015 as Executive Director. That 
was a crucial period in my life, especially 
in terms of my academic and professional 
development. I had to let go of my career 
path in the field I had originally studied,” he 
reflected. “That’s actually how I moved into 
business-there was a gap in my professional 
trajectory because of this commitment.”
We wanted to Build an Ideological 
Fortress.
“Another reason for doing this was to create 
an ideological fortress,” said Shaseevan, 
reflecting on the larger purpose behind 
Noolaham’s work. “I believe a fortress built 
on ideas is far stronger than one built with 
weapons or ethnic sentiment.”
Shaseevan said the vision behind Noolaham 
was not only to archive documents but to 
foster a form of activism rooted in knowledge. 
“Initially, most of what we preserved was 
literary in nature. But I chose to include 
Economic Review, the publication of People’s 
Bank, in our archive. MLM Mansoor-a 
brilliant banker and Tamil writer-was the 
Tamil co-editor of that publication. That 
marked the first time we brought an economic 
perspective into Tamil archival work.”
He explained how the project matured over 
time: “We began by archiving literature, 
then moved into political publications. But 
literature and politics alone do not define a 
society. A community is far more complex.
Gradually, our scope expanded. It became 
more diverse and inclusive.”
“I believe the knowledge we produce and

preserve this way will one day take its 
rightful, central place in society,” he said.
“What If It Disappears Tomorrow?” 
The Question of Digital Permanence
Given the painful collective memory of the 
Jaffna Public Library’s destruction in 1981, 
a natural question arises: can Noolaham, 
the digital archive born from that loss, be 
destroyed too? What if a cyberattack were to 
wipe it out overnight?
When Jaffna Monitor posed this question to 
Kopinath, he responded with calm assurance. 
“Anyone can download the entire digital 
collection if they wish to,” he said. “In fact, 
many already have. The content exists in 
multiple locations, and in some cases, the 
entire archive has been mirrored.”
Unlike traditional libraries housed in 
vulnerable buildings, Noolaham is 
intentionally decentralized. It exists not just 
as a website, but as a distributed knowledge 
system safeguarded across multiple formats 
and geographies. “Our content is backed up 
in several ways-cloud servers, external hard 
drives, and even physical storage in secure 
bank lockers,” Kopinath explained. “Even if 
the main site were taken offline, the archive 
would still live on.”
To further protect its holdings, Noolaham has 
partnered with institutions such as the British 
Library and maintains backups stored abroad. 
These offline and international redundancies 
are part of a comprehensive strategy to ensure 
continuity, even in the face of cyber threats or 
geopolitical disruption.
Grassroots Funding and Radical 
Transparency: The Noolaham Model
In its formative years (2005–2007), Noolaham 
operated without a formal budget. Volunteers

contributed personal equipment, and core 
expenses-like server and domain costs-were 
covered out of pocket. As the initiative grew, 
it began to rely on small-scale donations 
from the global Tamil diaspora. “Most of our 
funds come from small donations-$10 or £10-
from many supporters,” said one long-time 
volunteer. This decentralized, community-
driven model has ensured widespread 
ownership and helped the archive avoid 
dependence on any single benefactor.
By 2009, Noolaham formalized a monthly 
sponsorship scheme, where 12 donors-often 
cultural associations or alumni networks-
would each fund a month’s operational 
costs. Alongside this, the organization 
began securing institutional grants for 
specific projects. Support from the Neelan 
Tiruchelvam Trust, the U.S. State Department, 
the British Library’s Endangered Archives 
Programme (EAP), and the Wikimedia 
Foundation has enabled major undertakings, 
including the digitization of palm-leaf 
manuscripts and multimedia documentation 
initiatives.
However, Noolaham remains clear-eyed 
about the limits of project-based funding. 
As Shaseevan explained to Jaffna Monitor, 
“There have been historical cases where 
an entire organization ended up as the de 
facto property of a businessperson simply 
because they funded it. We didn’t want that to 
happen here.” To safeguard its independence, 
Noolaham ensures that day-to-day operations-
staffing, infrastructure, and maintenance-
are sustained by collective fundraising and 
volunteer-led campaigns, not institutional 
grants.
Transparency as Principle
Transparency is another cornerstone of 
Noolaham’s ethos.“We’re open not just 
financially, but in every operational aspect,” 
said Shaseevan. “The only thing protected is 
the admin password-everything else is in the 
public domain. In doing so, we’ve become a 
model for other organizations.”
"Just as I was firm about making the library 
completely transparent, Kopinath was equally 
insistent that the accounts be watertight-even 
down to the last rupee," said Shaseevan. 
"Kopi’s reasoning was clear: anyone can 
be accused of financial misconduct, so our 
accounting must be impeccable."
Shaseevan added, “I believed that if we 
embraced full transparency, things would 
naturally fall into place. Look at Wikipedia-
early on, they made everything public, even 
internal minutes. Open-source organizations 
also operate with a high degree of openness. 
That inspired us.”
That commitment appears to have paid 
off. “To this day, we haven’t faced a single 
allegation of financial fraud,” another long-
time volunteer noted. “But still, in personal 
conversations, people ask us: what’s the 
benefit of all this? Is there some financial gain 
involved?” The volunteer explained further: 
“Among our people if someone is working 
hard or making sacrifices, the assumption is 
often that there must be some hidden agenda-
financial or political. They find it hard to 
believe anyone would do something purely 
out of conviction.”
A Global Effort: Diaspora, Volunteers, 
and Partnerships Fuel Noolaham’s 
Growth
In many ways, Noolaham functions as 
a transnational organization. While its 
headquarters are in Jaffna, its human 
resources are scattered across the globe, 
wherever Tamil-speaking professionals 
reside. Volunteers coordinate through email,

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
29
WhatsApp, and online forums-and meet in 
person whenever possible.
“Diaspora volunteers are deeply embedded 
in our digitization workflows,” said one 
overseas volunteer. “We have teams based 
in different countries who collect documents 
for the Noolaham repository.” In London, for 
example, a volunteer might salvage Tamil 
books from recycling centers and send them 
in. Some rare books have arrived through 
public libraries, private donors, or even 
parcels mailed in for scanning.
Members of the Tamil diaspora are also 
actively involved in governance, fundraising, 
and technical development. Volunteer hubs 
have emerged in Canada, the UK, and 
Australia-organizing outreach initiatives, 
hosting events, and offering specialist 
expertise. Notably, the 2007 fundraiser in 
California and the 2009 event in Australia 
were led by diaspora groups, underscoring the 
strength of global Tamil solidarity.
Diaspora professionals have also lent their 
expertise: IT specialists in Europe assist with 
server infrastructure, while trained librarians 
in North America provide guidance on 
metadata standards. One of the Foundation’s 
key technology leaders, L. Natkeeran, operates 
from Canada. As Shaseevan recounted with 
a smile, “We had been working closely with 
Natkeeran for years before we even saw his 
photograph. That’s the level of trust that binds 
us-and allows us to achieve the impossible.”
Back in Sri Lanka, a committed team of local 
staff and volunteers manage Noolaham’s daily 
operations-scanning documents, cataloguing 
Salvaged rare 
manuscripts — 
sorted, restored, 
digitized, and 
returned to 
their rightful 
owners, 
preserving 
fragile 
knowledge 
for future 
generations.

entries, maintaining the archive, and 
overseeing outreach efforts. It is this seamless 
synergy between global contributors and on-
the-ground personnel that has made Noolaham 
not just sustainable, but remarkably scalable.
Impact on Scholarship and Cultural 
Continuity
Over the years, Noolaham has evolved from a 
modest digital initiative into a cornerstone of 
academic research and cultural preservation, 
according to a senior lecturer at the University 
of Jaffna, speaking to Jaffna Monitor. “It has 
transformed how Sri Lankan Tamil history is 
accessed, interpreted, and archived,” he noted.
“For historians, linguists, and social scientists 
studying the Tamil community in Sri Lanka, 
Noolaham offers access to a wealth of primary 
sources that were once nearly impossible to 
locate"
“This level of archival access is rare,” the 
lecturer emphasized. “Students of Tamil 
literature can now access out-of-print novels 
and poetry that even major university 
libraries lack. Scholars researching the civil 
war or diaspora politics can construct entire 
narratives using sources that were previously 
fragmented or forgotten.” With citations to 
Noolaham now appearing in peer-reviewed 
books and academic journals across the globe, 
the platform’s scholarly credibility is firmly 
established.
Noolaham’s influence has also subtly 
permeated Tamil political discourse. During 
a recent online clash between ITAK and 
TNPF, screenshots of decades-old newspaper 
clippings and magazine articles-sourced from 
Noolaham-were exchanged on social media 
to highlight ideological inconsistencies. 
Australian-based writer Theivigan 
Panchalingam captured the irony with dry wit: 
“Noolaham now supplies the weapons for our 
political wars.”
The archive’s breadth makes it equally 
valuable for interdisciplinary research. Its 
holdings extend beyond literary texts to 
include social science monographs, statistical 
records, legal documents, oral histories, 
and manuscripts on indigenous medicine. 
Anthropologists, economists, and legal 
scholars alike have turned to Noolaham as 
a vital resource. Its dedicated Dalit and Up-
Country Archives offer crucial insight into 
historically marginalized communities, while 
curated collections on Muslim heritage, 
women’s movements, and regional folklore 
reflect the archive’s growing commitment to 
inclusivity.
A Digital Triumph Against the Odds
Comparisons may be drawn to global 
initiatives like the Internet Archive or the 
Digital Library of India, but within its 
niche, Noolaham stands out. As of 2025, the 
platform hosts more than 173,000 documents 
encompassing over six million pages-arguably 
the most comprehensive digital archive 
maintained by any minority ethnolinguistic 
community in South Asia.
Built on a foundation of volunteer labor, 
community contributions, and post-war 
resilience, Noolaham has succeeded 
where even well-funded state or academic 
institutions have sometimes faltered. 
“Archiving has traditionally been the 
responsibility of governments,” a longtime 
Noolaham volunteer told Jaffna Monitor. 
“We are doing the work of a government,” he 
explained.
The platform’s success has begun to inspire 
other communities around the world. One 
foreign user-himself a Tamil language learner-

Inside Noolaham’s Scanning Lab
The early documents were typed manually 
in basic .htm formats. “One person would 
read aloud while another typed,” Kopinath 
recalls. “It was slow and painstaking-so 
much so that in our first year, we managed to 
digitize only about a hundred books.” But as 
technology advanced, so did their methods. 
By the end of 2006, scanning technology had 
been introduced, dramatically speeding up the 
digitization process and improving fidelity to 
the original texts.
Today, Noolaham employs three distinct 
scanning techniques, each tailored to the type 
of material being digitized. Flatbed scanners 
are used for rare and fragile books, with pages 
scanned individually. Sheet-fed scanners 
handle more common titles, where pages can 
be gently unbound and scanned in batches. 
But for the most delicate items-such as ola-
leaf manuscripts-a more sensitive approach is 
essential.
“Ola leaves are extremely fragile-you can’t 
feed them into a scanner,” explains Kopinath. 
“To preserve them, we use a specialized 
method involving DSLR cameras and 
controlled lighting. It’s the same process 
followed by the British Library.”
“When scanning books, we follow 
international standards,” he adds. “Some 
people might think it’s enough to snap photos 
with a phone-but that’s not how we operate. 
We aim to meet the same documentation 
standards used by institutions like the British 
Library.”
“Of course, we don’t have their advanced 
equipment,” he acknowledges, “but we ensure 
our methods align as closely as possible with 
theirs,” he told Jaffna Monitor.

praised Noolaham as “a rare example of how 
a people can digitally reconstruct their cultural 
identity when their physical heritage has been 
under assault.” It demonstrates that even in the 
face of violence, displacement, and neglect, 
digital tools can become powerful instruments 
of preservation and resistance.
No Censorship, No Bias: Noolaham’s 
Commitment to Archival Integrity
“Though each of us may have our own 
political leanings, we never censor or show 
bias in what we archive,” said Shaseevan. 
“We document whatever is available-without 
prejudice. If someone were to publish a book 
tomorrow calling Noolaham a den of thieves, 
and they gave us permission to digitize it, we 
would archive that too.”
Kopinath echoed the sentiment, recalling a 
defining moment in Noolaham’s early journey: 
the decision to archive Murinthapanai (The 
Broken Palmyra)-a book that sharply critiqued 
Tamil militant movements. “That was our 
1001st archived item,” he noted. “It was our 
way of saying that this project is committed 
to preserving all perspectives, not just the 
convenient or popular ones.”
The decision was not without controversy. 
“Some of our major donors-who were 
instrumental in Noolaham’s early growth-
questioned us,” he said. “They asked, ‘Why 
would you archive The Broken Palmyra? 
Isn’t it anti-Tamil?’ Our answer was simple: 
Whether it’s anti-Tamil or not is irrelevant. 
It’s a book. It exists. It deserves to be 
documented.”
That principled stance, he explained, gradually 
earned the trust of the broader community. 
“Over time, people came to understand that 
we’re here to document history-not to rewrite 
it. And that understanding brought even more 
support to the initiative.”
Safeguarding the Future: Noolaham’s 
Next Chapter
As Noolaham moves into its third decade, 
the challenges ahead are as real as the 
achievements behind. Scaling digital 
infrastructure, ensuring sustainable funding, 
training new volunteers, and adapting to 
rapidly evolving technologies are all part of 
the road ahead.
“As long as there are Tamil people who 
cherish their heritage, the spark that ignited 
Noolaham will continue to burn bright as an 
eternal flame of knowledge,” one core team 
member told Jaffna Monitor.
When asked what could significantly improve 
Noolaham’s capacity, one of its founders, 
Kopinath, explained: “What we need most is 
land and a permanent building. Right now, 
we’re operating out of rented houses on a 
temporary basis. We’ve been entrusted with 
thousands of rare books and manuscripts, 
but we don’t have a secure space to store and 
preserve them.”
He added, “Our people often donate land to 
temples and religious institutions. If someone 
could offer us just a small plot, we could raise 
the funds ourselves to build the facility we 
need. At the moment, our office is crammed 
with shelves and overflowing cabinets. We 
don’t even have enough space to carry out 
daily work efficiently. A dedicated space 
would change everything-it would unlock new 
possibilities for conservation, training, and 
outreach.”
The appeal is modest. The vision is far-
reaching. The question now is-will our society 
listen?
