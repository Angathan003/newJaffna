Healing in Jaffna: What the 
North Taught a Southern 
Doctor About Empathy

Dr. Shane Halpe
Kondavil: A Masterclass in 
Compassionate Care
When I first stepped into the Family Health 
Center (FHC) in Kondavil, Jaffna, I had no idea 
that this quiet, unassuming facility in Sri Lanka’s 
Northern Province would become one of the 
most formative classrooms of my career. It quickly 
revealed itself as a living model of what a family 
health center should be across the island.
As a family physician from Wattala, 
I arrived with curiosity, humility, 
and not a word of Tamil. But what 
I lacked in language, I made up for 
through observation, empathy, and 
the willingness to listen with both 
my eyes and heart. And in return, 
FHC Kondavil didn’t just welcome 
me—it shaped me. It continues to 
shape not only my career but also my 
deeper understanding of what truly 
compassionate, community-rooted 
healthcare can look like.

The Spirit of Family Medicine
Under the thoughtful mentorship of 
Consultant Family Physician Dr. S. Kumaran, 
I began to see family medicine not just as a 
medical specialty, but as a living, breathing 
philosophy of care. At the Family Health 
Center in Kondavil, medicine transcended 
the conventional boundaries of diagnosis 
and prescription. Each patient encounter 
was rooted in context—care here meant 
understanding not only the illness, but the 
individual behind it. I learned to ask: Where 
does this patient come from? What are 
their daily struggles? How do their social, 
economic, and emotional realities shape their 
health? Dr. Kumaran demonstrated that true 
healing begins when we treat people, not 
just symptoms. It was a revelation—one that 
reshaped how I viewed my role as a physician 
and deepened my sense of responsibility to the 
communities I serve.
The Family Health Center in Kondavil stood 
out as a true hub of integrated, community-
oriented care. It wasn’t merely a place where 
people came to seek treatment—it was a 
proactive health ecosystem. Within its modest 
walls were a range of thoughtfully organized 
services: a dedicated space for counseling that 
offered emotional and psychological support; 
a healthy lifestyle clinic that promoted 
nutrition, exercise, and preventive habits; 
and a responsive outpatient department that 
managed everything from acute conditions 
to long-term follow-ups. What impressed 
me most was the center’s forward-thinking 
approach—it placed equal emphasis on 
prevention, early detection, and patient 
empowerment. Chronic disease screening was 
not an afterthought but a routine priority. Even 
the recordkeeping reflected this ethos: notes 
were handwritten with care, and duplicate 
copies were given to patients. This simple 
gesture not only bridged communication 
gaps but also cultivated a sense of mutual 
accountability and trust between provider 
and patient. It was a subtle reminder that 
healthcare works best when it’s a shared 
journey.
From pregnant women navigating the 
uncertainties of motherhood to elderly 
individuals living in quiet isolation, the Family 
Health Center in Kondavil opened its doors to 
everyone. No one was left behind. The center’s 
local staff, fluent in Tamil and deeply familiar 
with the community’s culture and rhythms, 
ensured that every patient was heard and 
understood without barriers. One of the most 
striking practices I observed was the routine 
home visits—a seemingly simple act, but one 
with transformative power. Visiting a patient 
in their own living space offered a window 
into their world: their support systems, daily 
challenges, and the unspoken truths that don’t 
always emerge within clinic walls. It gave every 
clinical decision a deeper layer of meaning.

What moved me most 
was the truly holistic 
nature of care. Health here 
wasn’t treated in isolation. 
Emotional suffering, 
substance dependency, 
poverty, and domestic 
dynamics—all were 
considered vital parts of the 
clinical picture. Even the 
smallest details—a hesitant 
glance, worn-out clothing, 
or the way someone sat—
were interpreted with 
empathy and care. The 
Family Physician’s intimate 
understanding of the local 
environment allowed for 
care that was not only 
personalized but profoundly 
human.
Reaching the Margins: 
The Rural Clinic in 
Myliddy
My journey through Sri 
Lanka's Northern Province 
then led me to Myliddy, a 
remote village nestled on 
the northern coast. There, 
within the walls of a small 
Primary Medical Care Unit, 
I witnessed medicine in its 
most raw, stripped-down—
yet profoundly impactful—
form.
The facility itself was 
basic: no examination 
bed, minimal privacy. Yet, 
patients—a tide of mostly 
elderly and economically 
vulnerable individuals—
came in droves. Their ailments painted a vivid picture of 
rural life: pervasive musculoskeletal pains, chronic gastritis, 
reproductive issues, and the tell-tale oral lesions from betel 
chewing.
Delivering Care Against the Odds
Despite the glaring limitations—a sparse supply of medications 
and a lean staff—care was delivered with an undeniable 
sincerity that touched me deeply. We focused on empowering 
patients, educating them on crucial aspects of posture, 
nutrition, cancer screening, and essential self-care.
However, the stark reality of inadequate infrastructure hit hard. 
I distinctly remember two cases: one of recurrent miscarriage, 
another of persistent vaginal candidiasis. Providing dignified 
care in such an environment was a painful, constant reminder 
that healthcare equity truly begins with fundamental facilities. 
It highlighted the invisible barriers that often stand between 
patients and the quality care they deserve.

What stayed with me most, however, was the 
unwavering dedication of the young Medical 
Officer in Charge. Tireless and committed, 
she had become the lifeline of that fragile 
clinic. Yet behind her calm efficiency lay a 
silent struggle—managing an overburdened 
facility with minimal support, and facing an 
impossible choice: to pursue her long-delayed 
postgraduate dreams or stay behind, unsure 
of who would carry the torch if she left. Her 
dilemma reflected a larger, systemic crisis. In a 
country where over 4,600 health professionals 
have migrated in recent years, rural outposts 
like Myliddy are being stretched to breaking 
point. Her voice—firm, yet laced with worry—
echoed the urgent need to rethink how we 
support, retain, and uplift those who choose to 
serve in the most underserved corners of our 
healthcare system.
The Quiet Revolution in 
Neurorehabilitation
Another chapter of my Northern journey 
unfolded at Green Memorial Hospital in 
Manipay, where Dr. S. Kumaran introduced 
me to a remarkable neurorehabilitation unit. 
This haven for children with cerebral palsy, 
autism spectrum disorder, genetic syndromes, 
and more was driven by a multidisciplinary 
team—and powered by hope.
The unit offered free, intensive therapy. 
Structured play, self-care training, and 
creative expression were woven into daily 
routines. A sensory garden helped children 
with touch sensitivities. Cultural events and 
dance performances celebrated their progress. 
Parental support, too, was prioritized with 
workshops and one-on-one counseling.
What I witnessed here went beyond 
rehabilitation—it was a quiet resurrection 
of hope, self-worth, and human potential. 
I saw children once thought to be limited 
begin to flourish, their parents rediscovering 
confidence with every small milestone. 
Therapists moved with unwavering patience, 
not merely treating conditions but nurturing 
possibilities. In those moments, I was 
reminded that the true calling of medicine 
is not only to mend the body, but to restore

lives—to help people believe in 
themselves again.
Facing Darkness with 
Light: Mental Health and 
Prison Rehabilitation
At the Family Health Center 
in Kondavil, I witnessed a rare 
but vital integration of mental 
health into primary care. A 
dedicated clinical psychologist 
served patients grappling with 
grief, depression, psychosexual 
concerns, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder—conditions 
often left unspoken in many Sri Lankan 
communities. Through a combination of in-
person counseling, telemedicine consultations, 
and community-based group therapy, the 
center created a safe space for healing the 
mind as well as the body. It was here that I 
came to appreciate mental health not as a 
separate discipline, but as an essential pillar of 
holistic care.
Rehabilitation Behind Bars: A Glimpse 
of Hope in Jaffna Prison
This commitment to emotional well-being 
extended even beyond the clinic walls—to 
places often forgotten in discussions of public 
health. At Jaffna Prison, I encountered a 
profound and often overlooked dimension of 
medicine: healing behind bars. Many of the 
inmates I met were not hardened criminals, 
but individuals caught in cycles of poverty, 
addiction, and unaddressed trauma. There, 
within the stark confines of prison life, they 
were receiving primary medical care, guided 
meditation sessions, and vocational training—
all designed to support rehabilitation rather 
than simply enforce punishment.
Substance abuse rehabilitation was a major 
focus of the prison’s efforts. Drawing from a 
holistic framework, the program combined 
individual and group counseling, skills-
building workshops, and psychosocial support. 
For young men in the Northern Province 
battling addiction, this model offered a second 
chance. The work being done within those 
walls was quietly revolutionary, targeting 
not just the symptoms of substance abuse, 
but the underlying causes—displacement, 
unemployment, familial breakdown—and 
charting a new course for recovery and 
reintegration.
What struck me most was the ethos of 
the entire system: one of restoration, 
not retribution. These were not isolated 
interventions—they were threads in a 
broader tapestry of hope. In a region still 
healing from the scars of war, this was a bold 
and compassionate attempt to break cycles 
of suffering and offer light in places long 
overshadowed by darkness.
A Day of Listening
One quiet morning back in Kondavil, I was 
An outdoor therapeutic neurodevelopmental activity for the differently abled children

asked once more to step in and assist at the 
Family Health Center. My Tamil was still 
hesitant, my vocabulary limited—but I had 
learned to listen with more than just words.
A temple caretaker came in, worn down 
by fever and worry, convinced he needed 
antibiotics. A simple explanation and a 
touch of reassurance were enough to ease 
his mind—a quiet triumph of trust over 
unnecessary medication.
An elderly woman shuffled in with chronic 
knee pain, her body tired but her spirit defiant. 
She had outlived war, loss, and hardship, and 
needed more than analgesics—she needed to 
be seen, to be acknowledged as a reservoir of 
resilience.
Then came a young father, sleepless and 
anxious, troubled not by disease but by a 
habit—spicy late-night snacks that disrupted 
his rest. A gentle dietary intervention brought 
him relief, proving once again that not all 
suffering requires a pill.
A woman, nervous and hopeful, spoke of her 
struggle to conceive. Her burden was heavy—
but so was the silence of her partner. With 
empathy, we reminded her that fertility is a 
shared journey, not a solitary burden.
A restless teenage boy followed, his energy 
misread as a disorder. Suspected of ADHD, 
he was, in fact, a passionate karate student—
bursting with potential and desperate for 
validation.
Finally, a schoolteacher—poised, educated, 
and diabetic—sat unaware of the silent 
damage progressing within her. Her blood 
reports hinted at looming complications, but 
she had never been told what they meant. 
With careful guidance, we began the journey 
of lifestyle change—before medication ever 
became necessary.
Each encounter that day reaffirmed a truth 
I had come to cherish: family medicine is 
not about the drama of emergencies or the 
prestige of complex procedures. It is about 
presence. It is about seeing the whole person, 
not just the illness—choosing conversation 
over prescription, insight over assumption. In 
Kondavil, I learned that healing often begins 
not with action, but with listening—with 
showing up fully, even when words fall short.
The Future We Must Build
Undoubtedly, my time in Northern Sri 
Lanka both challenged and transformed me. 
I witnessed a model of healthcare rooted in 
trust, compassion, and continuity—despite 
glaring gaps in infrastructure and support. 
The spirit of family medicine is alive, but its 
foundation urgently needs strengthening.
If we are to build resilient health systems, 
we must invest in rural clinics, empower 
local staff, expand community outreach, and 
address the growing crisis of professional 
migration.
After three decades of brutal war, the North 
is healing—steadily and with quiet strength. 
But for it to truly thrive, it needs our collective 
commitment. From Kondavil to Myliddy, from 
prison wards to playrooms, family medicine in 
Jaffna is not merely surviving—it is reshaping 
what it means to care. The government 
must also rise to the occasion by supporting 
these unwavering medical professionals and 
prioritizing the development of essential 
healthcare infrastructure.
