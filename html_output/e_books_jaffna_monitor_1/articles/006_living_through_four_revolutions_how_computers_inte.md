F
orty-five years ago, I walked into this 
assembly hall thrice a week for morning 
assembly. My classmates and I always sat 
over on that side. Today, I thought I would 
share with you four technological revolutions 
that happened between then and now. They are 
intertwined with my career. For all of us, this 
is an exciting time to be alive. I think it is not 
an understatement to say that never before in 
human history did people have the opportunity 
to engage with multiple technological 
revolutions within their lifetimes.
In telling the story of these four revolutions, 
I hope to draw your attention to cautionary 
tales. As young people full of hopes and 
dreams, I want you to marvel at the magical 
wonders that technology brings us. But I also 
want you to be aware of potential concerns 
they raise, and why you should equip yourself 
with the knowledge and skills you need to 
navigate the promises and pitfalls of new 
technologies.

The four revolutions are: the computer and 
software revolution, the Internet revolution, 
the mobile phone revolution, and the artificial 
intelligence revolution.
The Computer and Software Revolution
The first, the computer and software 
revolution, was already under way when 
I sat there forty-five years ago. Until the 
1970s computers were expensive and rare. 
They cost hundreds of millions of rupees and 
filled entire rooms. Only select organizations 
like governments and universities and big 
companies in rich countries could afford them. 
By the late 1970s, technology had advanced so 
far that computers could fit on a desktop. They 
were then called “microcomputers”. Many 
companies sprang up, building the hardware 
and software for microcomputers. The first 
Apple computers arrived in 1976. IBM 
introduced a microcomputer in 1981, calling it 
a “personal computer” or “PC” for short. That 
name stuck. A new startup company began 
writing software for microcomputers. That 
was how Microsoft got its name — they wrote 
microcomputer software.
By the late 1970s, ordinary people in western 
countries were able to buy home computers. 
Their kids started to grow up with computers. 
Forty-five years ago, computers were still 
extremely rare in Sri Lanka. But we all knew 
about them. I borrowed a book from the 
library and tried to teach myself to program. 
Without access to a computer, it was a little 
futile. Imagine trying to learn how to drive a 
car or ride a bicycle by reading a book! Trying 
to learn programming without a computer is a 
little like that.
I saw my first computer at the University of 
Peradeniya. When I had to switch to Indian 
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, I was 
sufficiently hooked to want to study computer 
science and engineering.
Fast forward to now, computers are 
everywhere. They run all aspects of our 
lives. You may be carrying several of them 
right now: your watch, your phone, your 
tablet, your laptop; if you came to school 
in a vehicle, it likely had multiple on-board 
computers, even bicycles have them. Learning 
computer science turned out to be a good 
decision.
Internet revolution
The second was the Internet revolution. 
People realized early on that interconnecting 
computers will open up a whole new world 
of possibilities. By 1980, there were already 
different types of networks to interconnect 
computers. The Internet was conceived as a 
network of such networks. By 1990, ordinary 
people could connect their computers to 
the Internet. E-mail and file transfer existed 
already back then. Soon, the World Wide 
Web was invented, providing an easy way 
to navigate the information on the Internet. 
Suddenly there was an explosion of Internet 
activity. Companies big and small are 
connected to the Internet. New startups built 
entirely new businesses on the Internet, like 
Google, which provided an easy and effective 
way to search for information on the World 
Wide Web. Companies like Amazon began 
selling products over the Internet. This was 
known as “electronic commerce.” I went on 
to work at IBM in 1995 to do my doctoral 
research on electronic commerce just as 
Internet access began to be available in Sri 
Lanka.
Today, it is difficult to imagine life without the 
Internet. One cannot really fully participate 
in society if one doesn’t have Internet access. 
Every aspect of human life from work to play 
found its manifestation on the Internet. The 
Internet lets people work remotely, do their 
shopping, watch their favorite sports, listen to 
music, and so on and so forth.

The World in Your Pocket: The Mobile 
Phone Revolution
The third was the mobile phone revolution. 
The idea that a telephone could be a portable 
handheld device dates back to more than a 
century ago. But it became technically feasible 
only in the 1970s and was widely deployed 
only in the 1990s, but just for phone calls and 
text messages.
People realized that mobile phones are little 
computers and can be made to do everything 
a computer could do. That led to the 
smartphone. The first smartphones, like the 
Nokia 9000 Communicator, began to appear 
in the late 1990s.
I went to work for Nokia in its heyday. The 
Nokia motto was “Connecting People”. 
That was exactly what mobile phones made 
possible. You could connect to people you 
care about much more easily than before, at 
any time, from any place. At Nokia, I saw the 
mobile phone revolution unfolding in front 
of my eyes and was fortunate enough to be 
part of work that went on to benefit billions of 
people today, like helping to design Bluetooth 
pairing protocols that allow two Bluetooth

devices to easily and securely establish a 
connection.
Today, mobile phones are universal. For many 
people, they are their first computers and their 
only means of connecting to others over the 
Internet.
The Age of Artificial Intelligence
The fourth and final revolution I want to 
discuss is the artificial intelligence, or AI, 
revolution. We are all living through it right 
now. People have always wondered about 
designing machines that can think and act 
like human beings. The term “AI” dates 
back to the 1950s. AI techniques became 
practical enough in the early 2010s when three 
things aligned: new approaches for training 
AI were developed, computers became 
dramatically more powerful than before, 
and, thanks to the Internet, large amounts of 
all sorts of data had already been collected 
which could now be used to train AI models 
quickly and effectively. By 2011, AI models 
could outperform humans in simple tasks 
like recognizing objects in pictures. Now 
they have become “generative,” capable of 
producing new content. We have generative 
AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney 
and many more. They can generate text or 
images or videos when prompted. You have 
all seen how stunning the results are: they can 
generate text that looks flawless, images that 
look lifelike, and videos that are simply mind-
blowing.
Today, every profession and every aspect 
of human life are being impacted by AI. We 
don’t know how far this revolution will go. 
But we can already see that it will have a 
far greater impact on humanity than all of 
the previous three revolutions combined. AI 
will change the nature of work itself. Your 
careers will not follow the traditional paths 
that your parents and their parents followed, 
that is, starting as a junior and working your 
way up. You need to be nimble and proactive 
to succeed in this new workplace. Those of 
you who learn how to use AI in your own 
profession are more likely to succeed. But AI 
will also bring you new types of opportunities. 
For example, you may have heard of the 
concept of “solopreneurs” — entrepreneurs 
who successfully establish and run companies 
alone, without partners or employees. Being 
a solopreneur is very difficult; it requires 
an incredible breadth and depth of talent, 
dedication, and grit. But AI will allow more 
people of your generation to be solopreneurs.
The Flip Side of Innovation: Fighting 
the Silent Threats
There is no doubt that these revolutions have 
been stunning. They have brought great 
benefits to humanity. But they have also 
brought about new concerns or exacerbated 
existing ones.
The first concern is the potential for security 
breaches. People were excited about the 
possibilities promised by these technologies. 
But they did not at first account for how “bad 
actors” would try to use them. Experts realized 
that they need to make these technologies 
robust against intelligent adversaries who are 
looking for ways to compromise the systems. 
This is the field known as “cybersecurity.”
I have spent the last thirty-odd years doing 
research in cybersecurity, trying to understand 
what makes software, mobile phones, and 
AI vulnerable and how to make them more 
robust.
The second concern is privacy. The Internet 
and mobile phones allowed service providers 
like Google to collect an enormous amount 
of data from the way you interact with their 
services. This data helps them profile you 
precisely. For example, all your Google 
search queries taken together can tell Google

a lot about you: your gender, age, interests, 
financial status, political and religious beliefs 
and so on. They can use it to improve their 
services to you. If you and I search Google 
for the same thing, it can and often does give 
different results based on how their algorithms 
have profiled you and me differently. But the 
data can be misused in ways that people might 
not expect.
Ten years ago, a company called Cambridge 
Analytica used such profiling information 
gleaned from mountains of collected data to 
influence elections in the US and the UK. 
Governments have now realized that they 
need to regulate data collection and use. 
For example, the General Data Protection 
Regulation in Europe has brought in 
stringent requirements on how companies 
can collect data and what they might use it 
for. As you can see, this is no longer a purely 
technological concern. It is a policy question 
that requires expertise in law and policy 
making.
A third and even bigger concern is ethics. 
When I trained as a computer scientist, my 
curriculum did not include philosophy or 
ethics. But the runaway success of information 
technology means that computer scientists are 
now faced with ethical dilemmas increasingly 
often. Taking AI as an example, they grapple 
with questions like: Will AI systems become 
so advanced that they turn against humanity? 
What can we do to align the goals of AI 
systems with ours so that they don’t turn 
against us? How can we prevent misuse of AI, 
such as the creation and dissemination of fake 
news? How do we stop AI companies from 
unfairly using creative works from artists to 
train their AI models?
Facing new revolutions
I chose those four revolutions because they 
were closely intertwined with my own 
career. But several other major revolutions 
also took place during the same period—
genetic engineering, quantum computing, 
nanotechnology… the list is truly mind-
boggling. Your own careers will be shaped 
by new technological revolutions. All of you 
will live through them, and some of you will 
help shape them. These revolutions will enrich 
human lives in countless ways—but they will 
also bring new risks.
To participate in and shape those revolutions, 
humanity needs all kinds of expertise. Not 
just technologists, but also lawyers, teachers, 
journalists, policymakers, poets, and so on. 
Choose your path and learn your trade well. 
But at the same time, equip yourself with 
the knowledge and skills you need, to figure 
out how you are going to face and overcome 
those risks. How do you do that? There is no 
one way. Even as you specialize, learn topics 
outside your specialization. If you want to be 
a scientist or engineer like me, make sure you 
learn some philosophy and ethics, too. If you 
want to be a lawyer, learn some technology. 
Learn not only in classrooms and libraries but 
also from others. Talk to your elders at home. 
Talk to experts whenever you get the chance. 
Talk to your teammates on the sports field. I 
am sure Trinity has already made you realize 
the importance of a well-rounded education. 
Build on that!
All of us are privileged to live during such 
an exciting time. Enjoy the fruits of these 
revolutions and go forth into the world to 
shape new ones so that your children can 
enjoy their rewards.
