NPP’s Garden Lizard 
Lesson in Northern Politics
I
f you're looking for a metaphor 
to sum up the NPP’s misguided 
political saga in the North, look no 
further than the old Tamil saying:  
"Ntypapy; NghFk; Xzhid vLj;J 
Ntl;bapy; tpl;Ll;L Fj;JNj> 
FilANj vd;whdhk;"  (“They 
took the garden lizard headed for 
the fence, tucked it into their veshti, 
and now complain that it’s biting and 
scratching.”)
That, in essence, is the story of 
Naveena Ravanan—real name Pon 
Suthan—a self-styled firebrand Tamil 
nationalist who briefly honeymooned 
with the NPP at a time when the 
party was hell-bent on fielding anyone 
with a pulse for the local government 
elections. He didn’t contest himself, 
but his sister and a few ready-made

loyalists ran under the NPP flag.
In recent weeks, Ravanan has returned to 
the streets of Iyakkachchi, staging dramatic 
protests against the very party he was recently 
feasting with.
It’s worth recalling what we wrote in our last 
editorial: in their desperate bid to secure 
local seats, the NPP flung open its doors to 
opportunists, political crooks, and jokers like 
him. And now, predictably, it’s come back 
to bite them. After the NPP came to power, 
Ravanan repositioned himself as their face 
in Pallai. The once-fiery nationalist—who 
used to shout slogans of ethnic purity and 
hail Prabhakaran as Suriya Devan to keep 
his diaspora funders happy—suddenly began 
quoting Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as if 
he were born waving the red flag. His once-
fringe meetings quickly became headline 
events, attended by no less than Prime 
Minister Harini Amarasuriya and NPP’s 
Northern organiser Bimal Rathnayake, who 
even visited his farm for a meal—an event 
Ravanan triumphantly flaunted on Facebook.
But the romance soured fast. After the 
NPP refused to appoint his sister to a 
representation seat in the local council, 
Ravanan flipped. He launched a crusade—
staging press conferences, leading protests, 
and now portraying himself as the aggrieved 
victim. And so, people are asking the obvious 
question: Why was he welcomed into the NPP 
in the first place?
One can only hope that the NPP’s Northern 
leadership has learned a lesson or two from 
this absurd episode. If not, they’d better keep 
their veshtis tighter next time.

S
ri Lanka's Public Utilities Commission 
(PUCSL) has approved a 15% electricity 
tariff increase, adding fresh financial strain to 
households still recovering from the country’s 
worst economic crisis since independence.
The revision impacts consumers across different 
categories: industrial users face a 14.9% increase, 
government institutions 16%, hotels 15%, 
and general-purpose users 14%. For domestic 
consumers, low-usage households will see an 8% 
increase, medium users (91–180 units) face a 
15% hike, while heavy consumers will bear a 17% 
increase.
The adjustment responds directly to International 
Monetary Fund demands following the Ceylon 
Electricity Board's (CEB) LKR 18.5 billion loss in 
Q1 2025.
The situation highlights a stark governance 
paradox. Under Ranil Wickremesinghe's 
administration, despite widespread corruption 
allegations, the CEB achieved remarkable 
profitability - recording 93 billion rupees in profits 
used to settle debts. The previous government 
implemented harsh but effective tariff increases: 
75% in August 2022, 66% in February 2023, and 
18% in July 2023.
The NPP government, elected on unprecedented 
anti-corruption credentials, has seen the CEB 
return to losses within months of taking office. 
The institution recorded a 3.0 billion rupee loss in 
December 2024, forcing today's tariff reversal that 
undermines their relief promises.
This raises uncomfortable questions about 
governance effectiveness. How could an 
allegedly corrupt government successfully 
manage a complex state enterprise while a 
clean administration struggles with the same 
institution?
