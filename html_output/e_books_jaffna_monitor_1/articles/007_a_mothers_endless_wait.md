# A Mother’s Endless Wait

“Y
ou look better today,” I 
said as I absentmindedly 
began writing her prescription. 
She was one of my regular 
patients-a gentle old lady who 
had been coming to my clinic for 
years.
Her main complaint had always 
been her lack of appetite. Each 
time she mentioned it, I reassured 
her that it was likely due to her 
chronic lung condition. I never 
thought to ask beyond the surface, 
never questioned what lay beneath 
this persistent symptom.
Then, one day, she quietly 
revealed something that shook 
me.
“I haven’t had lunch in 22 years.”

I looked up in disbelief. Had I misheard? 
Twenty-two years without lunch? Guilt crept 
over me. How had I never asked her about her 
meals, her daily routine, or her family? I knew 
she had three daughters. I knew her eldest 
daughter had been widowed at a young age-a 
sorrow that weighed heavily on her. But I had 
never asked about her son.
Hesitantly, I asked, “Why?”
She took a deep breath, her frail hands 
trembling as she reached for the worn purse 
she always carried. Her eyes filled with tears, 
but she did not let them fall.
“I was waiting for my son to come back.”
The words hung heavy in the air.
Her son-her youngest, her only boy-was 
just 19 years old when he left for a tuition 
class one Sunday in the year 2000. He never 
returned.
A friend had seen him being taken into a 
military bus along with a few others. “He will 
come back,” the friend had assured her.
But he never did.
She refused to believe he was gone. She could 
not believe it.
And so, she waited.
Every single day, she cooked his lunch, just as 
she had on that fateful Sunday. But she never 
ate. How could she, when the plate meant for 
him remained untouched?
She searched for him tirelessly. Alone, she 
visited every police station, every army camp, 
pleading for answers. She collected every 
newspaper that printed his name in the lists of 
the disappeared, clinging to each mention as 
proof that he was still out there somewhere, 
waiting to be found.
The International Red Cross sent her a pocket 
calendar every year-a small reminder that they 
had not forgotten. That they would help her. 
That maybe, just maybe, one day, she would 
find him.
She carried with her a collection of torn, faded 
newspaper clippings-each one a fragment of 
hope-tucked safely in her purse, always close 
to her heart.
She attended every protest, every meeting held 
by families of the disappeared. She traveled 
miles whenever there was even the faintest 
whisper of new information. Recently, she had 
been called to a distant district and was given 
a serial number-some kind of record, but not 
the answer she longed for.
She did not allow herself to grieve. To grieve 
would mean accepting that he was gone. And 
she could not do that.
She believed that her son was alive. That he 
would return.
But time was slowly betraying her.
Her body was growing weaker. Her weight 
was dropping, though her hope never 
wavered.
At her last clinic visit, she told me softly, 
“I will see my son before I die.” Then, as if 
sensing my silent doubt, she added, “And if 
I don’t, I have left a letter with the Grama 
Sevaka. My body must not be cremated until 
my son returns to do my last rites.”
I sat in silence, listening, as I always did.
Her frail frame worried me. Each visit, the 
scale confirmed what my eyes could already 
see-her body was fading, even as her hope 
burned bright.

Each time I gently urged her to eat, she 
would smile faintly and say, “Don’t worry, 
doctor. I will not die until I see my son.”
And I knew she was not alone.
There were so many mothers like her. So 
many wives, sisters, and daughters who 
had spent decades waiting, searching, 
clinging to memories-and to hope.
Their stories, their suffering, their quiet 
endurance-slowly fading from the world, 
just like them.
But for those who still waited, hope was 
their lifeline. It was the only thing keeping 
them-and the untouched meals of their lost 
loved ones-alive.
And so, I prayed.
Not just for her son to return.
But for the flame of hope in her heart to 
burn strong until her last breath.
Because as long as she hoped, she lived.
And in her heart, the lunch she made for 
her son 22 years ago remained warm, 
untouched-waiting, just like her.
