hile many people—let 
alone athletes—at the 
age of 66 have long hung 
up their boots, settling into 
retirement and relying on 
medications to ease joint 
pain, Northern Province’s 
sporting stalwart Shan 
Thayalan is rewriting the 
rules of aging. A legendary 
athlete and proud alumnus 
of Jaffna Hindu College, 
Thayalan continues to defy 
expectations with remarkable 
energy and determination. 
Far from slowing down, he 
remains a fierce competitor 
on the international masters 
athletics circuit, proving that 
passion and perseverance 
don’t come with an expiry 
date.
His recent performance at 
the 11th Sri Lanka Masters 
Athletics Championships 
once again reaffirmed 
his status as a living icon 
of Sri Lankan sport. 
Competing in the 65–69 age 
category at last weekend's 
championships, held at 
Colombo’s Sugathadasa Stadium, Shan Thayalan delivered 
a truly remarkable multi-event display. He clinched a gold 
medal in the pole vault with an impressive leap of 2.1 meters, 
demonstrating precision and agility. Not content with a single 
podium finish, he also secured a silver medal in the javelin 
throw, launching the spear a commendable 28.87 meters. 
Rounding out his formidable outing, he placed fourth in the 
discus throw, registering a distance of 24.95 meters.

The championships attracted a robust field 
of seasoned athletes, drawing participants 
not only from across Sri Lanka but also from 
international contingents including India, 
the Maldives, Canada, and several other 
nations. Amidst such diverse and experienced 
competition, his achievements stood out, 
reaffirming his widespread reputation as one 
of Sri Lanka’s most versatile and persistently 
successful sportsmen.
This recent triumph is far from an isolated 
incident. Shan. Thayalan is no stranger to 
breaking records. In the 2024 edition of the 
very same tournament, he shattered the 
existing national record in the pole vault for 
his age category, clearing a remarkable 2.32 
meters – a full two centimeters beyond the 
previous benchmark of 2.3 meters.
From his formative school days, Shan Thayalan 
consistently excelled across a broad spectrum 
of sports, including cricket, football, hockey, 
basketball, and track and field athletics. 
Remarkably, during his youth, he achieved 
the rare distinction of representing the Jaffna 
District in all four major team sports—cricket, 
football, hockey, and basketball—a feat seldom 
matched in Sri Lanka’s extensive sporting 
history.
His versatility transcended the playing field. 
He became a certified umpire in cricket, 
football, hockey, and basketball, and also 
served as a qualified athletics official, 
timekeeper, and starter.
Beyond his personal athletic accomplishments, 
Shan Thayalan made enduring contributions 
to sports administration and education. 
Before retiring, he served with distinction as a 
Deputy Director of Physical Education. In this 
influential capacity, he mentored generations 
of young athletes and played a pivotal role 
in shaping and institutionalizing sports 
development across the Northern Province. 
His legacy is one of tireless dedication, both on 
and off the field, to the elevation of Sri Lankan 
sport.
