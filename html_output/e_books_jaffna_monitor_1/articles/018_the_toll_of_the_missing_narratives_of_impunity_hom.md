eople becoming unaccounted for as 
a direct result of, or in connection 
with armed conflicts and other situations 
of violence is unfortunately, a common 
phenomenon throughout the world. The 
continuous emotional struggle endured 
by families of missing persons is an 
incomparable suffering.

to address the issue of 
missing persons should 
be found as a matter 
of urgency as it would 
otherwise present a 
serious obstacle to any 
inclusive and long-term 
process of reconciliation”. 
Adopting all feasible 
measures to account for 
persons reported missing 
as a result of armed 
conflict, and providing 
their family members 
with all available 
information thereon, is a 
legal obligation imposed 
on states by International 
Humanitarian Law (IHL). 
Families of missing 
persons constitute a 
sub-group of victims of 
armed conflict, and as 
a general rule, some of 
their needs are shared by 
some or all other victims. 
Nonetheless, families 
of missing persons face 
a specific reality of having to wait for an answer about the fate 
of their missing relative(s), and in light of that develop specific 
needs. Therefore, it is essential to assess the needs of missing 
persons’ families before embarking upon any action in their or 
their missing relatives’ favour.

In accordance with the Cabinet decision dated 14th March 2022, the OMP has managed to 
conduct a total of 6,449 inquiries. The inquiries led to the following outcomes:
The needs expressed by the families of the 
Missing can be broadly categorised as:• The 
need to know the fate and whereabouts of 
the missing person, as well as circumstantial 
information related to his/her disappearance 
• Emotional needs • Economic needs • Legal 
and administrative needs• Needs relating to 
acknowledgement and justice.
The families of missing persons often want 
acknowledgement of: • the missing person’s 
dignity and intrinsic value; • the fact that the 
disappearance took place; • the perpetrators’ 
responsibility; and• the steps that need 
to be taken to address the occurrence of 
disappearances.
The Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, 
Administration and Discharge of Functions) 
Act No. 14 of 2016 (OMP Act) was enacted 
in August 2016. On 28 February, 2018, His 
Excellency the then President, Maithripala 
Sirisena, on the recommendations of the 
Constitutional Council board members as 
the Commissioners established the Office of 
Missing Persons (OMP). 
The OMP has categorized its data of 14, 988 
cases into three major phases, prioritizing the 
incidents of the missing persons that have 
occurred more recently.
The first phase: cases between 2000-2021l; 
Second phase: cases between 1981-1999; Third 
phase: cases occurred before 1980
The Act outlines the functions of the Office 
(OMP Act, Section 13): To search for and 
trace missing persons and to clarify the 
circumstances; To make recommendations 
to the relevant authorities to ensure non-
recurrence; To protect the rights and interests 
of missing persons and their relatives and To 
identify proper avenues of redress; to collate 
data from existing sources and centralize all 
available information in a database.

Symbolic measures to be initiated 
immediately • A National Day to remember 
all the victims of the conflict should 
be declared. • The government should 
issue a public apology in recognition of 
past violence and initiate political and 
constitutional reform to resolve the conflict. 
• Commence discussions across Sri Lanka 
on what should be part of a memorialization 
initiative, with space provided to remember 
and acknowledge the violence of the past.

The need to address the effects include:
1) 	 Psychosocial issues of the members of 
the family, consequent to the loss of the 
family member, 
2) 	 Post traumatic condition of the relatives 
of Missing Persons, 
3) 	 The next–of–kin’s belief that their loved 
one/ones are still living and being held in 
custody, 
4) 	 Inability to exercise the legal rights of 
the missing persons in their absence and 
absence of a death certificate, 
5) 	 Reluctance of relatives to obtain 
Death Certificates/Temporary Death 
Certificates due to the fact that the 
missing person/persons will come back 
home one day and due to misinformation 
given by NGOs and some people for 
monetary gains,  
6) 	 Abuse of the rights of Women and 
Children, 
7) 	 The existence of a large number of 
widows due to missing of their husbands, 
who were the bread winners in the family, 
on–availability of a permanent source of 
income/meaningful livelihood for them, 
9) 	 Difficulties in continuing educational 
needs of the children, 
10) The presence of disabled person/persons 
in the family and difficulties in feeding 
them and fulfil their day to day needs 
including medical treatments and related 
facilities. Some of them are either elder 
brother or sister or both who were the 
bread winners in the family, 
11) The huge responsibility of women in 
Women‐Headed Households towards 
maintaining the family by fulfilling their 
day to day needs. This has become a 
serious issue to the women who have no 
proper income and no relatives to help 
them, 
12) Drug Abuse, increasing trend of 
consumption of liquor and related 
crimes, 
13) Culture related issues, 
14) Loss of self–esteem and dignity,   
Understanding Suffering. 
People who have undergone terrible ordeals 
have the unshakable convictions that 
Only someone who has endured the same 
experience can properly understand others 
and when the extent of their suffering has 
been fully grasped enables them to share it  
uninhibitedly.  This attitude helps people to 
form bonds of solidarity, which in turn may 
alleviate their suffering and help them to 
eventually social ties. 
Ending Psycho Social Isolation 
When affected persons share their 
experiences with others, family members 
come to  realize that they are not the only 
ones carrying such a burden.  They can talk 
freely  about personal experiences and more 
importantly mention their missing relatives  
without fear or burdening others. Being able 
to express their distress of their relatives’  
absence can have a significant impact on their 
ability to cope.

Story
Cry, Thaṇigāsalam, cry. Don’t stand silently 
like a tree. Your own wife, that saint who bent 
her head to receive your thāli in a promise to 
share in your joys and sorrows till death do you 
part, now lies here as a corpse.
But you stand there staring at a distance. Is 
your heart made of stone! Or have you petrified 
into a statue?
You human worm, cry; you ought to cry.
Translated from the original Tamil 
short story kadaicik kaiṅkariyam 
(filrpf; ifq;fupak;) from the 
1964 collection of short stories 
titled akkā (mf;fh)

Tears, flood forth! Stream out of his deadened 
eyes!
He must indeed cry.
Thaṇigāsalam sits leaning against the eastern 
pillar, like a piece of dead wood. His left hand 
bent to support his chin. With eyes reddened 
like kōvaippaḻam, and hair disheveled, he 
looks spent.
Who wouldn’t? Who could sit up with pride 
after having lost one’s wife?
There on the bed, they have laid out Kamalā, 
nay the corpse, like a bag of skin and bones.
A clean white sheet is draped over her. 
Sandalwood paste in her eyes! Dried thirunīṟu 
on her forehead; vermillion on top of it; they 
have taken care to do all the ritual decorations 
worthy of a high-status corpse without leaving 
anything amiss.
Someone had even tied her feet together with 
a jute rope, Criminals!
A lamp by the headboard of her bed flickers 
as though it would go out at any instant, 
illustrating the impermanence of life.
She is unaware of all these ‘festivities.’
She is a corpse!
“aṇṇai, where is the room key?”
Thaṇigāsalam raised his unkempt head to lift 
his gaze up to the top of the opposing pillar.
The key was safely ensconced there.
“dī… Kamalā! When you left that key there, 
did you realize that you would never pick it up 
again?
What patient imagines death? Everyone 
believes that they will get better.
Sāmpasivam stopped by. “What is this 
Thaṇigāsalam, you sit here crestfallen. This 
isn’t a sudden shock, is it; she has been 
bedridden for days … … … “
“What can we do; When we took her to 
hospital, she appeared to be stable… … mmm 
… … this is the nature of tuberculosis.”
Who said tuberculosis is the cause of death? 
Who would know the real reason why she 
died?
He looked at Kamalā; He looked at the 
humongous satinwood box that lay next to her 
with its mouth gaping open.
It was silently inviting her, “Come, come.”
Her cracked lips. Once they were red like 
kōvaippaḻam.
A housefly flew in from somewhere and 
perched itself on her lower lip. A second one 
followed suit.
Her slender fingers did not attempt to gently 
shoo them away as usual. Nor did her eyes 
well up, saying “would you come here and 
fan me? Why do you not pay attention to me 
now?”
She remained dead.
How illness changed her! Earlier, he couldn’t 
even go near her. He could never tell when her 
temper would flare up. “Kill me, I will die,” 
she would scream.
Perhaps all that screaming probably led to half 
of her life energy storming out of her body.
Why was she plagued with doubt, why was 
she quick to anger, even as she was emaciated, 
and her body was without strength? From 
brushing her teeth at dawn, till giving her 
medicines at bedtime and gently massaging 
her legs, he took care of her. His respite was

only when he was at work.
Nevertheless, she could not stand the sight of 
him.
Why? Why?
That day, Thaṇigāsalam was buried in never-
ending work at the office. Not just that day, 
but for a month, the new manager at work 
cursed the old manager, and turned all the old 
files upside down in the name of streamlining.
Until his lady Muriel intervenes to say, 
“darling it’s too late,” he would not leave 
the office. How would he know about 
Thaṇigāsalam’s darling wife and the rare 
illness that plagued her?
When Thaṇigāsalam stepped into the house, 
his wife was the devil incarnation herself.
“Why so late?”
They were ordinary words. But the tone in 
which she uttered them was enough to shake 
heaven, earth, and the netherworld!
Thaṇigāsalam felt as if someone had slammed 
his heart with an iron rod.
“You don’t have to tell me anything. I know. 
The whole town's laughing at your dalliances. 
I am indeed on my way to death…. you and 
that Mary … …”
“Kamalā!”
“Why are you shushing me… … I will ask… 
… that is exactly how I will ask.”
She screamed like the devil.
Thaṇigāsalam did know what he would do if 
he succumbed to his anger. But he restrained 
himself. He touched her shoulder gently and 
tried his best to console her saying “Kamalā, 
don’t shout, Kamalā! This screaming has 
devastated your body. How many times did 
the doctor tell you so? Lie down, my darling 
Kamalā.”
But her suspicion was never quelled.
She was convinced that Thaṇigāsalam had 
betrayed her and was now trying to pull the 
wool over her eyes.
Was she wrong to suspect him? She certainly 
had a shrewd understanding of the male 
psyche.
adi Kamalā, you were not wrong at all. You 
were completely right. I betrayed you. I 
betrayed you wholesale!
The paṟai drum thundered “dum dum dum”. 
He felt as though someone was pounding his 
heart with a sledgehammer. He wanted to drag 
those paṟai drummers out by their collars.
He could not come to terms with the fact that 
his house is now a funeral house.
Did Kamalā really die? Will she never open 
her eyes again?
What if there was a sudden miracle and she 
could raise herself up again?
“Indeed māmi, for how long could the 
husband suffer? He was torn between taking 
care of his job and the household … he was 
driven witless… at least her passing will 
relieve him of this stress… …”
“Still, she had good karma. Not everyone is 
fortunate enough to die wearing a thāli.”
“Was it just a month or two? A whole year 
– who knows what hardships she had to 
endure.”
“Did you not know?”, then in a hushed voice 
“It seems their horoscopes did not match at 
all.”

“That is the bane of love marriages … ..”
Thaṇigāsalam felt the anger surge within him. 
He wanted to tear that dirty mouth to pieces.
Thaṇigāsalam was startled when a lone voice 
started to lament, “did you leave me, my 
precious queen.”
It was Rāsam from the house across the street.
If only Kamalā were alive now … …
* * *
He had taken the day off that day. 
Thaṇigāsalam was at home. Kamalā’s health 
had improved somewhat. He had given her the 
morning medicines, put her to bed in the living 
room, and was pacing in the outer veranda.
Suddenly his instincts telegraphed him. He 
turned abruptly and was shaken by what he 
saw.
She stood holding on to the window bars, her 
hair undone, looking like terror personified.

“Why are you grinning at her?” she demanded 
angrily. He turned back around. Only then did 
he notice.
In the veranda of the house across the street, 
Rāsam sat combing her wet hair, oblivious to 
her surroundings.
She refused to believe Thaṇigāsalam despite 
his earnest and heartfelt proclamations of 
innocence.
Within a month of her becoming bedridden, 
she drove away the woman who was the 
household help. Calling her a “woman” 
borders on hyperbole.
She was a withered old grandmother.
`Kamalā how did the devil of doubt enter your 
heart? Do I look like a scoundrel? Do I look so 
degenerate?’
You did not make a mistake Kamalā. You 
were completely right. I am a sinner! A sinner 
unworthy of forgiveness! I realized it today. 
You realized it long ago.
You are smart, very smart.’
The funeral bustle got going. The menfolk 
spread out a piece of cloth under the tamarind 
tree and started playing cards.
Those who knew how to play the game, or 
those who didn’t get a spot in the game, 
circled around those playing, and were 
offering free advice from time to time.
Some of the older folks secreted a couple of 
cigars for later use, and started smoking one 
while complaining “what an awful cigar is 
this? If one were to smoke, one must smoke 
the VK cigars… … how bitter”. Some others 
were proffering their chins to the barber for 
shaves.
Yet others sneaked around to the side yard, 
and returned smacking their lips, unsteady as 
their feet refused to move.
On the women’s side, the tray with betel 
leaves and old gossip kept their jaws in 
perpetual motion.
A stunning funerary palanquin was taking 
shape by the main entrance. Māṇikkam, the 
dead woman’s father, was supervising the 
preparations. What other opportunity would he 
get to dazzle the village?
The funeral lamentation was reaching a 
crescendo. Ensemble and solo performances 
alternated.
Some women weaved in the petty village 
squabbles into their lament songs. Others 
thought of their own dear departed ancestors 
as a shortcut to summon tears on demand. 
Those with a constitutional inability to 
produce tears simply stopped worrying about 
it. Their stance was that it was enough to reel 
off the words of the lament fluently.
No one paid any attention to Thaṇigāsalam. 
He was the only one who truly appreciated the 
loss of his wife.
Who else would know the unfairness of her 
meeting her demise helplessly.
* * *
When Kamalā was admitted to the hospital, he 
dreaded wondering how he was going to cope. 
But the events in the hospital unfolded in a 
way that he did not at all expect. She stopped 
snapping at him and grew silent. Perhaps she 
had descended into a deep inner trance.
When the nurses stopped by her bed, he made 
himself scarce. He was deathly afraid of the 
possibility that she would say something 
inopportune. But she did not succumb to her 
usual doubts and suspicions about him. For 
some reason she observed a fierce silence.

Kamalā… … adi Kamalā… … why did 
you change that rare trait of yours? Did you 
suddenly develop total trust in my behavior?
Did you even trust me?
* * *
When the new nurse showed up for night 
duty, Thaṇigāsalam felt a pang. She smiled 
needlessly. She spoke up for no reason.
You fool Thaṇigāsalam, did you sense what 
was going on even then?
When the doctor came to examine Kamalā, he 
said they needed to be vigilant until midnight 
that day.
At midnight, they would inject the precious 
medicine that was obtained from Germany. 
Once that was administered, she was likely to 
survive.

Hope flowered within Thaṇigāsalam’s mind. 
Night; Thaṇigāsalam was restless.
The nurse was nowhere to be seen.
Thaṇigāsalam went inside in search of her.
She was standing there. She laughed, “Did you 
think that I forgot? Put this vial in your pocket. 
I will go fetch the syringe and cotton wool.”
Whatever she said, her gay laughter, like the 
needle in her hand, killed him.
“Sister, what do you say, will she survive?
He stood there looking piteously as if the 
tears in his eyes would breach their dam 
imminently.
He yearned to be hugged and consoled like a 
baby.
It was clear that he thirsted for consolation.
“You are a man. If you are shaken even for 
this… when I see you, my heart is shaken, 
too…. Look … look here –”
As she said these words, her hands clasped his.
What did he say; What did she ask?
He became a cobra swaying under a magic 
spell.
The flood of time breached its bounds and 
rushed forth timelessly.
He first saw that dome lamp at a great 
distance, covered so that the bright light didn’t 
blind one.
His sixth sense must have alerted him to 
something. He bolted without looking back, 
but his heart kept pounding.
What he was afraid of had come to pass; she 
lay in an untidy heap. Half in bed, and half 
outside, she hung there helplessly.
Her slender long hands lay there abandoned.
* * *
Does he have the right to conduct her funeral 
rites?
One or two people who were keen to send 
Kamalā to the cemetery on time were busy 
bustling around assisting the Hindu priest 
overseeing the rites.
“Where is Thaṇigāsalam?”
He did not budge.
“eda thambi, Thaṇigāsalam, pour a couple of 
buckets of water over your head and come; the 
priest is waiting.”
Perhaps at least the outer appearance ought to 
be holy.
He stood rooted to the spot.
“Get up, thambi, the corpse is going to stink.”
Thaṇigāsalam felt like knocking his teeth off.
Corpse? Stink?
He felt like sobbing.
“Remove your shirt, Thaṇigāsalam.”
He shifted a little and removed his shirt in 
disgust.
Something fell at his feet and shattered.
It was nothing but that medicine vial that the 
nurse had given him. That famous German 
medicine that had the power to arrest a 
departing soul and prevent it from leaving the 
body.
He became petrified again.
