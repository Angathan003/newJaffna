Dear Readers,
The Jaffna Monitor, your trusted English language magazine, has received overwhelm-
ing support since its November launch. Thanks to our local readers and the Sri Lan-
kan Tamil diaspora, we are further inspired in our mission to provide a platform for 
Jaffna's diverse voices, showcasing our culture, challenges, and achievements impar-
tially.
The December edition of Jaffna Monitor features esteemed writers like Appadurai 
Muttulingam, translated by Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ, alongside an insightful article by Writer 
Sathiri. We are also excited to welcome Dr. Aravinthan Arunthavanathan, a renowned 
cricket writer. Our goal remains steadfast: to offer impartial journalism that sparks 
dialogue and understanding, free from political influences.
In this issue, we delve into a poignant chapter of our history with the cover story "The 
Muslim Expulsion by the LTTE from Northern Sri Lanka." This reflective piece is 
not just a recount of past events but a step towards acknowledging and rectifying the 
mistakes of our past as Tamils. It's a move towards healing and understanding within 
our community.
Our team, driven by a shared passion for journalism and a commitment to our com-
munity, is excited to announce upcoming initiatives to support educational develop-
ment and critical thinking in Jaffna's youth. We plan to distribute our magazine for 
free to local schools and libraries and provide additional support through a dedicated 
website. This initiative, born from our own experiences with limited English resources 
during our Tamil-medium education, is essential for the next generation.
We also recognize the importance of nurturing a mindset that embraces diverse and 
critical thinking. Encouraging young minds to question and analyze is not just an edu-
cational goal but a societal necessity. It's a vision we only fully appreciated later in life 
and one we're now dedicated to instilling in Jaffna's youth.
To bring these projects to fruition, we are seeking the support of sponsors and adver-
tisers. Your involvement is more than just financial assistance; it's an investment in 
shaping a generation that is enlightened, inquisitive, and capable of critical thought.
As we move forward, our commitment to illuminating the untold stories of Jaffna and 
building a well-informed, engaged reader community remains unwavering. Your con-
tinued support is invaluable, and we invite you to join us on this evolving journey.
Thank you for being part of the Jaffna Monitor's story.
With sincere thanks,
Editorial Team

T
he Tamil National Alliance (TNA) faces a critical juncture as M.A. 
Sumanthiran, a prominent Member of Parliament, urges Rajavarothiam 
Sampanthan, the once-admired leader of the TNA, now encumbered 
by health constraints, to retire from his parliamentary duties. This 
recommendation is noteworthy, given that Sumanthiran is not only a key 
figure within the alliance but also a known protégé of Sampanthan, often seen 
as his loyal supporter.
Sumanthiran's call for the 90-year-old leader to step down reflects the gravity 
of the current situation. Sampanthan, facing numerous health and physical 
challenges, has struggled with limited mobility, inconsistent attendance in 
Parliament, and diminishing sensory capacities. These concerns highlight 
the need for a transition to ensure adequate representation for the Tamil 
community.
Trincomalee, the district represented by Sampanthan, is a melting pot of 
Tamil, Sinhalese, and Muslim communities, contrasting with predominantly 
Tamil regions like Jaffna. This diverse demographic makes the role of a 
dynamic Tamil representative even more crucial, especially in light of ongoing 
land encroachments and tensions from Buddhist Sinhalese fundamentalist 
groups. Sampanthan's limited participation in key meetings and fieldwork 
has led to a perceived vacuum in advocacy and oversight, prompting calls for 
more vigorous representation.
