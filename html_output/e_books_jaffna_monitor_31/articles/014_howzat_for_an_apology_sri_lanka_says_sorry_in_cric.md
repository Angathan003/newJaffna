T
he Sri Lankan government has officially apologized 
to Jay Shah, President of the Asian Cricket Council 
(ACC) and Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket 
in India (BCCI), following comments made by former 
Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga. Ranatunga 
blamed Shah for the decline of Sri Lankan cricket, but 
Ministers Harin Fernando and Kanchana Wijesekara, 
speaking in Parliament, asserted that Sri Lanka's own 
administrators are to blame, not external figures.
Meanwhile, there's concern over the International 
Cricket Council (ICC) ban on Sri Lankan cricket. 
Tourism Minister Harin Fernando highlighted that this 
ban could jeopardize the upcoming under-19 cricket 
world cup in Sri Lanka. Essentially, no cricket, no money!
Additionally, a Ministerial Sub-Committee, led by 
Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, has been set up to negotiate 
with the ICC about the ban. The committee's job is 
to examine the crisis and suggest changes. Minister 
Wijesekara emphasized that the ban affects all levels 
of Sri Lankan cricket, from the national teams to the 
juniors.
To cap it off, earlier this month, the ICC suspended Sri 
Lanka Cricketâ€™s membership, citing severe breaches, 
including government interference in cricket affairs. The 
drama unfolds as the country's sports minister, Roshan 
Ranasinghe, is also involved in the spat. It's like a cricket 
soap opera but with more apologies and committee 
meetings!

Sri Lanka Says Sorry in 
Cricket Blame Game
MONITOR MEMO
S
ri Lanka's Opposition Leader, MP Sajith Premadasa, 
has called on President Ranil Wickremesinghe to 
decisively act against those implicated in the country's 
economic crisis, following a Supreme Court ruling that 
held former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, ex-Finance 
Minister Mahinda and Basil Rajapaksa, and former 
Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivad Cabraal responsible 
for the turmoil.
In a parliamentary address, Premadasa suggested a 
course of action similar to a historical incident under 
J.R. Jayewardene's rule when Srimavo Bandaranaike's 
civic rights were revoked. This precedent, under which 
both Premadasa's father and President Wickremesinghe 
served, is now proposed to be applied against the 
Rajapaksa brothers through the formation of a Special 
Presidential Commission.
However, this proposal by Premadasa is viewed as 
impractical and potentially counterproductive. President 
Wickremesinghe's lack of a solid parliamentary majority, 
combined with perceptions of his connections to the 
Rajapaksa clan, makes such a drastic measure unlikely. 
Additionally, critics argue that this suggestion, while 
dramatic, might lack relevance and could unintentionally 
rehabilitate the Rajapaksas' image during the economic 
crisis.
Notably, the historical precedent set by J.R. Jayewardene, 
often considered a grave injustice to Srimavo 
Bandaranaike, actually resulted in her gaining public 
sympathy. This outcome could serve as a cautionary tale, 
suggesting that similar actions against the Rajapaksa 
brothers might evoke public sympathy for them, 
potentially aiding their political recovery.

Plan Against Rajapaksas
