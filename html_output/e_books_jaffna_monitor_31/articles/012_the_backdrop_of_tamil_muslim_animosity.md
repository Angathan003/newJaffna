fter the Indian Peace Keeping Force withdrew in March 1990, 
hostilities reignited between the Sri Lankan Army and the LTTE 
by June of that year. Concurrently, the conflict's intensification fueled 
growing tensions between the Tamil and Muslim communities in 
the Eastern regions. A number of Muslim members of the LTTE 
defected, choosing to align themselves with rival factions, including 
the Sri Lankan military and other insurgent groups. These defections 
provoked the ire of the LTTE's regional military commander in the 
East, Karuna, and the political leader, Karikalan. Under Karunaâ€™s 
command, a crackdown ensued within the LTTE ranks, leading to the 
execution of several Muslim members on the grounds of suspected 
betrayal. By the end of that year, the LTTE had all but eradicated its 
Muslim components, with the death toll of those purged rumored to 
be between 500 and 600.

Simultaneously, actions by the ruling United National 
Party (UNP) government exacerbated these tensions. A 
number of Muslims with questionable reputations were 
recruited into the Government Home Guard, aligning 
with security forces to incite violence against the Tamil 
population. There were instances where the Muslim Home 
Guards orchestrated mass violence against Tamil civilians, 
including the obliteration of Tamil villages and settlements, 
often with the clandestine backing of the security forces.
In a brutal cycle of retribution, the LTTE committed its 
own atrocities against Muslim civilians. Notably tragic were 
the instances of LTTE-perpetrated massacres, such as those 
of Muslims during prayers in mosques at Sammanthurai 
and Kattankudy, and the targeted killing of civilians in the 
Eravur village, named after Saddam Hussein. These events 
marked some of the darkest episodes of communal violence 
during the conflict.
While tensions between Tamils and Muslims escalated in 
the eastern region, the dynamics in the North contrasted 
sharply, with Tamils and Muslims, especially those from 
Jaffna, coexisting peacefully. The cordial relations between 
Jaffna Muslims and their Tamil neighbors presented a stark 
juxtaposition to the strife in the East. This paradoxical 
situation was a source of frustration for the eastern LTTE 
leaders, particularly for Karuna and Karikalan.
With Karikalan at the helm, a delegation from the eastern 
command made their way to the North, determined to 
persuade the LTTE's supreme leader, Prabhakaran, of 
the imperative to take firm action against the Muslim 
population as a whole, aiming to set a precedent. Karikalan, 
intent on delivering a stark message, laid out the rationale 
to Prabhakaran, who was swayed by the argument and 
agreed to the necessity for sweeping actions, signaling a 
stern warning to Muslims in both the northern and eastern 
regions.
Karikalan not only advocated for the expulsion but 
also took charge of orchestrating the seizure of Muslim 
properties and belongings. Under his oversight, the 
confiscation was ruthless and systematic, ensuring that the 
evicted Muslims were left with little more than 150 rupees 
and a pair of clothes. This calculated move to strip the 
Muslims of their possessions was emblematic of the severity 
with which the LTTE enforced its authority and the cruel 
precision of its campaign against the Muslims.
