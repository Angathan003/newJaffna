he recent incident at the University of Jaffna, 
where human rights lawyer Swasthika Arulingam 
was barred from delivering a lecture under threats 
from pro-LTTE student groups, shines a harsh light 
on the deeply rooted issue of intolerance towards 
criticism and dissent in Sri Lanka. This event is not 
just a reflection of university politics but a symptom 
of a broader, more troubling pattern of suppressing 
democratic rights and freedoms across the nation.
Historically, Sri Lanka has seen a consistent pattern 
of suppression of dissent, whether by political 
parties, rebel groups like the LTTE and JVP, or 
various presidential regimes. These entities have 
often responded to criticism not with dialogue and 
tolerance but with authoritarian tactics, using their 
power to silence opposition. The LTTE, known for its 
fascist tendencies similar to the JVP under Rohana 
Wijeweera, and various Sri Lankan presidents, 
including Gotabaya Rajapaksa, are prime examples 
of this. The downfall of the LTTE and the resignation 
of Rajapaksa can be partly attributed to their inability 
to accept and engage with criticism, highlighting the 
detrimental effects of such intolerance.
The silencing of voices like Swasthika Arulingam's is 
an affront not only to individual rights but also to the 
foundations of democratic discourse. It contradicts 
the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (UDHR), to which Sri Lanka is 
a signatory, particularly the fundamental right to 
freedom of expression. Ironically, the groups and 
individuals who often champion democracy are the 
ones engaging in these suppressive acts.
This issue extends beyond student groups and 
individual universities, signaling a more pervasive 
problem that affects Sri Lanka's seats of higher 
learning and its government. The tendency of the 
educated youth, expected to be the harbingers of 
change and progress, to suppress dissenting voices 
raises critical questions about the direction in which 
Sri Lankan society is headed.
The incumbent government also bears responsibility 
for this troubling trend. By either turning a blind 
eye or actively engaging in such suppression, it sets a 
dangerous precedent and tacitly endorses these anti-
democratic practices.
This moment should serve as a wake-up call for 
all stakeholders â€“ the government, educational 
institutions, civil society, and the citizenry. There 
is an urgent need to recommit to the principles of 
democratic discourse, creating an environment 
where diverse voices are not just tolerated but actively 
encouraged, and dissent is seen as crucial to a healthy 
democracy.
Sri Lanka's journey towards true freedom and 
democracy is fraught with challenges, but it is a 
journey that must be undertaken with unwavering 
commitment. For the future of the nation, it is 
essential to start this journey now, fostering a culture 
that values critical analysis and embraces diverse 
ideologies and viewpoints. Only through such a 
commitment can Sri Lanka hope to build a more 
inclusive, resilient, and progressive society.
