Gowripal Sri aka Sathiri
A Journey from Reverence 
to Regret
Gowripal Sri, formerly known as Sathiri in the 
LTTE ranks, is a writer based in France. With 
18 years spent in the LTTE, his transition from 
militancy to writing has allowed him to share 
a deep, reflective account of his experiences. 
His stories, conveyed to ‘Jaffna Monitor’ 
editor Kaniyan Pungundran, shed light on 
the personal and collective journeys of those 
involved in the struggle for Tamil Eelam.
actions. My life’s path was irrevocably altered by the events 
of 1983, setting me on a course of armed struggle for the 
liberation of my people.
I was far from alone in my resolve. Many of my peers, 
driven by a shared dream of a sovereign nation for the Sri 
Lankan Tamil people, rallied to the call of various Tamil 
militant groups. Among my close friends, the divide in our 
paths was marked by the different groups we joined; one 
enlisted with the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization 
(TELO), another with the People’s Liberation Organisation 
of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). At one point, the landscape 
of our struggle was a mosaic of some 30 to 35 different 
militant groups, each with its own methods and strategies, 
but all were woven together by a single, unifying thread: 
the dream of establishing a separate country for the Sri 
Lankan Tamils. All of my immediate friends were aligning 
with one faction or another, each of us bound by the same 
vision of freedom and self-determination. As for me, I 
found my place with the LTTE. For us, the leader of the 
LTTE, Prabhakaran, was an inspiration, though he had yet 
to attain the demigod status he would later achieve within 
the organization.
Over the years, approximately 50,000 LTTE cadres gave 
their lives, believing that Prabhakaran’s war tactics would 
lead to the establishment of Tamil Eelam. However, our 
dreams were shattered, mainly due to Prabhakaran’s 
OPINION
I 
spent over 18 years of my life with the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a journey that began 
in the shadow of a harrowing ordeal that my people, 
the Sri Lankan Tamils, endured in 1983. The violence was 
meticulously orchestrated by the Sri Lankan government at 
the time, led by President J. R. Jayewardene of the United 
National Party (UNP). I still vividly recall the horror as 
thousands of Tamils were mercilessly slaughtered, and 
hundreds of Tamil women were subjected to unspeakable 
acts by Sinhalese mobs. It was clear that these atrocities had 
the tacit approval of the Jayewardene government, which 
seemed intent on teaching a brutal lesson to the Tamil 
community. This pogrom was a direct retaliation for the 
Four Four Bravo ambush by the LTTE at Tirunelveli.
Haunted by the images of destruction and the cries of my 
people, I felt an overwhelming urge to seek retribution and 
justice. It was this passion that propelled me to join the 
ranks of the LTTE as a fighter. The memory of the violence 
acted as a catalyst, igniting a fierce resolve within me to 
hold the Sinhala government accountable for its heinous 
LTTE Chief Prabhakaran pictured with his deputies, 
Kittu and Mathaya.

stubbornness and his mistakes that ultimately led to the 
demise of the LTTE. In the final stages of the war, the 
LTTE, under Prabhakaran’s leadership, lost sight of its 
initial goals and turned its guns against the very Tamil 
civilians it had vowed to protect.
Reflecting on the tumultuous journey of our struggle, it’s 
evident that the most critical and divisive actions were 
made by Prabhakaran. He was the architect behind the 
ban and the ensuing execution of thousands of militants 
from competing factions, the forceful eviction and robbery 
of the Muslim community from their ancestral homes in 
the north and east, and the grievous assaults on innocent 
Sinhala and Muslim civilians. Even the assassination of 
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was a directive from 
Prabhakaran. These decisions, originating from the top 
echelons of the LTTE and executed by its cadres, severely 
marred our image on the world stage. Tragically, it was the 
young, often innocent cadres of the LTTE who bore the 
brunt of these actions, sacrificing their lives for the cause 
under the shadow of their leader’s fateful choices.
As a former member of the LTTE who dedicated many 
years to the cause, I take a measure of comfort in 
acknowledging that Prabhakaran, once venerated as our 
unyielding leader, stood firm in his convictions to the very 
end. As confirmed in Kamal Gunaratne’s book ‘Road to 
Nandikadal,’ Prabhakaran fought valiantly until the last 
bullet was fired, until his final comrade fell. I am confident 
of his demise, which was as steadfast as his life; he lost 
everything in pursuit of his belief, including the lives of his 
family and his young son, Balachandran. This unwavering 
commitment, regardless of the mistakes and the dark 
turns his leadership took, provides a strange comfort. It 
offers thousands of us, former LTTE cadres, a sense of 
closure and a moral compass, enabling us to come to terms 
with our past and to find our way back to a semblance of 
everyday life.
The assertions by specific political figures and self-serving 
entities that Prabhakaran is still alive are a source of 
profound grief for us. We know these claims to be false. 
The very thought that he could be covertly alive after the 
demise of 50,000 innocent young lives under his command 
is inconceivable. If, against all odds, he were to be found 
alive, my plea to my former leader would be stark: it would 
be better for him to embrace death, for in life, he has 
already caused immeasurable loss and suffering.

n a display of cricketing prowess and strategic acumen, Aus-
tralia secured their record-extending sixth World Cup victory, 
outmaneuvering India in a high-stakes final in Ahmedabad. 
This triumph wasn't just about sheer skill; it was a testament to 
Australia's cricketing philosophy, a blend of aggressive batting, 
clinical bowling, and fielding that borders on the artistic.
The hero of the hour, Travis Head, played a pivotal role in set-
ting up this monumental victory with a masterfully paced 137 
off 120 balls. Yet, it was his extraordinary fielding effort earlier 
in the day that truly turned the tide. His stunning catch to dis-
miss India's captain, Rohit Sharma, was more than just a display 
of athletic prowess; it was a strategic masterstroke that shifted 
the momentum firmly in Australia's favor.
India's total of 241, a figure that could have been far more 
daunting, was held in check by Australia's disciplined bowling 
and agile fielding. The early dismissal of Sharma, who was just 
beginning to unleash his destructive batting, proved crucial in 
restraining a team known for its explosive scoring potential.
