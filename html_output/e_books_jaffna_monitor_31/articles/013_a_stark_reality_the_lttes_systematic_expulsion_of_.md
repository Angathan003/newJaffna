n a disquieting echo of history, the 
expulsion of Muslims from Sri Lanka's 
Northern Province by the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) starkly 
aligns with the international legal 
definition of ethnic cleansing, a grievous 
violation of human rights. This act, devoid 
of the brutality of mass killings yet replete 
with the pernicious intent of demographic 
alteration, mirrors chilling parallels in 
global history.
Ethnic cleansing, as delineated in 
international law, signifies the intentional 
displacement of a particular ethnic 
or religious group through force or 
intimidation. The objective? To forge a 
homogenous region, purged of perceived 
ethnic incongruities. The LTTE's 
systematic eviction of Tamil-speaking 
Muslims from their ancestral homes in Sri 
Lanka is a textbook case. Their lives and 
livelihoods were upended, not through 
random acts of violence, but through a 
calculated campaign of forced migration.

The international community, led by the United Nations, 
has long condemned such acts. UN General Assembly 
Resolution 47/121, crafted in the backdrop of the 
Yugoslav conflict, offers a stark condemnation of ethnic 
cleansing. It categorizes these actions as flagrant violations 
of international humanitarian and human rights law, 
demanding not just cessation but reversal.
Looking through the lens of history, the expulsion of ethnic 
Germans after World War II from Eastern Europe, although 
not marked by widespread slaughter, was a clear case of 
forced demographic alteration. Similarly, the expulsion of 
the Lhotshampas from Bhutan in the 1990s, though less 
violent than other ethnic conflicts, was no less destructive in 
its impact on human lives and cultural continuity.
The Bosnian War of the 1990s further exemplifies 
ethnic cleansing with its deliberate creation of ethnically 
homogenous territories. Closer in time, the Rohingya 
crisis in Myanmar showcases the same heinous pattern: 
a minority group persecuted and forced to flee through a 
combination of violence and intimidation.
The LTTE's actions in Sri Lanka, viewed against these 
historical precedents, reveal a disturbing trend. While 
the method may vary — from violent expulsions to more 
coercive, systematic displacements — the end goal remains 
the same: to alter the ethnic and cultural tapestry of a region 
for political or ideological ends.
This comparison is not just an academic exercise. It serves 
as a crucial reminder of the continuing relevance and 
urgency of international human rights law. The plight of the 
Muslims in Northern Sri Lanka, much like the 
plight of displaced populations worldwide, 
underscores the necessity of global vigilance 
and intervention in cases of ethnic cleansing.
The expulsion of Muslims from Northern Sri 
Lanka by the LTTE stands as a stark example 
of a global pattern of ethnic cleansing. These 
actions, which clash profoundly with the 
principles of human rights and dignity, 
highlight the critical need for a consistent and 
robust international response to prevent and 
redress such grave violations. History has time 
and again demonstrated that the consequences 
of inaction extend far beyond the immediate 
suffering of victims, leaving a profound and 
enduring mark on the collective conscience of 
the world.
A
ddressing Parliament, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran made 
a seemingly outlandish yet serious claim: the Rajapaksa 
family's wealth is vast enough to compensate every Sri Lankan 
for the nation's economic crisis. While this might sound 
like a joke to outsiders, those familiar with the Rajapaksa 
clan's alleged massive wealth understand the gravity of his 
statement. Backing the Supreme Court's decision against 
ex-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, along with former Finance 
Ministers Mahinda Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa and others 
for economic mismanagement, Sumanthiran urged the 
repatriation of their overseas assets for national economic 
recovery and citizen compensation.

D
uring the Dutch colonial period, in 1734 A.D., 
the present-day Nallur Kandaswamy Temple 
was constructed by 'Don Juan' Ragunatha Maapaana 
Mudaliyar. He was not only a prominent figure in the 
Jaffna society but also served as a Shroff in the Jaffna 
Katchery. He chose for the temple's location a site 
known as 'Kurukkal Valavu,' distinct from its original 
setting. During that period, Kurukkal Valavu was a 
settlement primarily inhabited by Muslims, and it 
also housed a significant Sufi shrine.
According to historical accounts, including the 
Yalpana Vaipava Malai written by the Tamil 
poet Mayil Vaakaanar, the present-day Nallur 
Kandaswamy Temple was established in the midst 
of a Muslim settlement. It is said to contain a sacred 
Sufi tomb of a revered Sufi saint named Sikandar, 
who was held in high esteem by both Hindus and 
Muslims.
Initial reports indicate that the Muslims living in 
Kurukkal Valavu were hesitant to abandon their 
locale. In reaction, some Saiva Tamils engaged in 
targeted acts of hostility to compel them to leave. 
This included the slaughtering of a pig and the 
desecration of the community wells with its meat, 
which were essential for the Muslim residents’ daily 
use. Faced with such acts, the Muslims of Kurukkal 
Valavu ultimately decided to move, finding a new 
settlement closer to the Jaffna town in regions like 
Oddumadam and Sonakar Theru.
Anyway, Muslim families who lived in the Kurukkal 
Valavu enjoyed a special relationship with the temple 
authorities who, recognizing the community’s 
historical connection to the land also the sin of

chasing the innocent Muslims from the Kurukkal Valavu, 
granted them the exclusive rights to sell camphor, an item 
used in Hindu rituals.
The temple's expansion over the years was inclusive, 
enveloping the Sufi shrine within its precincts. As 
the temple expanded its boundaries, the tomb was 
encompassed within its precincts, but the temple officials 
didn't forget its significance. They kept a lamp perpetually 
burning as a gesture of their sustained respect for the 
Muslim sentiments linked to the shrine.
However, this harmony was disrupted in 1990 when the 
LTTE, in their quest for an ethnically singular Tamil state, 
ousted the Muslim community from Jaffna. This forceful 
relocation cut Muslims off from their deep-rooted heritage, 
including their historical ties to the Nallur Temple.
In the post-war years, as Muslims began returning 
to Jaffna, the physical and spiritual landscape they 
encountered had altered. The practices surrounding the 
Sufi tomb had dwindled. While the historical memory of 
the shrine lingers, the present-day religious observances 
of the Muslim community have largely moved away from 
Sufi traditions. The tomb itself has been obscured, walled 
off from the public eye, a silent witness to a once-shared 
reverence that transcended religious divides.
The "Nallur phenomenon," reflective of a bygone era of 
Hindu-Muslim unity around the historical Sufi tomb, 
is gradually being forgotten. The returning Muslims, 
whose forebears shared a symbiotic relationship with the 
Hindu population through the Nallur Temple, are now 
experiencing a cultural shift. With a growing orientation 
towards Wahhabi principles, which starkly oppose the 
worship at Sufi shrines and tombs, these returning Muslims 
are moving away from the syncretic customs that once 
characterized the region's religious practices.
Moreover, there's an active movement within parts of the 
Jaffna Saiva community to efface the historical footprint 
of Muslims in the Nallur Temple narrative. Attempts to 
rewrite history are underway, with some even denying 
the very existence of the Sufi shrine, striving to remove 
the legacy of a time when mutual reverence transcended 
religious boundaries.

O
ur village is not so renowned that it warrants spreading out a map 
of Sri Lanka, looking f or Jaffna on its head, and marking a big cross 
with a red pencil, boasting, “This is Kokuvil.”
But it is also not so unremarkable that one wouldn’t spread out a map and 
draw a line on it to declare this is Kokuvil.
One must say that like the half-male, half-female artanārisvara form of 
Lord Siva, Kokuvil has its own unique culture without swaying to this side 
or the other.
For some, the name Kokuvil conjures up memories of the kōda-coated 
shiny K.S. brand country cigars. For some, it could bring up the scent of 
meticulously prepared spicy moonshine arrack. For those unfortunate 
enough to have been acquainted with neither, it could be the vicarious 
pleasure of reminiscing about some of those notorious murder cases.
But if anyone who had ever visited Kokuvil says that it is known for only 
one of those things above, one must wonder if they were totally vision 
impaired.
Kokuvil is famous for its lanes. How many different kinds of lanes? Cart 
tracks, sand roads, limestone paths, stone roads, corner lanes, tiny lanes, 
footpaths, foot-and-a-half paths, and on and on.

These lanes are known for dust. Not only that, but they 
can also sometimes deceive even those who were born and 
brought up in those very lanes. If you were distracted even 
momentarily, they had the extraordinary ability to take you 
back where you started from!
One should have in-depth practice to be able to ride a 
bicycle along these lanes. If someone started from KKS 
road that bifurcates Kokuvil, travels along the set of lanes 
that look like intertwined tobacco leaf stems and manages 
to surface on Palaly road at the other end, we can daresay 
that his stroke of luck was so large that he should have 
bought a lottery ticket that day.
In such a village, where fashion trends go up and down like 
the temperature chart of a feverish patient, recent fashion 
imports from Colombo quickly become very trendy. The 
general women’s fashion trend has grown so far that at four 
in the evening, Kokuvil women change from their sarees 
into dressing gowns and loiter around by the front gate 
but scamper indoors as soon as they spot a youngster on 
a bicycle turning the corner by the front gate of Whitefoot 
Kandaiya’s house.
Men who violate government-imposed curfews to sit on 
culverts chit chatting had so much bravery and courage 
that they disappear into thin air when the headlights of a 
military jeep half a mile away flicker into sight.
Children! One doesn’t need to talk about them!
Children born in generous numbers, in complete disregard 
to family planning, infested the lanes.
When there is a 6-month-old in a mother’s arms, the next 
in line will already be in the mother’s tummy, imploring 
to be admitted into the world. The gullies by the railroad 
tracks are the children’s playground.
Their early childhood play ends with lining up soda bottle 
lids along the tracks and looking on from their hiding 
places when the express train speeds past.
***
Readers who are new to Kokuvil may wonder where 
Kokuvil begins.
As the 6:20 am Colombo train departs Jaffna station and 
passes the cemetery, those in the train wouldn’t have failed 
to notice the hundreds of cloth turbans floating behind 
the tall palmyra trees, having given the slip to the health 
inspectors.
Without a doubt, that is where Kokuvil begins.
Although the leading cottage industry in Kokuvil is cigar 
manufacture, if you want to count the number of those who 
got rich by making cigars, you don’t need hands.
Education is in the same state.
The pinnacle of everyone’s hope is a “clerical” job. If, by 
chance, someone got through secondary school, it meant 
that the deity in the Nallur temple, Lord Kandasamy, is 
going to get a special pūja.
If men are like this, there is no need to talk about the state 
of women.
Their educational attainments are such that they could 
compose a telegram message in English with at least four 
mistakes such that it will not reach the recipient.
Whatever said and done, those who value trendiness never 
acknowledged Kokuvil’s fame.

The old woman Sinnaachi looked like a sexagenarian and 
a half! But her physique, toned from watering a thousand 
tobacco plants, was still intact. Her profession was village 
gossip, with a side hustle on collecting jak leaves for her 
goats. She had no shortage of all the stereotypical attributes 
of old women: nagging, stinginess, whining about hardship, 
etc.
If you ignore the “Beware of coaches” warning sign and 
go past the railway crossing and turn left at the junction, 
there is a signboard announcing, “Harmonium repair here,” 
putting the language itself in need of repair.
Opposite to that sign is a narrow lane.

Even at the height of noon, one’s heart will pound if one 
were to walk alone along that lane, greeted only by the cacti 
and thorn shrubs that had grown right in the middle of the 
footpath, unaccustomed to foot traffic.
If we muster up our courage and go further, we will 
encounter a giant cactus adorned with umal bags woven 
from palmyra leaves, bearing witness to the recent increase 
in Kokuvil’s livestock.
Those blessed with handkerchiefs can provide some respite 
to their noses and venture further to see the ‘hallowed 
spot’ where Attaḷai Murukesar was murdered. If you glance 
east from that vantage point, you can see the old woman’s 
dilapidated cottage.
But you cannot really get there directly anymore. Because 
the village court had to intervene in a dispute between 
the mother and the child over a tamarind tree and put up 
a temporary fence, you must turn around, swallow the 
inconvenience and walk along Pillaiyar Kovil Lane that the 
old woman routinely takes.
An old poster put up by someone during the election 
campaign season was still loyally hanging on to the old 
woman’s gate.
The gate was held in place with a rock tied to a taut rope. 
If you let go of the gate, it will shut itself with a bang. The 
surprising thing is that neither the old woman nor the gate 
was aware of the fact that such a mechanism has the fancy 
English term “automatic shutter!”
The rickety old gate doesn’t easily inspire confidence. 
Therefore, let us crawl through the poṭṭu in the fence like 
the old woman does.
Some palmyra sprouts were drying on a winnowing basket. 
Next to it, a ripe chilli on a stick was keeping the crows 
at bay. A little further, there was a tethered goat by the 
entrance. A bundle of grass and a hoe handle lay next to it.
Neither the goat nor the hoe seemed to pay attention to the 
grass.
There was a raised veranda porch wide enough to dry half a 
sack of paddy. On the mud wall next to it, in the tiny space 
not already covered by charcoal scribbles, an old picture 
calendar without dates was hanging pitifully. Judging from 
the attire that Lord Murugan’s consort, Theivanai, was 
sporting in the picture, it must date back to the time when 
puffed sleeves were in fashion in women’s blouses.
The old woman was cleaning prawns in the backyard. A 
sad-looking twentyish young man stood next to her.
“My goodness! How could you? Your mother’s heart must 
be burning up.”
“What can I do Aachchi? I have to pay up for a job in 
Colombo. I tried my best to explain to her, but it was all in 
vain. What else can I do? As soon as I get my first salary, I 
will redeem the jewelry. Don’t forsake me! The police have 
been to my house to search.”
“What! Did you come here after reporting the missing 
jewelry to the police! I don’t need this hassle. If the police 
come to question me tomorrow, I would be at a loss to 
explain …”
The young man knew the ways of the world.
“Aachchi, why are you unnecessarily scared? Could I not 
have pawned this in the big pawnshop in town? I thought if 
I pawned to a neighbor like you, you too would get a five or 
ten percent cut.”
The mention of a five or ten per cent cut’ had the intended 
effect.
The old woman took the washed prawns inside. The stray 
dog that frequently visits the old woman came out of 
nowhere to thwart the crow that had been patiently waiting 
and helped the old woman out by licking the sickle clean.
Wiping her hands on her saree’s border, she held out her 
hand. “Let’s see.”
It was quite heavy. With the years of experience behind it, 
the old woman’s hand told her it was worth at least four 
hundred.
“It doesn’t look like it will measure up to even two and a 
half sovereigns. How much are you asking?”
“Maybe three hundred …”

“Who is going to lend money now? Sellachchi had to 
spend a lot for her eldest daughter’s childbirth. Sinnamonai 
is bedridden… “the old woman continued to mumble 
inaudibly.
She tightened her saree around the waist, pulled out a 
sitting mat from the roof truss and laid it on the porch. “Sit 
here, makaṉ! I will be back in five minutes … the cursed 
cow might wander in … watch out for it”. She took the 
kuththusi, the leaf-collecting spear, and left mumbling to 
herself.
“That scoundrel! He has stolen from his own mother. I 
don’t know how he is going to reform himself. The whole 
world has gone to the dogs … Kanakam’s eldest son is a 
type .. but she deserves it … she is so vain that she is the 
only one in Kokuvil with a gemstone gold necklace … 
when she came by for Muththachchi’s funeral, she didn’t 
even join me in the lamentations!”
By the time the old woman returned after doing her 
rounds, the young man was almost exhausted. He had 
been breaking off all the splinters from the roof truss and 
absentmindedly cleaning his teeth with them.
Oblivious to his state of mind, the large red ants trooping 
away on their way occasionally bit him.
A woman carrying a bundle of grass passed by, looking 
back suspiciously at him.
She comes by often.
He was thoroughly embarrassed to be sitting on the porch 
while wearing pants.
At around noon, the old woman returned cursing someone 
or the other, listing all the maladies that they and their 
descendants for seven generations will succumb to.
The kuththusi was full of jak leaves.
She sat down leisurely and started feeding the leaves to the 
goat.
The young man waited patiently. It didn’t look as if the old 
woman was going to talk! He felt like he was sitting on fire.
“What happened, Aachchi?”
“What can I do? All the cursed women are whining about 
their poverty… did you know.. the granddaughter of 
Kandaiya… the newly rich woman… showed the true 
colors of her caste … like a cat that climbed up the areca 
palm…?”
He ran out of patience. “Ok, I am leaving, give that back to 
me!”
“Why are you getting upset so quickly? Is she the only rich 
woman in Kokuvil? Has everyone else perished? Here… 
this is what I managed to get … no one else has anything to 
give now!”
“How much did you get?”
“Count it yourself. She gave me twenty seven, the cursed 
woman! I took two. The remaining two hundred and fifty 
are there. Make sure to redeem your pawn by the end of 
the month”.
“Monster,” the young man mumbled as he put the money 
in his pocket and began to leave.
* * *
The season changed. Western monsoon gave way to the 
Southern monsoon.
There was no sign of the young man returning from 
Colombo.
The old woman had anticipated just that.
Was she so crazy as to pawn such a valuable piece of 
jewellery with someone else? She had, in fact, lent him 
the money herself, money that she had saved so diligently, 
often going without everything but just the bare necessities.

If the young man had ever returned, her plan was to bluster 
her way out.
That day, the old woman’s eldest daughter dropped by.
“Aachchi, I am going to have a grand puberty ceremony 
for my daughter, inviting everyone. Will you borrow four 
hundred from someone for me? I will return right after the 
ceremony.”
“What on earth is this! Who will give you money at the 
drop of a hat? Besides, will anyone lend you money for 
free?”
“What are you saying Aachchi! All my money is tied up in 
loans I have given to the village folk. My girl’s ceremony 
will net me at least five or six hundred rupees… what do 
I need your money for, I will return it to you with a five 
percent interest.”
“All right, go home! I will go look around here,” the old 
woman said, pointing to the east.
Pakkiyam is the old woman’s daughter, after all. If the old 
woman is pointing to the east, it means she is going to 
finagle something from the west.
Pakkiyam got up to leave, guessing, “could it be Senior’s 
Sellachchi?”
* * *
The sun was scorching. But the old woman’s instincts 
hinted at impending rain showers.
She hurriedly gathered the drying firewood and stacked 
them under the eaves.
Picking up the kuththusi, she left, feeling the pouch in her 
saree around the waist.
She had never before enjoyed the excitement of lending 
money to her own daughter.

Sellachchi will instantly pony up four hundred when she 
sees the gold necklace.
Something bothered the old woman at the back of her 
mind. She opened the pouch and inspected the item. 
Something was not quite right.
She held the necklace to the light and peered.
Her stomach churned!
The world was spinning around her. She slumped down in 
the middle of the path.
The necklace in her trembling hand grinned at her.
Bronze, after all, is bronze.
Somewhere, a rooster flapped its wings noisily.
There was no lightning, no thunder. Outsized raindrops 
started dropping down here and there and splattered.
One couldn’t tell where the dry tears of the old woman fell.
The characteristic scent of Kokuvil dust wafted in the air.
