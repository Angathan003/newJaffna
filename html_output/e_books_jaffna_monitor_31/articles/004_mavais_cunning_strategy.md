Unkept Commitments: 
Sampanthan and the National 
List Seat
Insiders report that Sampanthan, back in 2020, 
had announced to his party's central committee 
and the district offices in his constituency that he 
would not contest in the 2020 general elections. 
Yet, upon insistence from his colleagues, he agreed 
to run on two conditions: one, that he would serve 
only for a year before resigning to allow a younger 
party member to take over, and two, that a specific 
individual from Trincomalee would be given the 
national list nomination, contingent on the party's 
vote share. To this day, these terms still need to be 
met. The TNA secured a single national list MP seat, 
which went to a member from Ampara instead of 
Trincomalee. Moreover, Sampanthan has yet to adhere 
to his initial commitment of stepping down after a 
year for a younger successor.
Mavai's Cunning Strategy
Insider accounts reveal that Sampanthan was 
initially reluctant to contest in the last general 
election, recognizing the limitations brought on by 
his advanced age and health concerns. He had even 
taken steps to pave the way for a successor, nominally 
endorsing Kugathasan as the next parliamentary 
representative for Trincomalee and passing on the 
reins of the party branch to him. However, internal 
party deliberations around candidate selection brought 
complications. Mavai Senathiraja, the Leader of the 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, insisted on Sampanthan’s 
participation as a direct candidate. Mavai’s stance 
was influenced by concerns over his own electoral 
prospects; he feared that if Sampanthan set a precedent 
by stepping down due to age, he might face similar 
pressures to withdraw from his contest in Jaffna.
Furthermore, should Sampanthan opt out of a direct 
competition yet secure a seat through the national 
list, it would jeopardize Mavai's chances of obtaining 
a national list MP seat. Driven by these political 
calculations, Mavai was convinced that encouraging 
Sampanthan to run was indispensable for his own 
re-election bid. Consequently, despite Sampanthan’s 
initial disinclination to vie for the seat, he was 
propelled to stand as the primary candidate in the 
Trincomalee district.
Residents and local members of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi in Trincomalee have expressed a strong desire 
for change. This sentiment was echoed in a significant 
meeting of the party last year, where a faction demanded 
Sampanthan's resignation. Although a committee led 
by Mavai Senathirajah was formed to address this issue, 
Sampanthan's subsequent refusal to resign, citing his 
election despite known physical limitations, temporarily 
quelled the debate.
However, dissatisfaction persists among constituents who 
feel their needs need to be actively addressed. Sumanthiran, 
typically reticent about Sampanthan’s capacity to fulfil his 
duties, recently broke his silence. During a televised debate, 
the host raised concerns about the resources allocated 
to a parliamentarian unable to regularly attend sessions, 
hinting at potential misuse. Sampanthan's response to these 
comments further fueled the controversy.
Following Sumanthiran's public stance, internal party 
critics rallied around Sampanthan, painting Sumanthiran 
as disloyal. It's notable that Sumanthiran, initially 
reluctant to enter politics, did so at Sampanthan's behest 
and is widely regarded as his mentee. Despite this, there 
has been no significant backlash against Sumanthiran 
from Trincomalee's residents or the local party branch, 
suggesting alignment with his views.
Had Sumanthiran supported Sampanthan's continuation 
in office, especially given Trincomalee's sensitive socio-
political environment, it could have been seen as neglecting 
the urgent need for active representation. Such a stance 
might have led to criticism of both leaders, potentially 
framing them as indifferent to the constituents' needs.
This unfolding scenario within the TNA, marked by 
Sumanthiran's challenge to Sampanthan's tenure, represents 
not only a pivotal moment in Sri Lankan Tamil politics but 
also a test of leadership and responsiveness to the evolving 
needs of a diverse and complex constituency.
Sampanthan's Personal Plea 
Postpones TNA-Modi Meeting
In December 2021, the Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi's government arranged a meeting 
with the parliamentarians of the TNA. Sampanthan, 
citing personal reasons, requested the Indian 
government to delay this meeting. Since then, almost 
two years have passed, and the rescheduled meeting 
has yet to take place, leading to speculation about the 
missed opportunities that the original meeting could 
have potentially offered for the Tamil community.
