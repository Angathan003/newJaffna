t's been a few weeks since the vi-
brant chants and the fluttering flag 
of Percy Abeysekera, known endear-
ingly as 'Uncle Percy', were stilled by 
the passage of time. At the age of 87, 
the most ardent cheerleader of Sri 
Lankan cricket left behind a silence 
that resonates deeply within the hearts 
of cricket enthusiasts across the nation 
and beyond.
His enthusiasm spanned over seven 
decades. Born in Boossa in 1936, 
Percy's love for cricket began with 
witnessing the legendary Don Brad-
man play in 1948. He officially started 
cheerleading in 1979, becoming a 
celebrated icon in Sri Lankan cricket, 
known for his ever-flying Lion flag 
and infectious enthusiasm.
Percy's passion led to remarkable mo-
ments in cricket history. He danced 
with Sir Garfield Sobers onboard a 
plane in 1983 and heroically saved So-
bers from a mob during the 1983 riots. 
He showed unwavering support for 
Sri Lanka cricket, even facing death 
threats, and was recognized by Martin 
Crowe, who presented him with two 
Man of the Match trophies. Percy's 
dedication extended to an incident in 
Australia, where he was briefly ar-
rested for entering the field, leading 
international cricketers to intervene 
on his behalf.
Uncle Percy's legacy goes beyond Sri 
Lanka, touching hearts worldwide. 
His absence leaves a void, but his spirit 
continues to inspire cricket fans glob-
ally.

S
ri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is 
not just walking a diplomatic tightrope but also 
performing some daring stunts along the way. On 
one hand, he's playing the role of a careful mediator, 
skillfully accommodating the Chinese research vessel 
Shi Yan-6 in Colombo, and on the other, he's not shying 
away from boldly criticizing America and the West over 
their stance on Gaza.
Wickremesinghe's strategy seems akin to a juggler at 
a carnival, trying to keep several balls in the air - from 
maintaining cordial ties with China to cautiously 
navigating the complex waters of India's concerns. 
But then, in a surprising twist, he turns into a trapeze 
artist, swinging out with sharp critiques of the West's 
approach to human rights issues in Gaza, breaking away 
from the script of a cautious diplomat.
His move to allow the Shi Yan-6's docking, seemingly 
a nod to China, is paired with his outspoken 
comments on the West's perceived double standards in 
international affairs. This combination of diplomatic 
prudence and candid criticism is like hosting a dinner 
party where, amidst ensuring everyone's wine glasses 
are full, he casually drops a conversation bombshell that 
leaves the guests wide-eyed.
In this high-stakes international circus, 
Wickremesinghe appears to be carefully avoiding 
confrontations while not hesitating to voice his opinions 
on controversial matters. It's a humorous yet intricate 
dance of diplomacy and outspokenness, showcasing his 
attempt to balance Sri Lanka's foreign relations with a 
flair for the dramatic.
