T
he saga of Rajavarothiam 
Sampanthan's clinging to his 
position within the Illankai Tamil 
Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) despite 
severe health impediments, 
including significant hearing loss, 
highlights a disturbing pattern 
of opportunism in Sri Lankan 
politics. This pattern is not just 
evident in Sampanthan's insistence 
on holding his chair but also in 
M.A. Sumanthiran's prolonged 
silence and recent vocal opposition, 
raising questions about the genuine 
motivations of both leaders.
Insider accounts reveal 
Sampanthan's initial reluctance to 
contest the last general election, 
swayed by Mavai Senathiraja's 
insistence, driven by his own 
political calculations. This 
manoeuvring, combined with 
Sampanthan's extended use of 
state-provided housing and vehicles 
beyond his tenure as Opposition 
Leader and his unfulfilled 
commitments regarding the 
national list seat, paints a picture of 
deep-rooted political self-interest.
Further, Sampanthan's personal 
request delayed a crucial meeting 
with Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi, and his failure to 
maintain unity within the TNA, 
leading to fragmentation and 
the formation of the Democratic 
TNA (dTNA), reflects his faltering 
leadership. This is compounded by 
the comedic outcome of the TNA's 
internal voting in the secret ballot 
for president, revealing a lack of 
coherence and solidarity within the 
party.
Moreover, Sampanthan's tenure 
as Leader of the Opposition is 
marred by allegations of failing 
to assertively represent Tamil 
interests, particularly in negotiating 
with the Yahapalana coalition. 
His controversial decision-
making, such as nominating C.V. 
Wigneswaran for Chief Minister, 
despite significant resistance, 
further questions his judgment.
All these incidents collectively 
expose a worrisome level of 
opportunism, not only in 
Sampanthan's approach but also 
among other political figures within 
the ITAK and TNA, revealing 
a concerning disregard for the 
genuine needs and aspirations of 
the Tamil community in Sri Lanka.
Power, Politics, and Personal 
Gain: Opportunism within ITAK
I
n the midst of Sri Lanka's 
economic turmoil, a new fiasco 
has emerged within its Health 
Ministry. Officials revealed to 
a Public Accounts Committee 
sub-committee that Rs 31.08 
million spent on fingerprint 
attendance machines in 2017 is 
now essentially wasted. These 
machines, intended to improve 
efficiency and reduce corruption, 
are gathering dust because health 
workers refuse to use them.
The Health Ministry, under 
scrutiny for alleged waste and 
mismanagement, is facing 
questions from the sub-
committee led by Maj. Pradeep 
Undugoda (SLPP). Despite 
a government directive, 213 
machines remain unused, a 
point of contention in the recent 
committee meeting.
Additionally, the committee 
uncovered another blunder: a 
supplier to Angoda Hospital, 
contracted by the health 
ministry, still needs to return 
overpayments, citing bankruptcy, 
yet continues to work for the 
ministry. This situation reveals a 
need for due diligence in contract 
management, further highlighting 
inefficiencies and possible 
corruption within the ministry 
during Sri Lanka's critical 
economic crisis.
