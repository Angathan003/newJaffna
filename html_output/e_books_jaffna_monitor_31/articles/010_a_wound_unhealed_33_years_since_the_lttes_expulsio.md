A Wound Unhealed: 33 Years Since 
the LTTE's Expulsion of Muslims
R
eflecting on my upbringing in Jaffna during 
the late 1980s, my understanding of our com-
munity underwent a profound transformation 
during a visit to Colombo in 2002. It was at the 
'Peace Bridge' event amidst a fleeting pause in the 
conflict, where I first meaningfully interacted with 
the Muslim community. Meeting a fellow student 
who shared his early years in Jaffna disrupted my 
previously held belief that Jaffna was solely Tamil.
This encounter sparked a deeper curiosity about 
the diverse tapestry of Jaffna's past. A poignant 
symbol of this was found in the annals of the 
Jaffna Hindu College's sports record book. Amid 
its pages, the name 'Zabarullah' stood out, a re-
cord holder in the 100, 200, and 400-meter races 
from the 1970s. This intriguing discovery raised 
questions about the heritage and contributions of 
Muslims in Jaffna's prestigious institutions.

My journey then led me to the stark reality of a refugee 
camp in Puttalam, Sri Lanka, where I met Abdul Rahim. 
His story, a testament to the rich, multicultural fabric of 
Jaffna, painted a vivid picture of a life that once was. Born 
in 1965, Abdul Rahim's childhood was one of cultural har-
mony. His Muslim identity seamlessly intertwined with the 
Hindu traditions around him, from celebrating Deepavali 
to participating in the Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil Festival. 
The communal spirit extended to religious observances 
as well, with Hindu neighbours drawn to his home by the 
tantalizing aromas of Ramadan feasts.
This harmony extended to the political aspirations of the 
time. Abdul Rahim's family, along with a significant seg-
ment of Jaffna's Muslim community, fervently supported 
the vision of Tamil Eelam. This commitment was not just 
ideological but deeply personal. His elder brother, Mu-
hammad Sabir, was an active member of the LTTE cadre, 
dedicating his life to the pursuit of this shared dream. 
However, this shared dream was brutally upended in Oc-
tober 1990 when the LTTE, in a drastic and tragic turn of 
events, turned against the Muslim community in Jaffna. The 
ultimatum issued was not only to leave their homes within 
two hours but also to leave behind a lifetime of memories 
and possessions. In this forced exodus, the community was 
stripped of both their physical belongings and a significant 
part of their identity.
As a Tamil from Jaffna, I feel it is incumbent upon us to ac-
knowledge our collective responsibility in this heinous act. 
Our silence and inaction contributed to the perpetuation 
of this injustice. The time is now for the Sri Lankan govern-
ment, Tamil diaspora, and concerned authorities to facili-
tate a peaceful return for these displaced individuals. It is a 
moral imperative to restore the dignity and rights of those 
uprooted, ensuring their rightful place in the land they once 
called home.
In our series of articles, we delve deeper into this dark 
chapter of Sri Lankan history, aiming to shed light on the 
stories of those affected and the path to reconciliation and 
restoration. It is a journey of coming to terms with our past, 
confronting uncomfortable truths, and striving towards a 
future where such tragedies are never repeated.

Jaffna's Fateful Day
On October 30, 1990, an ominous tension permeated 
the air in Jaffna around 10:30 a.m. LTTE trucks began 
making rounds in areas where Muslims lived, such 
as Sonaka Theru, Ottumadam, Bommaively, and a 
few other neighborhoods. Their loudspeakers blared 
directives for Muslim families to assemble at the 
Jinnah Stadium of Osmania College by noon. These 
trucks crisscrossed the streets of these localities, 
ensuring their stern message reached every Muslim 
household. Armed LTTE members began patrolling 
the streets, with some making direct house-to-
house announcements. People quickly dropped their 
activities and rushed to the assembly point. 
The Ultimatum
By 12:30 p.m., a high-ranking LTTE leader named 
Anchaneyar ( Ilamparithi) appeared. He addressed the 
anxious crowd. His message was brief and precise; the 
LTTE high command had, citing security concerns, 
decided that all Muslims should vacate Jaffna within 
a mere two-hour window. Any failure to comply 
would lead to severe consequences. Within the LTTE's 
lexicon, such severe consequences were often a dire 
euphemism for a death sentence. The crowd was left 
stunned, and no additional clarification was provided. 
At this moment, a segment of the public naively 
started believing that the army was on the brink of 
invading Jaffna. They thought that the "our boys," were 
attempting to safeguard the Muslim community by 
removing them from potential war zones. Amidst this 
confusion, a few individuals, including the parents 
whose children had been LTTE fighters and had 
sacrificed their lives for the Tamil Eelam cause, stepped 
forward. Among them was Abdul Rahim's father. They 
sought to engage Ilamparithi in conversation, hoping 
for clarity. To drive home his message, Ilamparithi 
fired his gun into the air repeatedly, and several of his 
bodyguards mirrored his action.
The Looting and Plunder 
Abdul Rahim's father and others like him held onto 
hope. They referred to the LTTE as "Our boys," with 
a passionate belief that these boys would never harm 
them. Yet, many Muslims, acquainted with the LTTE's 
way of operation, took precautionary measures, wisely 
packing up their possessions, including money and 
jewelry, ready for whatever might ensue. 
Initially, Muslims were not given specific limitations 
regarding what they could carry. Naturally, they 
packed all their valuables. As they assembled at the 
"Ainthuchanthi" junction, they faced a new directive. 
LTTE male and female cadres began insisting that the 
Muslim residents surrender all their valuables. When 
some individuals protested the confiscation of their 
hard-earned assets, they were met with a curt reply 
from the LTTE cadres: "Whatever is earned in Tamil 
Eelam belongs to Tamil Eelam." When some tried to 
protest, they were swiftly silenced by the menacing 
display of advanced weaponry and stern threats. Bags 
filled with clothes and other possessions were seized. 
All forms of monetary assets and crucial documents 
like property deeds and checkbooks were taken away.
The harsh measures went beyond mere orders. In acts 
of degradation, women and girls faced the forcible 
stripping of their jewellery. Female cadres of the LTTE 
would violently tear earrings from the ears of Muslim 
women, resulting in wounds and bleeding. The 
ruthlessness extended even to children, from whom 
every watch was taken. In some instances, both men 
and women endured additional humiliation, being 
completely disrobed to guarantee they were not hiding 
gold on their bodies.
Amid this chaos, wealthy Muslim businessmen 
became targets. At least 35 of them were abducted, and 
a select few jewellers faced unspeakable torture, forced 
to disclose the whereabouts of hidden gold. The horror 
culminated with one being savagely beaten to death, a 
morbid warning to others.

The Spread of Forced Evictions
The forced eviction of Muslims from the Jaffna 
peninsula started in Chavakachcheri on October 15, 
1990, reaching its climax in Jaffna town by October 
30. An event leading up to these incidents happened 
on September 4, 1990. Close to the Chavakachcheri 
mosque, a confrontation arose between some Tamils 
and Muslims. Young Muslim individuals captured 
a few of the involved Tamils and handed them to 
the LTTE. Nevertheless, the LTTE released these 
individuals, cautioning the Muslim community not to 
provoke the Tamils.
Subsequent to this event, the LTTE reported finding 
75 swords in a store owned by a noted Muslim 
businessman. The credibility of these claims, however, 
is debated. The LTTE contended that they found the 
swords in a shop belonging to a Muslim trader whose 
vehicles regularly travelled between the town and 
Colombo. The LTTE used this finding as "proof" of a 
Muslim collaboration with the Sinhala government. 
But the rationale for amassing 75 swords, especially 
compared to the LTTE's superior arsenal, raises 
questions.
A Misguided Notion of 
Protection:
Perhaps most perplexing is the argument 
posited by a fringe group of LTTE advocates 
who suggest that the expulsion was, 
paradoxically, an act of care. They claim that 
the LTTE was shielding the Muslims from 
the horrors of War by removing them from 
conflict zones. This narrative, however, is 
starkly at odds with the lived experience of 
those who were uprooted, losing their homes, 
possessions, and livelihoods overnight.
Independent Returns: Northern 
Muslims Resettle Without Aid
Despite the absence of dedicated initiatives for the 
resettlement of Muslims forced out of the North, with the 
advent of peace, these families began to independently 
return to their ancestral lands.
While a number of families in Jaffna have benefited from 
government support in their resettlement efforts, it has been 
reported that numerous others have not been able to return 
home, primarily because no systematic resettlement scheme 
was put into place for the displaced Muslim communities.
