Sources close to both Achchuthan and 
Kumaran Pathmanathan (alias KP), the 
then-LTTE Head of International Relations, 
revealed to Jaffna Monitor that Achchuthan 
was instrumental in orchestrating KP's 
removal from his position in 2001. After KP's 
ousting, Castro was appointed to take over the 
role.
A credible source revealed to Jaffna Monitor 
that the late LTTE intelligence leader 
Vinayagam, who recently passed away in 
France, had confided that Achchuthan made 
repeated, unreasonable, and often malicious 
allegations against KP. Vinayagam reportedly 
told this source that he had personally 
witnessed these accusations. According 
to Vinayagam, Achchuthan and his team 
harbored an ultimate plan to remove KP from 
his position as the LTTE's international head. 
Their motive, Vinayagam suggested, was to 
gain control over LTTE funds and siphon them 
off with Castro's (V.Mannivannan) assistance. 
Though Castro was a dedicated fighter, he 
reportedly harbored a personal dislike for KP 
for reasons known only to him.
Credible sources revealed to Jaffna Monitor 
that Achchuthan even met with Pottu 
Amman, the LTTE's intelligence chief, to 
present allegedly fabricated documents 
aimed at implicating KP. Achchuthan 
reportedly disseminated these allegations 
to key individuals close to Prabhakaran,

including a trusted confidant of the LTTE supremo 
living abroad. These accusations portrayed KP 
as a rogue operator who acted independently, 
misappropriated funds, and—most damagingly—
overcharged for arms procurement.
This narrative gained significant traction, 
ultimately influencing Prabhakaran, who was 
known for his unwavering stance on financial 
integrity. "Prabhakaran could tolerate many things, 
but dishonesty with money was not one of them," a 
source remarked.
According to insiders, Achchuthan convinced the 
LTTE leadership that arms procurement could 
be handled at a significantly lower cost than what 
KP was allegedly managing. While it remains 
uncertain whether Prabhakaran fully believed 
these claims, the campaign was persuasive enough 
to lead to KP's removal from his role as the LTTE's 
Head of International Relations in 2001.

However, the new team under Castro, 
which took over the LTTE's international 
operations and arms procurement, faced 
significant setbacks. They were unable to 
secure even a single arms shipment, leaving 
the organization's resources severely strained. 
By late 2008, a frustrated Prabhakaran 
reappointed KP.
Another source, once close to Achchuthan 
and his brothers, told Jaffna Monitor that 
Achchuthan and his brother often claimed to 
close friends that, following KP's removal in 
2001, it was they who kept him under house 
arrest in Malaysia, allegedly confining him to a 
serviced apartment. Achchuthan and his circle 
frequently boasted about having control over 
KP during this time.
However, sources close to KP strongly refute 
this narrative, emphasizing that KP—a 
man renowned for his resourcefulness and 
audacity—was far from being an appa koppai 
(a colloquial term for someone extremely 
naive or gullible) who could be subdued 
by Achchuthan and his family. The claim, 
they argue, is yet another exaggerated tale 
in Achchuthan's arsenal to inflate his role in 
LTTE history.

A credible source recounted a particularly 
intriguing story to Jaffna Monitor. When the 
shocking news of LTTE leader Prabhakaran's 
death reached them, KP, Achchuthan, and 
a few other international operatives were in 
Indonesia, operating under assumed identities. 
Recognizing the gravity of the situation, KP 
decided to officially announce Prabhakaran's 
death to the Tamil community the following 
day. They went to bed that night, prepared to 
confront the somber task in the morning.
However, when dawn broke, Achchuthan 
vanished without a trace. Along with him, a 
substantial sum of cash had also disappeared, 
according to a source close to the incident.
Within three months of the LTTE's defeat and 
the death of its leader, Prabhakaran, KP was 
apprehended in Malaysia on August 5, 2009, 
by Sri Lankan intelligence. The high-profile 
arrest sent shockwaves through LTTE circles 
abroad, instilling fear among the remnants still 
in hiding.
Credible sources reveal that Achchuthan, 
who was also in Malaysia at the time of KP's 
arrest, wasted no time in fleeing. Abandoning 
everything, he boarded the next available flight 
to Switzerland and eventually sought refuge in 
France. As a French citizen, Achchuthan likely 
recognized that France offered him a greater 
sense of security and protection than any other 
country.
A source close to Achchuthan and his family 
disclosed that the brothers nurtured a deep-
seated grudge against KP, holding him 
responsible for their inclusion on the Interpol 
watch list in 2010. The source explained that 
KP was the only individual with detailed 
knowledge of their operations in Malaysia 
and other countries, making him uniquely 
positioned to expose their activities. The 
family believes that, after KP's arrest, he 
deliberately leaked this information, resulting 
in their names being added to Interpol's list 
and fueling their resentment toward him.
