Debunking Achchuthan's 
LTTE Narrative
Despite the image he likes to project, Achchuthan was 
neither a trained LTTE member nor sent abroad by the 
LTTE for studies or a special mission, according to credible 
sources who spoke with Jaffna Monitor. As a student at 
Jaffna Hindu College, he and his elder brother, Pathipan, 
reportedly engaged in minor activities for the LTTE. 
Following these actions, Achchuthan was apprehended by 
the Indian Army, which led his concerned parents to send 
both him and Pathipan abroad for their safety.
Credible LTTE insiders assert that claims of Achchuthan 
being sent overseas on an LTTE mission or for specialized 
training are pure fabrication. While he was a supporter, he 
had no official affiliation with the LTTE when he left Sri 
Lanka. In fact, the first in his family to formally join the 
LTTE was his younger brother, Lankeswaran Sivarasa.
According to these sources, the narrative that Achchuthan 
has carefully crafted—that he traveled to France to study 
aviation for the LTTE—is pure fiction. From 1992 to 1996, 
Achchuthan initially worked as a team leader and chef 
at Disneyland Paris. Later, he received flight training at 
Fly Academy Lognes, located at Aérodrome de Lognes in 
France, where he learned to fly small crop-dusting planes. 
Some suggest he pursued this training on his own, while 
others speculate that he was encouraged by LTTE contacts. 
Regardless, the story Achchuthan tells differs significantly 
from the reality of his journey.
A senior LTTE leader recalls that Achchuthan's 
initial involvement with the organization in France 
began with fundraising efforts. During this period, he 
connected with prominent LTTE operatives, including 
Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP, who was impressed 
by Achchuthan's proficiency in English and his apparent 
skill set. Sources say they encouraged him to pursue pilot 
training, recognizing his potential. In time, Achchuthan 
was assigned to work directly under KP—a relationship 
that would later take an ironic 
twist, as Achchuthan and his 
brothers betrayed the very man 
they once served.
However, after KP's 
reinstatement as head of the 
LTTE's international wing in late 
2008, reliable sources confirm 
that Achchuthan was once again 
tasked with working closely 
alongside him.
