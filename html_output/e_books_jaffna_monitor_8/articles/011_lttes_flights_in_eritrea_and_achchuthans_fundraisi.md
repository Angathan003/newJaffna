A
t the time of the LTTE's military defeat 
and the death of its leader, Prabhakaran, 
in May 2009, approximately 10 LTTE aircraft 
were reportedly stationed in Eritrea. Eritrea, 
a nation that gained independence from 
Ethiopia in 1993 after a prolonged struggle, 
shares a history that resonates with the Sri 
Lankan Tamil cause. Sources suggest that 
President Isaias Afwerki sympathized with 
the Sri Lankan Tamil cause and, by extension, 
the LTTE's efforts, allowing Eritrea to serve 
as a strategic base for LTTE operations. A 
few LTTE operatives who went to Eritrea 
reportedly built a respectful rapport with the 
ruling government.

After the LTTE's collapse at the 
Nandikadal Lagoon, sources 
within the LTTE's foreign division 
confirmed that roughly 10 LTTE 
aircraft remained stationed in Eritrea. 
Credible sources told Jaffna Monitor 
that following the LTTE's defeat, 
Achchuthan and his brothers allegedly 
began raising funds under the pretext 
of maintaining these aircraft. A source 
who had previously contributed 
financially disclosed that he personally 
donated over 1,000 euros on multiple 
occasions. Reportedly, Achchuthan 
and his brothers collected 15,000 euros 
each month, citing aircraft upkeep as 
the reason. However, sources allege 
that around 2015, Achchuthan sold off 
the planes and diverted the proceeds 
for personal gain, leaving Tamil 
supporters unaware of the true fate of 
the funds and aircraft.
Another credible source told Jaffna Monitor that 
in the final days of the war, Achchuthan's and his 
team collected large sums of money across Europe 
by claiming he would personally pilot a flight to 
rescue LTTE supremo Prabhakaran. Sources say 
this narrative helped them amass substantial funds, 
playing on the hopes and desperation of supporters.
