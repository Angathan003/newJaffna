# Achchuthan's Bid for LTTE's Throne

A 
credible source informed Jaffna Monitor 
about a conversation with Achchuthan 
during a meeting in a European country a 
few months ago. After a few glasses of wine, 
Achchuthan reportedly revealed his ambition. 
According to the source, Achchuthan appeared 
serious when he claimed that he alone was 
capable of leading the remnants of the LTTE. 
His reasoning, as stated, was based on his 
status as the last surviving senior leader of one 
of the LTTE's tri-forces.
According to a source close to Achchuthan, his 
reasoning is as follows: Following the death of 
Colonel Shankar (Vaithilingam Sornalingam), 
the founder and chief of the LTTE's Air 
Wing, in September 2001, Achchuthan briefly 
assumed leadership of the Air Wing for a few 
months—though some dispute this, claiming 
he never actually led the Sky Tigers.
Achchuthan argued that this brief role granted 
him a unique legacy, as he had once headed 
one of the three major divisions of the LTTE. 
When reminded of others still alive, such as 
Janarthan, the former leader of the Jeyanthan 
Regiment, Achchuthan contended that those 
leaders commanded only sub-divisions, 
whereas he had been entrusted with one 
of the LTTE's core pillars, a role integral to 
Prabhakaran's vision.
However, sources close to Achchuthan suggest 
a different motive: he and his brothers are 
allegedly driven by a desire to seize control 
over the remnants of the LTTE diaspora 
network, ensuring a steady "waterfall" of 
millions of euros into their coffers. To bolster 
their standing, Achchuthan and his brothers 
are said to have fabricated numerous tales to 
impress naive members of the diaspora.
In one particularly audacious claim, one of 
the brothers reportedly told naive diaspora 
Tamils—an account witnessed by a reliable 
source—that, in the final moments of the war, 
their beloved Thesiya Thalaivar Prabhakaran 
had allegedly called them and instructed, 
"If anything happens to me... please lead 
the organization." When Jaffna Monitor 
approached other former LTTE leaders for 
their opinion on this claim—fully aware of its 
absurdity but curious to hear their reactions—
they responded with a barrage of colorful and 
unprintable Tamil expletives.
Another former close associate of Achchuthan 
disclosed to Jaffna Monitor that this ambition 
fuels Achchuthan and his inner circle to stir 
up unrest in Sri Lanka, whether through the 
murder of someone critical of the LTTE, a 
bomb blast, or any disruptive act, no matter 
how small. According to this source, if 
Achchuthan's team orchestrated even a minor 
incident in Sri Lanka, they would quickly be 
hailed as heroes among a faction of trouble-
seeking members of the Tamil diaspora, 
especially in Switzerland. "With a single small 
bomb blast or gunshot in Sri Lanka," he stated, 
"they could raise millions of euros within 
hours—and that is their bloody motive."

Future North 
T
his piece is based on work initiated to catapult the 
Northern Province to become the iconic frontier 
province for other Provinces to follow. It’s driven by a belief 
our people past and present have become global citizens 
from the 1920’s. Today they possess enormous knowledge, 
skills, resources and connectivity. The text shows the 
breadth of options available to transform the Province.  
Several States of India undertake similar and visioning 
exercises including promoting themselves in select global 
destinations. 
The Governor as CEO 
In any enterprise the hand and direction the CEO provides 
is fundamental for the success or its failure. I speak of 
the Governor who can sit back and enjoy the perks and 
comforts of office, work hard to ensure personal pecuniary 
and posessional gain (i.e. % as commission for approvals,

appropriating state land, commissions on 
government relief for citizens, pocessional gifts 
in lieu of approvals for commercial enterprises, 
fine tuning service records, having several 
vehicle accidents where animals are named 
as the primary cause, cavalier use of vehicles 
to cite a few living examples), sign only what 
officials  send and listen only to what officials 
want you to know and do what they want you 
to do0  make it ones business to ensure you 
know the acts of commission or omission 
of the officials ( 35,000 out of an approved 
cadre of 40,000) or make its every state 
entity and officials including the Governor 
priority and imperative  the safety, security 
and development of 401,000 families in the 
Province. 
Governors have rank of Cabinet Ministers. The 
Governor can make it his or her business to 
come on behalf the citizens with all Ministry 
Secretaries, Five District Secretaries and thirty 
four Divisional Secretaries reporting. No 
response should wait beyond 24 hours. Every 
response within the system must demand 
follow up action. Tri service Commanders, the 
SDIG should be met frequently. Every Central 
agency required to support the Province 
should not only be written but also met direct. 
Four Governors of Tamil origin including the 
incumbent have been seen in the Province. 
This is the fire and sense of purpose the Office 
of Governor can generate. The intelligentsia, 
officials, citizens, intelligence agency reports 
and media have a fair knowledge of how we 
have functioned and behaved todate. 
I pay tribute to Governor General (Rtd) 
Chandrasiri who set the bar for work of a 
Governor in the Province soon after 2009. 
Fair to say a majority of officials responded 
unflinchingly with the poor Chief Secretary 
bearing the brunt of the follow up load. 
Unfortunately, in government sudden 
Machiavellian needs to derail the progress 
of opposition parties or self driven interests 
requires wrecking anything as long it achieves 
the political objectives. On 15th May 2023 a 
journey in the Province was disrupted due 
such a political emergency in Colombo with 
quid pro quo rewards to be given bringing 
disrepute to the Election Commission as the 
Supreme Court deemed fit to describe their 
actions including one chosen for special 
mention.  
A legislated  authority to develop a 
Province
In the mid 90’s a development authority was 
set up for the Southern Province. A similar  
authority for   Northern Sri Lanka should 
be responsible for the matters relating to 
the planning, execution and monitoring of 
development schemes and projects in the 
Northern Region. Its vision to accelerate the 
pace of socio-economic development of the 
so that the districts of the North enjoy growth 
parity with the rest of the country (some words 
mirror intent of a similar instrument for North 
east India).
The mission would be to derive maximum 
benefits from reserved, concurrent and 
provincial schedules of the 13th Amendment; 
A single window harmonising plans and 
policies in collaboration with Central 
Ministries and the Province for the rapid 
development of the region; Intensive 
monitoring to ensure full utilisation of 
Budgetary Support; Strengthening institutions, 
promoting social harmony and augmenting 
capacity with a view to encourage flow of 
private investment to increase development 
opportunities.
Objectives include raising private finances 
for investments, returns and development;  
Attracting local and foreign investor funds, be 
it big or small;  Generating revenue through

Creating a wealth owning community of 
citizens from the province, attracting surplus 
wealth of Sri Lankans overseas;  Ensuring 
revenue from development is earmarked 
in part to long stay citizens in the province 
as a pension fund contributing to a scheme

The  emphasis on save and grow through

of ultimate beneficiaries as a long-term

generations get to benefit. Development Bonds

Cilappatikaram: a timeless 
Tamil classic that transcends 
time and ethnic boundaries

H
ow true!.…. and if in doubt, ask the 
President who ran away, “spurned like 
a cur” by his millions. Cilappatikaram is 
perhaps the oldest Tamil classic from the 
Sangam period and is credited to the Jain 
poet ‘Ilango Adigal’ – the saintly brother of 
a Chera King. At the heart of this poem is 
the story of three ordinary folks – Kovalan, 
Kannagi and Madhavi, who are caught in a 
web of love, marriage, infidelity, betrayal and 
the miscarriage of justice attributed to the 
forces of destiny. This ancient story is also well 
known amongst many other cultures in South 
India and Sri Lanka. The dating of Sangam 
literature - including Cilappatikaram, is a 
matter of contention. The renowned social 
anthropologist Gananath Obeyesekera, in his 
book ‘The cult of the goddess Pattini’ states 
that Cilappatikaram was “probably composed 
during the period A.D 500-800”. Others argue 
that, since Cilappatikaram mentions the 
names of two kings – Senguttuwan (from the 
Chera Kingdom) and Gajabahu (or ‘Kajavahu’ 
From Sri Lanka) who ruled their respective 
kingdoms in the 2nd century AD, to have 
been present at the consecration of a temple 
to Kannagi, an earlier date of 2nd century AD 
may be more appropriate. However, whether 
Senguttuwan and Gajabahu, are true historical 
figures or merely legendary characters, perhaps 
from a distant past, remains a matter of 
speculation. 
The miscarriage of justice at the Pandian court 
in Madurai results in the wrongful conviction 
of Kovalan for robbery of the queen’s Anklet. 
As a result Kovalan is executed on the orders 
of the Pandian King- Nedunchelian, who 
fails in his duty to ensure a fair process in the 
enquiry and the subsequent dispensation of 
justice. Kannagi, the virtuous wife of Kovalan, 
having proven her husband’s innocence, 
seeks revenge on the people who wronged 
her beloved. As a result of Kannagi’s wrath 
and through the powers of her piety, chastity 
and virtue, King Nedunchelian dies and the 
city of Madurai is reduced to ashes. “Injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” – 
the people of Madurai certainly experienced 
it in Kannagi’s fury. Whether Kannagi’s 
reaction to her personal grief, and the 
collective punishment inflicted on the people 
of Madurai, was justifiable in this context is a 
question that is poorly discussed amongst the 
readers of Cilappathikaram. It certainly will 
not sit comfortably in a modern court of law – 
legal or moral.
The noble child – Manimehalai, born out of 
wedlock through the forbidden love between 
Kovalan and his lover Madhavi, goes on to 
become the central figure in the other Tamil 
Buddhist classic from the Sangam period, 
Manimehalai.  Buddhism certainly had deep 
roots within Tamil culture- perhaps amongst 
segments of the hindu society, who could 
not come to terms with some of the divisive

rightful honour and 
dignity that belongs 
to that person is

history.
iii.	 The cruel hand of 
fate – referred to 
as ‘ool-vinai’ (in 
Tamil) or ‘Daivaya’ 
(in Sinhala) does 
play a role in all our 
lives and needs to be 
taken into account 
in understanding 
events that surround 
us. 
In addition to these 
timeless moral lessons, 
Cilappatikaram also 
places on record 
several key features 
that are essential in 
understanding Tamil 
culture during the 
Sangam period and its 
subsequent evolution. It 
Vedic practices and rituals. The Chera king Senguttuwan, having 
heard the story of Kannagi bestows a status of divinity on her, 
thus initiating a tradition of Kannagi worship, which, over the 
centuries, has become an integral component of culture mainly 
amongst the rural/coastal communities in South India and Sri 
Lanka. According to Gananath Obeyesekera, Kannagi should be 
seen as a “deity of the heterodox religions – Buddhism, Jainism and 
Ajivakism”. Obeyesekera, however does not deny the possibility 
that Kannagi may indeed be one of the many goddesses of the 
Hindu pantheon. He confirms the South Indian Tamil origins of 
Kannagi (Pattini) worship and its subsequent diffusion into the Sri 
Lankan society, where it found a broad appeal amongst the Sinhala 
and Tamil people. What then are the key moral principles that 
underpin this timeless classic?
One could identify three strong themes that emerge from a deep 
analysis of Cilappatikaram. Namely
 The new look of Vattapalai Kannagi Amman temple, following extensive renovations

day. The concepts of ‘Sruti’ (or pitch), ‘lyam’ (or rhythm) and 
‘Bhavam’ (or expression) are well articulated, albeit indirectly, 
and give strong pointers that the origins of classical South Indian 
music and dance to be rooted within popular Tamil culture 
during (or preceding) the Sangam era (3rd century BCE to 3rd 
century CE). 
Following her early blissful married life and the subsequent 
betrayal of her trust by Kovalan in Puhar (in the Chola 
kingdom), Kovalan and Kannagi move to the city of Madurai 
(in the Pandiyan Kingdom) where Kovalan is the victim of 
miscarriage of justice. Following her dramatic display of fury, 
by the public dismembering of her left breast and her curse 
that burns Madurai, Kannagi finds her way to the land of the 
Cheras (modern day Kerala), where she is conferred a state of 
divinity. Chera King Chenkuttuvan orders the construction 
of a statue for Kannagi and the consecration ceremony is 
described by Ramachandra Dikshitar (1896-1953) – another 
renowned Indologist and Dravidologist, as follows. “To that 
venerable lady was dedicated, by the united aid of the Dharmic 
Brahamanas, Purohitas, Astrologers and expert sculptors, a shrine 
presents an insight into 
the position of women 
in ancient Tamil society 
as an active decision-
making partner rather 
than a passive dependant 
under the patronage of the 
husband. In contrast, for 
example, women’s voices 
had little if any impact 
in Homer’s Odyssey 
where Telemachos, the 
son of Odysseus, says 
that ‘all power in society 
is the business of men’. 
The virtual subjugation 
of Penelope, Odysseus’s 
wife, in the absence of her 
husband by the potential 
suitors from adjacent 
kingdoms confirms the 
subservient role played by 
women in ancient Greek 
society. Cilappathikaram 
also highlights the diverse 
range of social classes, and 
how an ordinary citizen 
had to navigate these 
differences in daily life. 
The author also places on 
record the performance 
of dance and music at the 
royal courts alluding to 
the rules that governed 
these art forms. Wind 
instruments (Kulal), string 
instruments (Yarl) and 
percussion instruments 
(Murasu) are mentioned 
and possibly were the 
precursors of similar 
categories of instruments 
that are in widespread use 
in Carnatic music and 
Bharatha Natyam, to this 
 Illustration of Kannagi in the court of the Pandya king.

(Pattinikkottam), constructed in all its parts according to the 
prescribed rules so that it might win the approval of the wise. 
Therein was planted the image of Pattini, carved with expert 
handiwork upon the stone brought from the Himalayan slope, 
the residences of gods, after prayers to the god on the top of those 
hills”  (Gananath Obeyesekera. The cult of the goddess Pattini. 
1984).
Thus began the tradition of Kannagi (or Pattini) worship, 
which was subsequently introduced to Sri Lanka where 
it remains a popular belief system, mainly in the coastal 
regions of the country. To this day she remains a popular 
deity, people turn to in 
times of disease, drought, 
famine and destitution. The 
resurgence of Saivaism or 
Vaishnavism through the 
Bakthi movement between 
the 6th-12th centuries in 
South India – with Shiva 
and Vishnu as the key 
deities, does not seem to 
have blunted the enthusiasm 
found amongst the rural 
Nawagamuwa Pattini Devalaya

populations for Kannaki (or Pattini). The 
popularity of Kannagi Temples of Vattappalai 
(in the Mullaitivu district) or Pungudu Tivu 
(Jaffna district) as places of adoration and sites 
for annual pilgrimages bears testimony to this 
timeless devotion to Kannaki amongst Tamils. 
Amongst the Sinhala people “the worship of 
goddess Pattini was most popular in the coastal 
regions of the Western and Southern provinces 
and in the province of Sabaragamuwa, which 
lies in the interior of Sri Lanka adjacent to these 
two provinces. She is also propitiated in the 
Kandyan region, particularly in and around 
the main cities of the old Kandyan kingdom 
– that is, Kandy itself, Matale, Hanguranketa 
and Badulla. The goddess is constantly referred 
to as Pattini of Nawagamuwa because her 
main shrine is in a village of that name in the 
Colombo district. This main shrine is a tiny, 
unimposing structure totally overshadowed by 
the Buddhist temple that has since been built on 
the same premises”. (Gananath Obeyesekera, 
The Cult of the Goddess Pattini. 1984). 
             
The term ‘Cult’ used by Gananath Obeyesekera 
to describe Kannaki (or Pattini) worship is, in 
many ways, unfortunate as it gives the readers 
a tinted or biased view of a people’s faith, 
which, in this case is no different to any other 
form of deity worship – the personification of 
an eternal and formless god. The fact that an 
ordinary woman, born in the imaginations of a 
Tamil speaking Jain poet living in South India, 
has been able to capture the imagination and 
adoration of a large number of people living 
across several religious-socio-political barriers 
in the three kingdoms of ancient South India – 
the Cheras, Cholas and the Pandiyas, and the 
Buddhists and Hindus living of Sri Lanka is, in 
its own right, a very significant phenomenon.  
Kannagi epitomises the virtues of integrity, 
honesty, chastity and the willingness to 
stand up to authority in the face of injustice. 
Injustice experienced by a woman of such

qualities seems to resonate deep within human 
conscience, evoking powerful sentiments within all 
people – despite any social, religious or linguistic 
differences that may exist between them. The ability 
to face up to and fight (and win) against injustice 
seems to elevate the status of such individuals to 
even above the more traditional gods. Legend has 
it that Goddess Meenakshi descended on earth 
to quench the rage of Kannaki in order to save 
the wider region from destruction, implying that 
Kannaki was considered more powerful than the 
consort of Lord Shiva – the source of all creative 
energies in the cosmos (Shakthi). In 
some, perhaps more secular quarters, 
Kannagi is seen as a revolutionary who 
challenged authority and demanded 
justice from the king rather than 
pleading for it. The ability of a single 
destitute women to bring an entire 
kingdom to a grinding halt may even 
be seen as a precursor to female power 
and empowerment widely discussed 
in modern society. Thus the appeal 
of Cilappatikaram goes beyond mere

uprisings and their brutal suppressions in the South resulting 
in the bankruptcy of an entire nation’s economy. A detailed and 
diligent study of Cilappatikaram, perhaps in our schools in the 
Sinhala, Tamil and English media provides an opportunity to 
reconsider this approach. Such a bold move may even help to 
evolve a more inclusive approach to nation-building, sustainable 
peace and an era of co-existence through mutual respect. The 
deep rooted devotion to a Tamil mythological goddess at times 
of great personal anguish and suffering – by people on either 
side of the ethnic divide, must amount to something more than 
literary interest alone.                                         
religious sentiments and/
or blind devotion. 
Cilappatikaram also 
displays the co-existence 
of multiple faiths and the 
diversity of society in the 
Sangam period. While 
leaving Puhar, Kannagi 
and Kovalan pass by a 
Vishnu temple, seven 
Buddhist Viharas and 
wondering Jain ascetics 
all within close proximity 
to each other. History 
and literature have great 
inherent value and as such 
may be considered as an 
end in themselves. Ilango 
Adigal’s composition can 
and must be respected 
and valued for its 
literary beauty and the 
art of compelling story-
telling. Nevertheless, the 
opportunities available 
to all of us to deploy 
history and literature 
as agents for change 
within our troubled 
and divided society also 
must not be missed. The 
political leaders and 
some academics of post-
independence Sri Lanka, 
in their wisdom, have 
largely chosen to deploy 
literature and history as 
tools for division and 
disharmony. The long 
term consequences of this 
short sighted approach is 
apparent to all of us who 
have witnessed 30+ years 
of war in the North-East 
along with the two bloody
