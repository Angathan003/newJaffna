I Have a Dream
S
ri Lanka has undergone a seismic political 
transformation unparalleled in its modern chronicles. 
The Parliamentary Elections of 2024 will be immortalized 
as the epoch when the populace obliterated the deeply 
entrenched ramparts of ethnicity, religion, caste, and 
class. In a thunderous proclamation, they affirmed with 
unyielding conviction: We are Sri Lankans.
For decades, Jaffna has been regarded as the citadel 
of Tamil nationalism, with a longstanding history of 
electing exclusively Tamil parties. Yet, in a tectonic shift, 
80,830 votes—a remarkable 24.85% of the electorate—
catapulted the Sri Lankan nationalist National People's 
Power (NPP) to the forefront, making it the leading force 
on Jaffna's electoral list and securing three Members of 
Parliament from this historically symbolic soil. A similar 
trend emerged across other Tamil-speaking districts, 
with the notable exception of Batticaloa, marking an 
unprecedented realignment of political allegiances.
The winds of change blew even stronger in Trincomalee, 
where a young Tamil comrade, Arun Hemachandra, an 
indefatigable JVP volunteer—achieved a historic victory. 
His triumph was not anchored in ethnic loyalties but was 
instead secured through the overwhelming support of 
Sinhala and Muslim voters. Given that the electorate had 
already elected an ITAK MP from the same district in this 
election, it was mathematically impossible for the Tamil 
vote alone to secure another Tamil MP for Trincomalee. 
It is, therefore, clear that Sinhala and Muslim voters 
played a decisive role in elevating Arun Hemachandra as 
their Member of Parliament, heralding a remarkable shift 
towards inclusive and collaborative politics.
But the crown jewel of this election lies far to the south, 
in Matara—a district predominantly Sinhala, with only a 
minimal Tamil presence. Here, history was made as Saroja

Savithri Paulraj, a JVP Central Committee member, became the first 
Tamil Member of Parliament elected from the Southern Province. 
Backed exclusively by Sinhala votes, Saroja's victory stands as a 
profound testament to the evolving ethos of the Sinhala heartland. 
Joining her from the same district is Arkam Ilyas, a Muslim 
candidate under the NPP banner, further signaling the inclusive and 
pluralistic future Sri Lanka is poised to embrace.
In the upcountry estates, a quiet revolution unfolded as Krishnan 
Kaleychelvi from Nuwara Eliya and Ambika Samuel from 
Badulla—true children of the grassroots—emerged to represent the 
Malayaha Tamil community. In stark contrast to the elite gatekeepers 
of their community, who studied in English-medium opulent 
boarding schools in Tamil Nadu and whose politics often reek of 
extravagance and Tamil cinema theatrics, these leaders embody the 
sweat, resilience, and toil of estate laborers.
Sri Lankans have accomplished what many believed to be 
unthinkable—they have transcended deep-seated divisions to elect 
a government driven by collective aspirations rather than archaic 
allegiances. Yet, the lesson for the NPP is unequivocally stark: this 
very electorate once propelled the SLPP to unparalleled heights in 
2020, bestowing it with 6,853,693 votes, 59.09% of the mandate, 
and a commanding 145 seats. Fast forward four years, the same 
populace dismantled that dominance, slashing the SLPP's support 
to a meager 3.14% of the vote and a humiliating three seats. The 
message is crystal clear: power resides with the people, and they will 
not tolerate betrayal or hubris. Their trust is a privilege—precious 
yet perilously fragile. Tamper with their faith, and the fall will be 
unforgiving.
As we stand at this juncture of hope and history, I invoke the 
immortal words of Martin Luther King Jr., reimagined for our 
beloved Sri Lanka:
"I have a dream that one day, from the tip of Jaffna to the bottom 
of Matara, little Tamil boys and girls will join hands with Sinhala, 
Muslim, and Burgher boys and girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream that my children will one day live in a nation where 
they will not be judged by the race, religion, or caste of their 
ancestors but by the content of their character.

I have a dream that one day, in the lush estates of Nuwara Eliya, the bustling 
streets of Colombo, and the serene shores of Batticaloa, every Sri Lankan 
will be free to dream, thrive, and contribute without fear of discrimination.
I have a dream that the wounds of the past will no longer bleed, and the scars 
of war will transform into symbols of resilience and reconciliation."
I have a dream!
