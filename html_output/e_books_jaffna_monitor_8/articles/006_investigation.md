Achchuthan's Empire:
Unmasking the LTTE's
Covert Revival Network
The Double Life of Pugalenthi Master:
BY: 
Jaffna Monitor Investigation Team
A
n essential ally in Achchuthan's 
(Sivarasa Pirunthapan) network 
is his brother-in-law, Pugalenthi 
Master, a former intelligence leader 
within the LTTE. He earned the title 
"Master" by teaching LTTE fighters, 
as it was customary within the LTTE 
to refer to anyone who conducted 
training or classes for its fighters as 
"Master."
Pugalenthi Master, born as Pugalavan, 
is the elder brother of Sakalya 
Pirunthapan, whose LTTE alias was 
Rathika. Rathika, a dedicated second-
year medical student at the Tamil 
Eelam Medical College, underwent 
training within LTTE ranks before 
marrying Achchuthan on October 4, 
Pugalenthi Master

2004. The ceremony took place in Kilinochchi 
during a rare period of peace in Sri Lanka.
Sources close to the couple reveal that the 
marriage was arranged, with Achchuthan 
insisting on marrying a woman from the 
Vellalar caste, the same as his own. This 
decision was influenced by both family 
expectations and his strict adherence to 
caste traditions. Both Achchuthan and his 
father, Sivarasa—known for their strong 
caste views—were determined that his bride 
would align with specific caste standards. 
Reportedly, this insistence stemmed from the 
fact that Achchuthan's elder brother and one 
of his younger brothers had married women 
considered slightly lower in caste status than 
Vellalar, a situation that had allegedly caused 
some discontent within the family.
Pugalenthi Master, born as Pugalavan, 
hails from the villages of Vimankaman 
and Urumpirai. Born in the mid-1970s to 
Thevarajah, an apothecary, Pugalavan began 
his education at Mahajana College, where he 
studied until his O-Levels before transferring 
to St. John's College. His family has long-
standing connections with the LTTE.
His elder brother, Kesavan, played a 
significant role in the movement by working 
with the LTTE's bank and its radio station, 
Pulikalin Kural. Known as "Pulikalin Kural" 
Viswalingam, Kesavan was renowned for his 
political commentary and his participation in 
political debates aired on Pulikalin Kural.
Another sister, Muthamizhchelvi, is the 
only sibling in the family who did not join 
the LTTE. She resides in London with her 
husband, Vithuran, and works at the Tesco 
supermarket pharmacy on Southend Road, 
Woodford Green, IG8 8GE, United Kingdom. 
Meanwhile, her sister Sakalya, who is married 
to Achchuthan (Pirunthapan), lives in France 
at 6A Rue Rognon, Saint Pierre d'Autils, La

d'Autils-Longueville (Eure).
However, Pugalenthi Master and Sakalya 
never revealed their close familial 
relationship during their time in the Vanni 
or abroad, as confirmed by credible former 
LTTE sources who spoke to Jaffna Monitor.
A former LTTE fighter who worked closely 
with Pugalenthi Master for several years 
shared with Jaffna Monitor that he once 
believed Pugalenthi Master was fully 
transparent with him. He recalled seeing 
Pugalenthi Master and Sakalya together 
on multiple occasions, particularly around 
the time of the arrangements for Sakalya's 
marriage to Achchuthan. Despite this, 
Pugalenthi Master never disclosed that she 
was his sister.
Another source who knew Achchuthan 
well informed Jaffna Monitor that neither 
Achchuthan nor his wife ever publicly 
acknowledged their close familial 
connection to Pugalenthi Master. The 
source described them as "neUg;gDfs;" 
(a colloquial Tamil term meaning "very 
cunning people").
Sources indicate that Sakalya, born on 
September 24, 1976, in Pavakkulam, 
Vavuniya, was the first in her family to join 
the LTTE, likely around 1992–93 during 
her O-Level studies. Her elder brother, 
Pugalavan followed suit during the Jaffna 
displacement in 1995. He initially worked 
under Gnanavel, the then-head of LTTE 
intelligence operations in Jaffna, and later 
under Pradeep, who oversaw intelligence 
activities in the region.
Credible sources report that Pugalenthi 
Master eventually became part of Mathavan 
Master's team, handling veliyaga velai—
special external operations—primarily based 
in Colombo, where he assumed increasingly 
significant responsibilities.
Within LTTE ranks, Pugalenthi was known 
as an intellectual and an avid reader. He 
contributed to the intelligence wing's 
educational initiatives, editing several 
publications for the unit. Credible sources 
within the LTTE describe him as an expert 
in managing and planting double agents—a 
skill he later passed on to others in a series of 
training sessions. One source who attended 
these sessions in the mid-2000s recalled 
Pugalenthi's meticulous approach, especially 
in his lectures on handling double agents. 
Those who knew Pugalenthi personally often 
remarked on his bookish nature. A source who 
met him on multiple occasions described his 
room as perpetually filled with books, saying it 
"looked more like a library than a room."

strike never materialized. They 
remained in position until the 
final days of the war in May 
2009, awaiting orders that 
would never come.
The events that unfolded 
in the forests of Aasikulam 
remain etched in memory 
as a profound betrayal for 
the LTTE fighters involved. 
Members of the operation 
confided to Jaffna Monitor 
that Pugalenthi's behavior had 
grown increasingly suspicious, 
stirring unease among his 
squad. One fighter recalled 
that Pugalenthi often spoke 
on the phone with someone 
overseas—a contact whose 
identity was unclear at the 
time but is now believed to 
have been his brother-in-law, 
Achchuthan, with whom he 
was likely plotting his own 
escape.
Tensions between Pugalenthi 
and his team soon came to a 
Pugalenthi's Betrayal in Aasikulam: The Inside 
Story of Deception
Between January and February 2009, under direct 
orders from LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman and 
LTTE leader Prabhakaran, an elite team of Black Tiger 
commandos embarked on a high-stakes mission from 
Pudukkudiyiruppu, moving through Nedunkeni and into 
Aasikulam in Vavuniya. The exact objective of their mission 
remains shrouded in secrecy, with conflicting reports 
hinting at a planned strike on a significant military or public 
site in the South.
Despite Aasikulam being under government control, its 
proximity to LTTE-held areas and the cover provided by 
dense surrounding forests enabled LTTE presence. One 
Black Tiger operative involved in the mission confided to 
Jaffna Monitor that, from Aasikulam, it was possible to 
navigate westward along forest paths leading ultimately to 
Colombo.
This elite unit was commanded by Pugalenthi Master, with 
Nimalan, another intelligence leader. According to a reliable 
source, Pugalenthi Master and Nimalan had trained these 
fighters in Black Tiger camps.
By the end of February 2009, the team was fully embedded 
in Aasikulam. Yet, despite their preparations, the anticipated 
Pradeep
Madavan master

head. One fighter recounted that Pugalenthi frequently 
ignored essential security protocols, refusing to wear 
camouflage uniforms and leaving food wrappers, like 
biscuit packaging, scattered around. Another fighter 
recalled that Pugalenthi, known for his love of food, even 
insisted on having kottu roti brought from Vavuniya 
by a fighter who had traveled there from Aasikulam for 
intelligence work. This lack of discretion became a serious 
concern, culminating in a near altercation with one of the 
fighters over his cavalier attitude.
One source confided to Jaffna Monitor that, while the 
squad suspected Pugalenthi might be up to something, 
they never imagined he would abandon them entirely. Yet, 
within a few days, that's precisely what he did.
One evening, under the cover of dusk, Pugalenthi excused 
himself, pistol in hand, claiming he needed to go to the 
forest for a toilet break. Shortly afterward, Karvannan, a 
courageous fighter from the Sea Tigers, noticed suspicious 
movement in the direction where 
Pugalenthi had gone.
Concerned for Pugalenthi 
Master's safety, Karvannan 
informed the squad that he would 
check on him. As he approached 
the area, Karvannan spotted Sri 
Lankan Army soldiers moving 
into position. A skirmish erupted, 
and Karvannan was killed by 
a direct shot to the chest. The 
LTTE squad was forced to retreat, 
quickly relocating to avoid 
further casualties. The army later 
recovered Karvannan's body, 
but the squad had no trace of 
Pugalenthi's whereabouts.
Anxiety within the team escalated, 
turning to full-blown suspicion 
when they received a call from 
Pugalenthi himself, claiming 
he was safe and asking them 
to meet at a specific location. 
Meanwhile, an intelligence unit 
from Vanni cautioned them 
against reconnecting with 
Pugalenthi, warning he might 
either be in army custody or, given 
his expertise in training double 
agents, could have become one 
himself. Remaining fighters like 
Nimalan, Muhilan, Thamilselvan, 
and others grew increasingly wary, 
sensing the chilling possibility of 
betrayal.
A fighter from his squad told 
Jaffna Monitor that when they 
pressed Pugalenthi Master over 
the phone for details about his 
escape, he claimed he had taken a 
Sinhala family hostage at gunpoint 
in Aasikulam and was now living 
 Achchuthan

with them in Vavuniya town, using them 
as cover. To his comrades, the story seemed 
implausible. As one of them pointed out, 
"Aasikulam is primarily a Tamil area; there 
wouldn't be Sinhala families there. How could 
he have taken them hostage, and even if he 
had, how could one man with a single pistol 
control them and live in Vavuniya without 
raising suspicion?
A former LTTE fighter from the squad 
confided to Jaffna Monitor that he believes 
Pugalenthi was either captured by the army or 
orchestrated his escape with their assistance. 
Another squad member, now living abroad, 
speculated that Achchuthan and his brother, 
Ilankeswaran—both known for their sharp 
cunning—may have facilitated Pugalenthi's 
escape by leveraging military contacts.
During peacetime, Ilankeswaran operated 
covertly in Colombo for the LTTE, playing 
a role in the movement's procurement 
activities. A credible LTTE source informed 
Jaffna Monitor that Ilankeswaran even 
misappropriated funds during these 
operations—a story in itself. Given his time 
in Colombo, he likely established connections 
with authorities and military personnel, 
contacts he may have leveraged to ensure 
Pugalenthi's safe passage.
After Pugalenthi's disappearance, the 
remaining fighters found themselves in a dire 
financial crisis, as he had been responsible for 
managing their funds. One squad member 
confided to Jaffna Monitor that at one point, 
they were starving, left without any food. What 
followed was truly heartbreaking. As the war 
drew to its brutal conclusion in Mullivaikkal,

the fighters lost all contact with their 
command structure. Some surrendered to 
the ICRC, a few were killed by the Sri Lankan 
Army, and others managed to escape. A source 
revealed to Jaffna Monitor that some female 
fighters were killed by the army, their bodies 
later dragged away—a final, harrowing end for 
those who had once fought with fierce loyalty.
Sources reveal that, with the help of his 
brother-in-law Achchuthan, Pugalenthi 
Master meticulously planned his escape route, 
moving from Vavuniya to Mannar and then 
to Tamil Nadu by boat, where his family had 
also sought refuge after fleeing the war. For a 
few years, Pugalenthi lived quietly in India, 
but he was far from inactive. Credible sources 
indicate that during this time, he attempted to 
orchestrate several attacks in Sri Lanka from 
afar with Achchuthan's support.
The 2014 LTTE revival attempt stands out 
as one of the most serious and coordinated 
efforts to resurrect the group since its 
military defeat in May 2009. This operation 
was led by Suntharalingam Gajatheeban 
(alias Theiveegan), along with Navaratnam 
Navaneethan (alias Appan) and Ponniah 
Selvanayagam Kajeepan (alias Gobi). All three 
were ultimately killed in a Sri Lankan military 
operation. Credible sources within former 
LTTE ranks informed Jaffna Monitor that 
Achchuthan, his brother Ilankeswaran, and 
his brother-in-law Pugalenthi Master played 
a crucial role in the attempt. (We will delve 
further into this in our upcoming issues.)
Another notable incident came to light in 2016 
when Sri Lankan authorities seized a suicide 
jacket in Chavakacheri and arrested several 
LTTE operatives linked to the plot. Military 
Suicide jacket seized by Sri Lankan authorities in Chavakachcheri, 2016.

officials claimed that the jacket belonged to 
Pugalenthi Master and was intended for a 
high-profile assassination. Sources within the 
LTTE intelligence wing confirmed that this 
very jacket had indeed once been owned by 
Pugalenthi during his operations in Sri Lanka.
Sources say that from India, Pugalenthi Master 
embarked on a carefully orchestrated journey, 
traveling through Malaysia and other countries 
before ultimately reaching London. This escape 
route, primarily facilitated by his brother-in-
law Achchuthan, allowed Pugalenthi to evade 
capture and establish a new life in hiding. 
Now settled in London, his transition was 
further smoothed by the support of his sister, 
Muthamizhchelvi Vithuran. Muthamizhchelvi 
quietly assists Pugalenthi as he adjusts to life in 
the shadows from his base in London.
A former squad member from the Aasikulam 
forest confided to Jaffna Monitor that he is 
still searching for Pugalenthi Master. Knowing 
that Pugalenthi now resides in London, he 
expressed his determination to confront him 
and demand answers to unresolved questions:
"Are you the double agent you warned us 
about? How did you manage to escape from 
Aasikulam to Vavuniya? How could you 
live undetected in an army-controlled area 
by supposedly holding a Sinhala family 
at gunpoint? And while others in your 
squad faced death, how did you secure a 
path to safety? Was it your brother-in-law, 
Achchuthan, who orchestrated your escape by 
passing information to military intelligence?"
He went on to say he would confront 
Pugalenthi with these  ehf;if GLq;Fw 
(piercing) questions. Although some 
squad members eventually escaped, 
their retreat was described as ehq;fs; 
my;Nyhyfy;Nyhyg;gl;Lj;jhd; jg;gpNdhk; 
("we escaped in utter chaos")—in stark 
contrast to Pugalenthi, whose departure 
seemed deliberate and unscathed.
A former fighter posed a pointed question to 
Jaffna Monitor: "If Pugalenthi Master believes 
he has done nothing wrong, why is he in 
hiding?" This fighter suggests that Pugalenthi 
fully understands the weight of his actions. 
Another source, who once worked closely with 
Pugalenthi, revealed that many former LTTE 
intelligence members and associates have tried 
reaching out to him for a conversation. Yet, 
Pugalenthi remains as elusive as ever, carefully 
avoiding those who seek answers.
Pugalenthi's marriage to a woman from 
Puthukudiyiruppu—a civilian uninvolved 
with the LTTE—was discreetly arranged by a 
fellow fighter, Muhunthan. While our sources 
confirm that his wife and children now reside 
in India, Pugalenthi Master has carefully 
woven a narrative suggesting he and his wife 
are estranged or divorced. However, credible 
sources close to the family suggest otherwise, 
asserting that they remain very much together.
Pugalenthi Master resides in the UK without 
proper visa documentation, initially staying 
with his sister, Muthamizhchelvi, before 
relocating to a separate residence. Credible 
sources reveal that Achchuthan has traveled to 
the UK multiple times to meet his brother-in-
law, with Pugalenthi playing a pivotal role as 
a key strategist within Achchuthan's intricate 
web of deception.
Nimalan's saga
There's an intriguing story about Nimalan, one 
of the key figures in the Aasikulam operation. 
A native of Vallipuvanam, Puthukudiyiruppu, 
Nimalan was a highly skilled member of 
the LTTE intelligence wing who primarily 
operated undercover in Colombo, often in the 
heart of enemy territory. His covert work came

![p023_i1.jpg](images_out/006_investigation/p023_i1.jpg)

Jaffna Monitor

24
to an abrupt end in 1994 when he was arrested. 
However, he was released in 2001 during the 
ceasefire period.
Remarkably, despite his past capture, Nimalan 
was once again sent back to Colombo on 
clandestine assignments under orders from 
LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman.
Sources shared with Jaffna Monitor that 
Nimalan's primary mission was to closely 
monitor Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs 
who had been handpicked and backed by the 
LTTE. During the time when the TNA held 
a formidable 22 seats in Parliament, it was 
Nimalan who kept a watchful eye on their 
movements, discreetly tracking their activities 
and loyalties. He reported their every move to 
LTTE leaders in Vanni.
Like Pugalenthi Master, Nimalan also managed 
to escape from Aasikulam, navigating through 
Mannar and eventually reaching India by boat. 
Using his contacts at TamilNet, he successfully 
made his way to Germany as early as 2012. 
Credible evidence obtained by Jaffna Monitor 
suggests that, once settled in Germany, 
Nimalan began reaching out to his former 
intelligence wing comrades during 2012 and 
2013—many of whom had surrendered and 
undergone rehabilitation. Calling from a 
German number, he attempted to rally support 
for a new venture. However, his efforts proved 
unsuccessful, failing to win over any of his 
former associates.
Now residing in Germany, Nimalan has 
emerged as one of the central figures among 
the remnants of the LTTE's intelligence wing. 
A former LTTE intelligence operative, both 
amused and bitter, confided to Jaffna Monitor: 
"The intelligence leaders who abandoned 
Nimalan lighting an oil lamp at a pro-LTTE event in Germany, 2013.

fighters in Sri Lanka and escaped like cowards 
have regrouped in Europe, now establishing 
a shadow LTTE intelligence network." 
Questioning their motives, he added, "It's likely 
they're either busy collecting money from 
the diaspora or simply making unnecessary 
noise—like the Tamil proverb says, 'wearing 
silangai at the waist during intimate 
moments.'" He implied that these former 
intelligence leaders, who failed to act when 
it mattered most, are now making irrelevant 
noises without meaningful action, much like 
the misplaced clang of silangai.
At the helm of this new network is Thennavan, 
a former LTTE intelligence leader known 
for his skill in smuggling banned goods into 
LTTE-controlled areas, often by bribing Sri 
Lankan officials. With the recent passing of 
Vinayagam—the de facto leader of the LTTE 
intelligence remnants in Europe—Thennavan 
has been steadily positioning himself to 
assume this influential role.
One LTTE intelligence source recounted a 
memorable instance involving Pottu Amman, 
who, with evident pride, once instructed him 
to look down at his feet. Sporting a pair of 
Adidas shoes, Pottu Amman explained that 
they were a gift from Thennavan. Smiling, he 
then held up a sleek coffee cup, announcing 
with satisfaction that it, too, had been gifted by 
Thennavan. The source who narrated this story 
remarked, "This scenario might give you some 
insight into where exactly our struggle went 
wrong."
