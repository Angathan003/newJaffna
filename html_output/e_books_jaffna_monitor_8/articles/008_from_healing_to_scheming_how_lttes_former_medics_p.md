redible sources close to Achchuthan 
disclosed to Jaffna Monitor that much of 
his current team consists of former members 
from the LTTE's medical unit. While leaders 
and fighters from other factions have grown 
disillusioned with him, many within the 
former medical team remain loyal to his 
operations, largely due to the influence of 
his wife, Sakalya (known by her LTTE alias, 
Rathika). A former LTTE Medical College 
second-batch student and doctor herself, 
Sakalya, along with her former superior, 
Dr. Vaman—an ex-LTTE physician now 
based in the UK—has been instrumental in 
rallying former LTTE medical personnel into 
Achchuthan's intricate web of deception.

Another prominent figure 
within Achchuthan's network is 
Kenga (also known as Pathma), 
the widow of the late Colonel 
Nagesh, who died heroically in 
the Battle of Aanandapuram. 
Originally from Kodikamam 
in Jaffna, Kenga served with 
the LTTE's medical team in 
Batticaloa, where she met and 
married Nagesh, a commander 
from the East. Now residing 
in Switzerland, Kenga plays 
a crucial role in coordinating 
Achchuthan's operations in 
the Eastern region, leveraging 
her connections with former 
fighters from the area to expand 
his influence. A credible source 
confirmed to Jaffna Monitor that 
her reach within Achchuthan's 
network is substantial.

first suicide bombing within an army camp. On 09.08.1999, he entered the Vakarai 
military camp under the guise of collecting weekly food relief and detonated a 
bomb strapped to his body, killing Major T. G. J. B. Karunanayake, the second-in-
command of an infantry battalion.
