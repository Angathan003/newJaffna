T
he escalating tariff war between the 
United States and China has reached 
unprecedented levels, with the U.S. imposing 
tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports 
and China retaliating with 125% tariffs on 
American goods. This intensification of trade 
tensions has introduced significant uncertainty 
into the global economy. For countries like Sri 
Lanka — already grappling with the aftermath 
of its 2022 sovereign debt default — the impact 
could be particularly severe, especially with 
Washington’s proposed 70% tax on certain 
Sri Lankan exports under its revised trade 
preferences.
To gain deeper insights into the broader 
implications of this trade conflict and its 
specific impact on Sri Lanka, we turned to 
Dr. Cai Tongjuan, Director of the Macro 
Research Department and Research Fellow at 
the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, 
Renmin University of China. As a Chinese 
economist with extensive expertise in both 
China's global trade strategies and Sri Lanka's 
economic landscape, Dr. Cai offers a uniquely 
informed perspective on how the U.S.-China 
trade tensions might shape Sri Lanka's 
economic future.
This is our exclusive conversation with her.
With the U.S. recently escalating 
tariffs on Chinese imports to 245%, 
and China retaliating with 125% tariffs 
on U.S. goods, how do you assess the 
current phase of the U.S.–China trade 
war? What distinguishes this phase 
from previous trade tensions?
With U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods raised 
to 245% and China’s tariffs on U.S. goods 
reaching 125%, the China–U.S. trade war has 
evolved beyond a mere tariff dispute into a 
broader contest of economic resilience and 
national strength.
The first phase of the trade war, beginning in 
2018, was driven by U.S. efforts to address its 
trade deficit with China. Under the banners of 
“unfair trade practices,” “market distortions,” 
and “forced technology transfers,” Washington 
adopted a strategy of “limited tariffs + entity 
lists,” coupled with the “small yard, high 
fence” doctrine. This intensified investment 
restrictions, supply chain scrutiny, financial 
pressure, and alliance-building efforts (such as 
the semiconductor or "chip" alliance), aiming 
to contain China’s high-tech industries and 
achieve technological decoupling.
In the current phase, successive U.S. 
administrations, starting with Trump, have 
sought broader decoupling by imposing 
sweeping tariffs and blocking re-export trade. 
The aim is not merely revenue generation, 
but accelerating China’s exclusion from global 
supply and industrial chains. As a result, the 
conflict has expanded beyond economics into 
a long-term strategic rivalry, fragmenting the 
global economic and trade system.
Unlike the relatively swift Phase One trade 
deal, resolving the current phase will be far 
more difficult. This is no longer a traditional 
trade dispute but a full-spectrum strategic 
competition—spanning geopolitics, security, 
cultural influence, and public discourse. 
In this environment, developing countries 
are increasingly being forced to take sides, 
accelerating the bifurcation of global supply 
chains into a dual-track system.
The U.S. President has repeatedly 
claimed that China imposes 
significantly higher tariffs on American 
goods than the U.S. does on Chinese

products and that this imbalance 
justifies the current wave of U.S. 
tariff hikes. From your expert point of 
view, is there any factual or economic 
justification for this claim? How do 
China's tariff policies actually work in 
practice—especially in comparison 
to the U.S.? Could you help clarify the 
real dynamics behind these competing 
tax regimes?
This is factually misleading and economically 
flawed.
Before the 2018 trade war, U.S. tariffs on 
Chinese goods averaged 3.1%, while Chinese 
tariffs on U.S. goods averaged 8%. By early 
2020, after escalating tensions, U.S. tariffs 
on Chinese imports rose to about 20%, and 
Chinese tariffs to around 21.1%—a minor 
difference that hardly justifies recent U.S. 
tariff hikes of up to 245% on certain Chinese 
products.
The U.S. administration's latest justification—a 
“reciprocal tariff calculation” based on 
dividing the bilateral trade deficit (USD 
295.4 billion) by total imports from China 
(USD 438.9 billion) to yield a "deficit ratio" 
of 67.3%, then halving it to propose a 34% 
tariff—is widely criticized as simplistic and 
economically unsound.
China’s retaliation has been targeted and 
strategic, focusing on U.S. agricultural and 
energy exports, while U.S. tariffs primarily aim 
at high-tech sectors to curb China’s industrial 
growth. Economically, American consumers 
and businesses bear most of the tariff burden, 
while China has diversified its suppliers, 
minimizing the impact.
Ultimately, this dispute is less about tariff 
fairness and more about strategic competition. 
The U.S. seeks to restructure global supply 
chains and weaken China’s manufacturing 
dominance, while China counters through 
industrial self-reliance, de-dollarization 
efforts, and regional trade initiatives like 
RCEP. In this light, the "tariff imbalance" 
narrative serves political purposes rather than 
reflecting genuine economic reality.
Considering China’s strategic 
initiatives like the Belt and Road 
Initiative and its diversified trade 
partnerships, how resilient is China's 
economy to these heightened tariffs? 
Are there specific sectors or regions 
within China that are more vulnerable? 
China’s economy has demonstrated 
considerable resilience against high U.S. 
tariffs, supported by the Belt and Road 
Initiative and a diversified trading strategy.
The sectors most affected include machinery 
and equipment, electronics, textiles, and 
metal products—industries with high U.S. 
export exposure and vulnerability to tariff 
fluctuations. However, on April 11, the U.S. 
government quietly exempted several key 
electronic products—including smartphones, 
laptops, hard drives, processors, chips, and 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment—
from Trump-era reciprocal tariffs, even if 
sourced from China.
Regionally, coastal provinces such as Zhejiang, 
Guangdong, and Jiangsu have been more 
heavily impacted due to their higher reliance 
on U.S. markets. For instance, Zhejiang’s 
export dependence on the U.S. stood at 16.2% 
in 2024.

Nevertheless, China has actively worked to 
cushion the impact by strengthening trade ties 
with ASEAN, the EU, and other regions, while 
promoting industrial upgrading and boosting 
domestic demand.
The U.S. has exempted certain 
electronics, such as smartphones and 
computers, from the new tariffs. What 
does this selective exemption indicate 
about the U.S.'s strategic economic 
interests, and how might China 
interpret this move?
Tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers, 
and other electronic imports reflects the 
duality of its strategic economic interests. 
On the one hand, those products are highly 
dependent on China’s supply chain, and if 
high tariffs are imposed, it will directly drive 
up the price of U.S. consumer electronics, 
exacerbate inflationary pressures, harm the 
interests of technology titans, and spark 
voter dissatisfaction, so the exemption is a 
compromise in consideration of short-term 
economic realities. On the other hand, the 
U.S. is still attempting to maintain its long-
term strategy of technological containment of 
China through selective exemptions, retaining 
the 20% basic tariffs and planning to impose 
“national security reviews” on key areas such 
as semiconductors. such duality shows it 
intends to ease the economic impact while 
not giving up suppressing China's high-tech 
industry. 
China may interpret this move as a U.S. 
swing between supply chain dependence and 
political objectives, a disguised recognition 
of China's manufacturing advantage yet also 
an exposure of the ambivalence of the U.S. 
trade policy. China may see this as a tactical 
concession rather than a strategic shift and 
may use this window to strengthen the 
resilience of its industrial chain while keeping 
a wary eye on the U.S. for a new round of 
pressure on the grounds of “technological 
security” in the future.
China's Ministry of Commerce has responded 
that there is “no winner” in a tariff war, urging 
the U.S. side to completely abolish the wrong 
practices, indicating that China will not relax 
its guard against the repetitive nature of U.S. 
policies due to partial exemptions.
In your view, how are the escalating 
U.S.–China trade tensions influencing 
global trade dynamics, particularly 
for developing countries? Are we 
witnessing a shift towards regional 
trade blocs or alternative trade 
alliances?
Firstly, the high tariffs imposed by both the US 
and China have driven up supply chain costs 
globally, leading to higher prices for consumer 
goods.
According to the International Trade Centre 
(ITC), these tariffs could shrink global trade 
by 3% to 7% and reduce global GDP by as 
much as 0.7%. Developing countries would 
bear the brunt of this impact. For instance, 
Bangladesh, a major clothing exporter, could 
see its exports to the US drop by $3.3 billion 
by 2029 if these tariffs remain in place. Other 
countries like Lesotho, Cambodia, Laos, 
Madagascar, and Myanmar are facing similar 
pressures, and the disruptions to global supply 
chains could erase the economic progress 
they’ve made in recent years.
Secondly, China’s exports to the US are now 
facing much higher effective tax rates. That

has created short-term downward pressure, 
forcing industries to shift their focus toward 
domestic sales. Labor-intensive industries 
such as electronics and textiles are also directly 
impacted. Companies that heavily rely on 
Chinese supply chains are now facing double 
pressure from reduced orders and rising costs.
Furthermore, this trade conflict may trigger a 
profound restructuring of global value chains. 
To avoid tariff costs, many companies are 
forced to relocate their production facilities 
from China to places like Southeast Asia, 
India, or Mexico. This realignment is making 
global manufacturing even more unstable.
At the same time, the rise of regional trade 
blocs and alternative trade alliances has 
become a key trend in the global trade 
landscape. To address the uncertainty caused 
by US-China trade tensions, countries are 
seeking new trade partners and cooperation 
models. For example, China is actively 
strengthening ties with emerging markets 
like ASEAN and Latin America through 
agreements like the Regional Comprehensive

Economic Partnership (RCEP) to diversify 
market risks. Meanwhile, the US is promoting 
a strategy to bring manufacturing back to 
its home soil by encouraging investments in 
domestic production. These trends indicate 
that the global trade landscape is evolving 
from a single, large-loop system to multiple 
smaller-loop systems centered around regions 
or trade blocs. The emergence of regional 
trade blocs and alternative trade alliances has 
become a critical strategy for addressing trade 
protectionism.
The U.S. has imposed a 44% tariff 
on Sri Lankan exports, significantly 
affecting its apparel industry. How do 
you interpret this move in the context 
of U.S. trade policy, and what might be 
the underlying motivations?
This action can be analyzed through three 
main objectives: reducing the trade deficit, 
increasing fiscal revenue, and promoting the 
re-shoring of manufacturing.
First, reducing the trade deficit.
In 2024, the U.S. trade deficit reached $918.4 
billion. The Trump administration attributed 
much of this imbalance to “unfair trade 
practices” and sought to pressure trading 
partners by imposing tariffs. For instance, in 
2024, total merchandise trade between the U.S. 
and Sri Lanka amounted to approximately $3.4 
billion, with the U.S. importing $3.03 billion 
in goods from Sri Lanka while exporting only 
$370 million. This resulted in a bilateral trade 
deficit of $2.66 billion for the U.S.
The 44% tariff was calculated by dividing the 
trade deficit by U.S. imports and multiplying 
by two. By imposing this tariff—targeting 
primarily Sri Lanka’s key export sector, 
apparel—the U.S. aimed to force Sri Lanka 
to adjust its trade structure and reduce its 
surplus.
Second, increasing government 
revenue.
With U.S. federal debt surpassing $36.4 trillion 
and interest payments accounting for 3.1% 
of GDP, the government faces mounting 
fiscal pressure. The Trump administration 
estimated that higher tariffs on trade partners 
such as Sri Lanka could generate between 
$300 billion and $600 billion annually. A 
portion of this would be used to meet interest 
obligations on the national debt. By framing 
tariffs as a "direct tax" on foreign goods, the 
administration sought to enhance political 
acceptability—effectively shifting the burden 
away from domestic taxpayers and onto 
external trading partners.
Third, promoting the re-shoring of 
manufacturing.
The Trump administration has mandated 
that multinational corporations achieve a 
"domesticization rate" of over 60% for key 
industries by 2028. High tariffs are being 
used as a tool to weaken the attractiveness 
of overseas supply chains. In the case of Sri 
Lanka, apparel products made up more than 
70% of its $3.03 billion exports to the U.S. 
last year. The imposition of a 44% tariff will 
significantly erode profit margins, potentially 
leading to the loss of an estimated 710,000 
jobs. This disruption is intended to incentivize 
industries to either relocate to regions 
with lower tariffs or return manufacturing 
operations to the U.S.
Additionally, this strategy aligns with the 
broader “America First” agenda—seeking to

reconstruct a U.S.-centered 
global supply chain and curb 
the industrial advancement 
of competitors like China.
Given Sri Lanka's 
economic 
vulnerabilities and 
its ongoing recovery 
efforts, what immediate 
and long-term 
measures would you 
recommend for the 
country to mitigate the 
adverse effects of these 
tariffs?
Sri Lanka's core problem 
is its over-reliance on the 
United States as a single 
market: the United States 
has always been Sri Lanka's 
most important export 
destination, and exports to 
the United States account 
for 23% of Sri Lanka's total 
commodity exports in 2024. 
In 2024, Sri Lanka's trade 
deficit expanded to US$6.07 
billion, and the trade surplus 
with the United States 
(US$2.66 billion) is an 
important source of foreign 
exchange income for the 
country.
In the short term, Sri Lanka 
cannot temporarily reverse 
its trade dependence on 
the United States. As a 
small country, it is unable 
to confront the United States and can only seek compromise 
and negotiate with the US government to reduce or delay 
the imposition of tariffs. In the long run, as a developing 
country, Sri Lanka will inevitably maintain a trade surplus 
in manufacturing industries such as clothing to promote 
economic growth by developing export-oriented and labor-
intensive industries. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce 
dependence on a single market and promote the diversification 
of export markets to promote balanced trade development.

Do you see the potential for Sri Lanka 
to strengthen its trade relations with 
China or other regional partners as 
a counterbalance to the challenges 
posed by U.S. trade policies? What 
opportunities and risks might this 
entail?
Sri Lanka is expected to ease the impact of 
the US tariff policy and achieve sustainable 
growth in the regional economic landscape by 
deepening economic and trade cooperation 
with China and regional partners, taking 
the Belt and Road Initiative as a framework, 
balancing cooperation with China and 
multilateral partners, and enhancing 
endogenous driving forces through 
technological upgrading and industrial 
diversification. However, it is necessary to 
carefully balance opportunities and risks.
As for Opportunities. First is the big potential 
of the Chinese market. As Sri Lanka's second-
largest trading partner, China's bilateral 
trade volume reached US$3.81 billion in 
2024, and China promised to further reduce 
tariff barriers through free trade agreement 
negotiations. Sri Lanka's specialty products 
such as Ceylon black tea and gemstones 
have differentiated competitiveness in the 
Chinese market. With the help of cross-border 
e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, the 
export share to China can be expanded.
Second is the regional supply chain 
integration. Sri Lanka participates in China's 
Belt and Road initiative. The infrastructure 
projects such as Hambantota Port and 
Colombo Port City have enhanced its status as 
a regional logistics hub. By signing free trade 
agreements with India and ASEAN, Sri Lanka 
can build a diversified supply chain and avoid 
dependence on a single market.
Third is industrial cooperation upgrades. 
China's investment in Sri Lanka in textiles, 
new energy and other fields, if extended 
to high value-added industries (such as 
information technology), can enhance its 
position in the industrial chain.
As for Risks. One is geopolitical maneuvering. 
The United States has included Sri Lanka in 
the framework of the “Indo-Pacific Strategy”, 
and Sri Lanka’s cooperation with China may 
trigger pressure from the United States. For 
example, the Hambantota Port project in Sri 
Lanka was once questioned by the United 
States as a "Chinese military base".
Second is the fragility of the economic 
structure. Sri Lanka has a weak industrial 
base and a single industrial structure. As of 
the third quarter of 2024, the manufacturing 
sector was estimated to account for only 27.5% 
of GDP. Among its industries, the textile and 
apparel sector dominated, contributing over 
60% of the total manufacturing output. At the 
same time, Sri Lanka's manufacturing industry 
is more dependent on foreign investment.
Third is the intensified regional competition. 
If participating in regional economic 
cooperation, Sri Lanka will be less competitive 
than other economic partners, and vulnerable 
industries are likely to be impacted. A 
longer period of industrial protection will be 
required. India offers a zero-tariff policy for Sri 
Lanka's textile industry, while countries like 
Vietnam are also competing for a share of low- 
to mid-end manufacturing. Sri Lanka needs to 
find its strategic position within the regional 
industrial chain.
