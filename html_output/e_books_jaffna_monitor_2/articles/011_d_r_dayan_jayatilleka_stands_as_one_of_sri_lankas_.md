D
r. Dayan Jayatilleka stands as one of Sri 
Lanka’s preeminent public intellectuals, 
diplomats, and political theorists.
A former revolutionary — and notably, a 
Sinhalese among the earliest members of the 
Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front 
(EPRLF) in the late 1970s — he epitomizes 
the early inclusive ethos of Tamil militancy. 
His political trajectory mirrors the complexity 
of Sri Lanka’s modern history, evolving from 
militant activism to a principled commitment 
to democratic pluralism.
An accomplished academic and prolific 
author, Dr. Jayatilleka’s oeuvre includes The 
Travails of a Democracy, Fidel’s Ethics of 
Violence, Long War, Cold Peace, The Fall of 
Global Socialism, and his latest, Interventions: 
Selected Political Writings (2024).
In diplomacy, he distinguished himself 
as Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary to Russia (2018–2020) and 
earlier held ambassadorial appointments in 
France (also accredited to Spain and Portugal) 
and at the United Nations Office in Geneva 
(2007–2009).
This is our exclusive conversation with him.
In a recent interview with a Sinhala-
language news outlet, you reportedly 
remarked that President Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake is “behaving 
more like a Chief Minister of an Indian 
state than the head of a sovereign 
nation.” What prompted you to make 
that comparison? In your view, is his 
government undermining Sri Lanka’s 
sovereignty?
Anura’s JVP comrade and the Chief 
Government Whip in Parliament stated at a 
media briefing that his government cannot—
and will not—disclose the contents of the 
MoUs signed with Prime Minister Modi 
without the concurrence of the Government 
of India. If true, this implies that India holds 
a veto over whether or not agreements signed 
on Sri Lankan soil, concerning Sri Lanka’s 
bilateral relationship with its neighbour and 
signed by Sri Lanka’s President—elected by the 
Sri Lankan people—can be made public.
No Sri Lankan government since 
independence in 1948 has ever made such 
a declaration. Does this suggest that Sri 
Lanka, its President, and its Government 
are now effectively governed from India? 
This is certainly not the stance or rhetoric 
of a sovereign and independent nation. It 
resembles, instead, the posture of a Chief 
Minister of an Indian state. As the saying goes, 
“If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and 
quacks like a duck—it is a duck".
You’ve accused India of 
"compromising the interests of Sri 
Lankan Tamils" in its recent dealings 
with Colombo. Could you elaborate 
on this statement? How, in your view, 
has New Delhi failed to uphold its 
traditional role as a guarantor of Tamil 
rights?
There was no reference to the 13th 
Amendment or Provincial Councils in any 
text. The only reference was verbal and non-
specific, in Prime Minister Modi’s remarks, 
which referred to the implementation of the 
Sri Lankan Constitution including elections to 
Provincial Councils.

This is a huge contrast with the Indo-Lanka 
accord of 1987 where the crux of the matter 
was devolution. The strategic issues were in 
the Annexures and exchange of letters. Today 
there is a complete inversion.
What was in the Annexures and Exchange 
of letters form the core of the Modi-AKD 
agreements, while devolution has disappeared. 
There is no written commitment by the 
Sri Lankan government to anything with 
regard to Tamil autonomy. 40 years of policy 
discourse starting from Annexure C (1984) 
and the Delhi agreements signed by Harry 
Jayewardene, agreeing to the Province as the 
main unit of devolution, have evaporated.
This is more the fault of the Tamil political 
class than of India, though. As Joni Mitchell 
sang, “Don’t it always seem to go, that you 
don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”
You publicly criticized the recent 
defence cooperation agreement signed 
during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to 
Colombo—an agreement many saw 
as a diplomatic milestone. Why do 
you view it as a potential threat to 
Sri Lanka’s sovereignty or regional 
neutrality? What long-term concerns 
does it raise for you?
There are two sources for my suspicions-
indeed, my objections. Firstly, the 
unprecedented and obdurate secrecy on the 
part of the Anura Dissanayake administration. 
Why? What is it hiding? What is it so afraid 
of? Logically, it can’t be anything good or 
acceptable to the Sri Lankan people.
Secondly, the leaks in the Indian media—both 
print and electronic—which refer to a “first-
ever defence pact,” a “defence alliance,” and to 
Trincomalee as an “energy hub.” Sri Lanka has 
never had a defence pact or alliance with any 
country—until now. Why should we entangle 
ourselves in such a relationship at a time when 
India is part of the Quad with the USA; when 
the USA considers China a ‘peer adversary’ 
and is in a trade war with it; and when China’s 
prestige is rising across Asia, in part due to 
Trump’s behaviour? Why should Sri Lanka 
align itself with one side over the other?
How would you assess the 
performance of the current 
government led by the National 
People's Power (NPP)? Have they 
delivered on their electoral promises? 
And as someone who once identified 
with the Left, do you believe they 
remain ideologically consistent?
I have always identified myself to this day as 
on the Left, of the Left, (coming) from the 
Left. But after the 1980s ended, I’ve not been 
identified with a particular Left because I’ve 
found that far too self-limiting.
The current NPP Government has not 
only failed to deliver on its most important 
promises-it has actively reneged on them, 
embracing the very policies it had vehemently 
opposed over the past few years, including 
during its 2024 election campaign. On the 
IMF agreement and the debt deal with 
private creditors, it didn’t even attempt to 
renegotiate, but instead rushed to continue 
the arrangements made by President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe with the IMF, and agreed 
to in principle by him with the private 
creditors. These agreements had been publicly 
denounced by Anura Dissanayake during his 
presidential campaign.

What is most emblematic of the character 
of his administration is the unprecedented 
appointment of the current Chairman of the 
Ceylon Chamber of Commerce as one of two 
senior economic advisors to the President 
and as a key negotiator with both the private 
bondholders and the IMF.
No serious country—let alone a self-
proclaimed progressive—would appoint the 
head of its top business chamber as senior 
economic advisor, especially to negotiate 
sovereign debt.
It is a blatant conflict of interest. The Ceylon 
Chamber of Commerce includes major ISB 
holders, and ISB debt lies at the heart of Sri 
Lanka’s crisis. In effect, a local bondholder is 
negotiating with foreign bondholders. Whose 
interests will prevail—the citizens’ or the 
creditors’?
This move exposes the class interests 
underpinning the Anura Kumara Dissanayake 
presidency—not just its composition, but its 
character.
As for India, JVP-NPP leader Anura 
Dissanayake has enthusiastically signed 
agreements with Prime Minister Modi—
agreements he had fiercely criticized in his 
2023 speeches to the Veterans Collective when 
they appeared in the Joint Statement following 
Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to India.
There is nothing remotely left-wing, 
centre-left, or even centrist about the AKD 
administration. It has executed a 180-degree 
shift—from a centre-left opposition to 
arguably the most right-wing administration 
Sri Lanka has seen.
You’ve long framed politics through a Left vs. 
Right lens. But in a context where so-called 
Leftist parties form alliances with capitalist 
elites and flirt with nationalist rhetoric, does 
that ideological binary still hold any relevance?
No, I’ve never framed politics as a binary 
of Right vs Left. If I had, how could I have 
worked so closely with Presidents Premadasa 
and Mahinda Rajapaksa? Populism doesn’t 
fit neatly into Right/Left binaries—nor does 
statism. Not everything can be reduced to 
Right vs Left. I’ve always acknowledged the 
existence of the Left, Right, Centre, Centre-
Left, and Centre-Right.
In terms of policy content, strategic 
orientation, and political discourse, today’s 
JVP-NPP is clearly on the Right. Let alone 
Centre-Left—even a Centre-Right leader 
would never have dared to appoint the 
Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce as an 
advisor and negotiator, and then proceed to 
sign seven agreements, including on defence, 
with India while refusing to disclose their 
contents.

You have, in the past, characterized 
the JVP as a Sinhala-extremist force 
that obstructed ethnic reconciliation. 
Could you elaborate on this with 
historical context? And how do 
you view the JVP today under the 
NPP banner, especially given its 
unexpected success in Tamil-majority 
areas? Has the party genuinely 
transformed?
The JVP leader Wijeweera’s book on the 
Tamil Eelam question was published in 1986, 
a year before the Indo-Lanka Accord. In it, 
he denounced every form of devolution, 
including the District Development Councils, 
which his party had contested in 1981. The 
JVP murdered student leader Daya Pathirana 
in December 1986—well before the Indo-
Lanka Accord. That incident stands as 
evidence of the JVP’s chauvinist past.
As for the present, the JVP is definitely not a 
Sinhala extremist party. That is partly because 
Wimal Weerawansa, the main exponent of 
radical Sinhala nationalism, quit the party. 
Additionally, the radical left breakaway 
faction—the Frontline Socialist Party, led by 
Kumar Gunaratnam—offered a strong critique 
of the JVP’s chauvinism, both internally 
and from the outside. Most significantly, the 
ideology of the Aragalaya, which the JVP 
did not lead, dealt a major blow to Sinhala 
chauvinism.
But the JVP-NPP has yet to face the real test. 
That test is: What is its political solution to the 
Tamil national question or the ethnonational 
question? The JVP still does not acknowledge 
that such a question exists.
It continues to reduce everything to 
socioeconomic and developmental 
dimensions. While there is some recognition 
of the need for a degree of provincial-level 
autonomy within a unitary framework, 
the JVP’s continued opposition to the 13th 
Amendment does not appear to stem from the 
belief that it is inadequate. On the contrary, 
the critique of the 13th Amendment seems to 
come from an outright anti-autonomy, anti-
devolution, conservative perspective.   
You’ve long argued that reconciliation 
must stem from domestic reform, 
rejecting Western calls for 
international accountability to 
protect sovereignty. Yet, 15 years 
after the war, devolution is stalled, 
the military remains entrenched in 
the North and East, and domestic 
justice mechanisms have failed. Has 
sustained inaction eroded Sri Lanka’s 
moral and institutional credibility to 
conduct its own inquiries—and doesn’t 
continued resistance to international 
involvement now risk obstructing 
justice and lasting reconciliation?
As a political scientist, I tend to adopt a 
comparative political studies perspective. I 
know of no functioning democratic state, 
headed by a democratically elected civilian 
government, which fought a civil war against 
a secessionist-terrorist movement—within its 
own internationally recognized borders—and 
won a decisive military victory, that has then 
submitted itself to international accountability 
processes or even a truth and reconciliation 
process.
As we know, the Good Friday Accords (the 
1998 peace agreement that ended three

decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, 
focusing on political compromise rather than 
legal accountability for past violence) had no 
such accountability component. Any such 
effort by a government is likely to be socially 
polarizing and politically destabilizing. I firmly 
believe that prosecution by Sri Lankan courts 
of emblematic cases—as recommended by the 
LLRC Report of 2011, which identified over 
10 incidents requiring investigation—remains 
the only viable path forward. That is as far as 
one can realistically go, on the ground, in Sri 
Lanka.
I wouldn’t recommend that the JVP-NPP 
pursue anything more ambitious, as it would 
likely provoke a resurgence of the Sinhala Far 
Right. Moreover, it has always been a zero-sum 
game between accountability and autonomy. 
Sinn Féin and the IRA wisely chose the latter.
You once defended Tamil militancy 
as a national liberation struggle. In 
retrospect, how do you view that 
stance now? Where did the LTTE and 
broader Tamil militant movements 
go wrong—politically, morally, and 
strategically?
Tamil militancy was definitely a national 
liberation struggle—or predominantly so-in 
its first decade. I agree with both M. Narayan 
Swamy and LTTE co-founder Raghavan, who, 
independently of each other, identify 1984 as 
the watershed year when that began to change. 
I would argue that with the Naiyaru, Kokilai, 
Dollar Farm, Kent Farm, and Anuradhapura 
massacres, as well as the slaughter of TELO 
and EPRLF members in 1986, the character 
of the struggle changed qualitatively, and its 
fascist tendencies came to the fore.
Where the LTTE went wrong has been best 
detailed by Raghavan in Jaffna Monitor and 
before that by Nithiyanandan, who was the 
first to expose Prabhakaran’s admiration for 
both Hitler and Zionism. The only chance 
the LTTE had for a different trajectory would 
have been if the leadership and political line of 
Mahattaya had prevailed over Prabhakaran’s-
but I don’t believe that was ever a viable 
prospect.
As for the other Tamil movements, their 
fatal mistake was that-even as they came to 
understand the nature of the LTTE-they failed 
to form a united front of the left-oriented 
Tamil organizations. Had the EPRLF and 
PLOTE done so, or better still, had PLOTE, 
EPRLF, EROS, NLFT, and PLFT united, 
history might have taken a far better turn.

There were also fundamental political reasons 
behind the tragedy that followed. No Tamil 
organization showed the realism of Sinn Féin/
IRA in recognizing that the 13th Amendment 
within a unitary state was the maximum 
achievable at that historical juncture. They 
never even attempted to make the 13th 
Amendment work. While Premadasa’s 
government was engaged in a war to preserve 
the democratic state, Vardarajaperumal 
was escalating his demands and issuing 
ultimatums—moves that simply could not be 
accommodated given the precarious situation 
in the South.
A larger, often overlooked issue must also be 
acknowledged: in no other country would 
the population have supported a war against 
foreign peacekeepers deployed with the 
consent of their own government.
Imagine, for instance, if Russian speakers in 
Crimea and the Donbass had fought against 
Russian forces! Even today, the Tamil diaspora 
has not fully recognized that fighting the 
Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was the 
LTTE’s ultimate blunder.
The Tamil nationalist movement has yet to 
come to terms with the limitations of its own 
slogans. Consider the once-mighty Kurds of 
Syria, or the trajectories of the Basque and 
Catalan struggles. At this moment, there is 
only one practical move left for the Tamil 
struggle: not to push for a solution beyond 
the 13th Amendment, but to first demand the 
holding of elections to the existing Provincial 
Councils. Sometimes, when you have got 
so many things so wrong for so long, you 
must start with what you have because if you 
don’t, you may lose that too. Democracy is 
the answer—in the form of elections to the 
existing provincial Councils. That may be 
the only way of saving any kind of large-unit 
devolution.
During your diplomatic service under 
President Mahinda Rajapaksa, you 
staunchly defended Sri Lanka’s human 
rights record. In hindsight, with 
mounting evidence and testimonies 
of wartime atrocities, do you believe 
you helped shield the regime from 
legitimate international scrutiny?
If I had to do it all over again, I believe I 
would—though perhaps not in every tactical 
detail. Whether then or now, I was never going 
to allow the diplomatic victory of a secessionist 
movement with a fascist terrorist character, or 
of Western imperialist powers hypocritically 
calling for international inquiries.
Now, as then, I believe that a basically just war 
was waged by a fundamentally democratic 
state. Long before Geneva, I opposed any 
attempt to appease the Tigers; I never believed 
a negotiated solution was possible with a 
movement that had assassinated Nehru’s 
grandson. I firmly believed that a military 
victory over the LTTE was both desirable and 
achievable.
Then, as now, I support the kind of political 
solution envisioned in the Bandaranaike-
Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957, and in the 
various rounds of negotiations held between 
1984 and 1986.
On what basis did you believe that 
a military victory over the LTTE was 
achievable? And did you factor in the 
thousands of lives—mainly Tamil—
that were lost during that pursuit, at 
the hands of both the military and the 
LTTE?

I went on record arguing at length that 
Prabhakaran could be militarily defeated, 
though the Tamil Question had to be 
politically resolved. This was in a detailed 
interview that D.P. Sivaram, a.k.a. Taraki—my 
late friend—conducted with me for the North-
Eastern Herald, which he edited (before J. 
Tissanayagam), in late 1992. He published it 
with a title featuring a provocative line from 
my interview: "Premadasa should be a little 
more of a war-monger."
Then again, in 2004—well before Mahinda 
Rajapaksa was elected President—I wrote a 
piece in The Island, or perhaps the Sunday 
Island, titled "Why Prabhakaran Will Lose."
I stuck my neck out and risked my credibility 
in both instances. As Godfrey Gunatilleke 
writes in his three-volume autobiography, 
mine was a lone voice—not even the entire 
military brass, or most of it, shared my view. 
But history proved me right.
Why was I so sure?
Because Prabhakaran had violated all the 
rules and norms of People’s War, and could 
not possibly win in the long run. He had 
read extensively on conventional warfare but 
ignored People’s War and the great minds who 
theorized and fought such wars.
As for the massive casualties, they were the 
direct outcome of Prabhakaran’s refusal to 
arrive at a negotiated settlement short of Tamil 
Eelam, even when he held the upper hand—as 
in 2003. They were also the consequence of 
Ranil Wickremesinghe’s decision to call off 
a Special Forces ambush on Prabhakaran in 
December 2001, which could have decapitated 
the LTTE and shortened the war.
In 1981, while I was a doctoral student in the 
U.S., I wrote an article for the Lanka Guardian, 
which was later translated and published in 
Viduthalai Puligal, the organ of the LTTE. 
It was titled "Individual Terrorism or Urban 
Guerrilla War?" and argued that the armed 
actions underway in Jaffna at the time—

47
which did not involve attacks on unarmed 
civilian "soft targets"—could not be classified 
as terrorism, but rather as urban guerrilla 
warfare. However, my critique of the LTTE, 
and my warning of possible failure, began even 
before the massacres of late 1983–1984.
In 1982 or 1983, I delivered a lecture at Jaffna 
University at the invitation of Marumalarchik 
Kalaham—the Renaissance Society—which 
was unofficially affiliated with the LTTE. The 
topic was The Lessons of the Nicaraguan 
Revolution. My translator on that occasion 
was D.P. Sivaram.
At one moment during the interpretation, 
Sivaram paused and made it clear that he was 
merely translating my words, not expressing 
his own views. That was when I criticized 
the dismembering of a policeman and the 
public display of his severed limbs. Among 
the audience were LTTE youth, including 
some who had participated in the raid on the 
Chavakachcheri Police Station. Vardarajah 
Perumal was still on the university staff, and 
we met later for a chat in the staff room.
In that lecture, I warned that if the iron 
rules of People’s War—as exemplified by the 
Nicaraguan Revolution—were not adhered 
to, the struggle would eventually fail. Some 
elements in the Renaissance Society were 
impressed by my argument and translated the 
lecture into Tamil. I later learned that these 
elements were close to Mahattaya, the LTTE’s 
main link with the university. The translation 
was published as a pamphlet. Tragically, the 
young student leader carrying the pamphlet on 
a motorcycle was shot at an Army checkpoint, 
and his colleague swallowed cyanide. The text 
was lost for some years.
Later, during the period I was underground, 
Rajani Thiranagama brought me a copy of the 
translated pamphlet that Mahattaya had given 
her for me. I believe this was in 1986.
My point is this: I had not only cautioned 
about the likelihood of failure if the norms of 
People’s War continued to be violated—I had 
done so before a para-LTTE audience, in Jaffna 
University itself. Furthermore, my warning 
had sufficient resonance for an element within 
or linked to the LTTE to have it published 
in translation. However, that progressive 
tendency was later eliminated by Prabhakaran. 
Had it survived, the entire history of the 
struggle might have been different.
But the deviations from People’s War were 
already very clear in the theory and practice of 
the LTTE even in the early 1980s. Chief among 
them were the rejection of united fronts 
and, most fatally, the violation of the ethical 
boundaries of violence that any successful 
guerrilla, national liberation, or revolutionary 
movement adheres to.
Thus, my prediction of the LTTE’s eventual 
defeat goes back not to 1992 or 2004, but to 
1982–1983.
You were part of Vikalpa Kandayama, 
a progressive collective formed after 
the 1983 pogrom, aimed at countering 
Sinhala nationalism and bridging the

ethnic divide. Can you reflect on the 
group’s goals, methods, and what 
legacy—if any—it left behind?
I would say I was more than just ‘part 
of the Vikalpa Kandayama’. When 23 
members of the group and its allies—
including K. Padmanabha, founder-leader 
of the EPRLF—were indicted in the High 
Court of Colombo on 14 counts under 
the Prevention of Terrorism Act and 
Emergency Regulations, starting with 
‘conspiracy to overthrow the state through 
violence’, I was named the First Accused.
The group was a revolutionary left 
organization with a Marxist-Leninist 
ideology and a multi-ethnic composition. 
It aimed at a socialist revolution in alliance 
with the Tamil Left. We had envisioned a 
North-South project based on a two-front 
struggle. We had identified the EPRLF as 
the most authentically leftist of the Tamil 
organizations—far more Marxist-Leninist than 
PLOTE.
As Suresh Premachandran can confirm, the 
initial discussions with me took place at 
Peradeniya University in 1978, when I was still 
a student and Padmanabha and Suresh were 
still members of EROS and its student wing, 
GUES (the General Union of Eelam Students). 
A few years after our first meeting in 1978, 
Padmanabha gave me the founding program 
of the EPRLF in 1981.
As for its legacy, I am glad to see that the 
idea of comradeship between Northern and 
Southern leftists—crossing the ethnic divide, 
for which we were murdered in the South by 
the JVP and our EPRLF comrades were killed 
in the North by the LTTE—is now a broadly 
shared idea. We now see it realized, both in 
the JVP-NPP to some extent, and more deeply 
in the FSP (Frontline Socialist Party) and the 
People’s Struggle Alliance (PSA).
You briefly served as a minister in the 
Northern Provincial Council through 
the EPRLF. Why was your tenure 
cut short? What were the internal 
or political dynamics behind your 
departure?
I had urged Padmanabha to become Chief 
Minister, but he stubbornly refused. Had 
he accepted the post, everything might 
have turned out differently. The Northeast 
Provincial Council (NEPC), the Tamil 
National Army (TNA militia), and the Chief 
Minister were manipulated by his advisors 
and external patrons in an attempt to outflank 
the LTTE on a Tamil Eelamist platform—by 
confronting the Sri Lankan state and armed 
forces, not to mention Sinhala villages.
The Sinhala South had already paid the price 
with the loss of hundreds of militants and 
leaders—such as Vijaya Kumaratunga—in 
defence of the 13th Amendment and the 
Provincial Councils. Yet here was the NEPC 
and  Varadaraja Perumal denouncing the

13th Amendment as inadequate, even before 
taking office and beginning to govern. The 
adventurist confrontationism of the NEPC-
TNA was aiding the JVP in polarizing the 
situation and destabilizing the state in the 
South.
I had to take a stand, choose a side—it was a 
bitter civil war in the South—and free myself 
to help defend the democratic state as well 
as the most progressive leader we had ever 
elected: Ranasinghe Premadasa, who came 
from a subaltern class-caste background. That’s 
what I did.
You describe Ranasinghe Premadasa 
as the most progressive leader 
we have ever elected. But history 
also records that, under his regime 
and reportedly with his blessings, 
thousands of Sinhala youth were 
killed. How then can you describe him 
as a progressive leader?
In the very first place, Premadasa’s election 
meant there was no legitimate reason to 
continue the armed struggle. As Che wrote 
in Guerrilla Warfare, if a government comes 
into power by a vote—fraudulent or not—a 
guerrilla uprising cannot be justified. The JVP 
should have ceased fighting and entered into 
negotiations.
Secondly, Premadasa insisted on the departure 
of the IPKF and implemented it even after 
Wijeweera was dead—demonstrating his 
sincerity. The JVP should have laid down their 
arms, since their primary demand was now 
being actively pursued by the newly elected 
president.
Thirdly, Premadasa declared a unilateral 
ceasefire, released 1,500 JVP detainees, 
invited them to attend the All-Parties 
Conference (which the LTTE’s political wing, 
the PFLT, attended—represented by Dilip 
Yogi), encouraged them to participate in the 
upcoming parliamentary election process, 
and even promised them three ministerial 
portfolios.
The JVP rejected all of it, and scornfully 
announced their rejection at a public meeting 
in Nugegoda in June 1989, before unilaterally 
returning to war.
Premadasa had no choice but to respond. 
All those who died after he was elected and 
extended an olive branch died needlessly—
because of the JVP’s obduracy. The same story 
repeated itself with the LTTE twenty years 
later.
Premadasa was progressive, firstly because he 
broke the caste-class ceiling and became the 
first Sri Lankan leader from a subaltern caste. 
Even Anura Dissanayake’s victory didn’t break 
that barrier. Premadasa’s ascent was the social 
equivalent of Barack Obama’s.
Secondly, Premadasa was progressive because 
of his policies. He was the only one of our 
leaders—and among the very few in the 
world—who simultaneously achieved growth 
and equity: growing the economy while 
transferring real income to the least wealthy. 
Amidst two civil wars, he implemented 
programs such as Janasaviya, provincial 
industrialization, housing, free school 
uniforms, and more. That’s why I call him the 
most progressive leader Sri Lanka has ever 
had—and one of the most progressive that 
South Asia and the Global South have ever 
produced.
His main mistake was not going all out against 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE. He misread 
them—viewing their secessionist project 
as an expression of deeper social struggles

rooted in caste-class oppression. I advised him 
otherwise, but he only sporadically heeded my 
counsel. He ultimately died as a consequence 
of that misjudgment.
Pillayan (Sivanesathurai 
Chandrakanthan) was arrested over 
the murder of Eastern University Vice 
Chancellor Prof. S. Ravindranath. 
However, critics point out that the 
JVP—now the ruling party—was 
implicated in extrajudicial killings 
during the 1987–89 insurrection, 
including the assassinations of 
Vice Chancellors Prof. Stanley 
Wijesundera (Colombo) and Prof. G. P. 
Samarasinghe (Moratuwa). Shouldn’t 
those cases also be reopened with 
equal seriousness, especially given 
the government's renewed emphasis 
on accountability?
Either there has to be a moratorium on 
accountability, or accountability must be 
universal. This government will never 
investigate the atrocities committed by its 
own party, nor will the general public accept 
accountability hearings focused solely on one 
side, especially in the context of a historical 
period marked by two civil wars—and civil 
wars within civil wars.
Do you believe Sri Lanka can become 
a genuinely multi-ethnic democracy 
without revisiting the constitutional 
primacy of Buddhism?
The moment for that passed with the 
Aragalaya and I can’t envisage when it may 
come again. If it comes up in any discussion 
on a new Constitution, it is enough to ensure 
its defeat at a Referendum. So maybe it should 
be left to another generation.
What is your personal assessment 
of the LTTE and its leader, Velupillai 
Prabhakaran? How do you weigh their 
legacy in the context of Tamil political 
struggle and Sri Lanka’s post-war 
challenges?
I have little to add to what Raghavan said 
in the superb interview in your periodical. 
Prabhakaran was so arrogant that he 
disregarded detailed warnings—issued even in 
Tamil—by N. Sanmugathasan, the legendary 
Communist leader of Sri Lanka. These were 
first published in the Lanka Guardian journal 
in 1984, criticizing the LTTE's complete 
violation of the principles and strategies of 
the People’s War as theorized and practiced 
by Mao Zedong. Prabhakaran ignored 
Sanmugathasan, a fellow Tamil who had met 
Mao multiple times.
The continued survival of Hamas—fighting 
from devastated terrain and underground, 
despite relentless Israeli bombardment—
demonstrates its superiority as a fighting force 
compared to the LTTE. Prabhakaran lacked 
the prudence to revert to guerrilla warfare 
when the Sri Lankan military gained the 
upper hand.
An admirer of Hitler, and a fascist in both 
theory and practice, Prabhakaran met a fate 
similar to Hitler’s—delusional and ultimately 
destroyed, his military decimated.
As long as the Tamil diaspora and hardcore 
nationalists in the North and East of Sri Lanka

continue to revere the Prabhakaran cult and 
the LTTE, they will remain confined to passing 
symbolic resolutions in Western parliaments. 
They would have been wiser to study the 
political and diplomatic success of Sinn Féin.
You often emphasize your academic 
background and global awareness. 
But do you feel the Sri Lankan 
intelligentsia, yourself included, 
has done enough to challenge the 
ideological foundations of post-war 
militarism, ethnic majoritarianism, and 
systemic discrimination?
I think the Southern intelligentsia has 
done more to challenge “the ideological 
foundations of post-war militarism, ethnic 
majoritarianism, and systemic discrimination” 
as evidenced by the Aragalaya, than their 
Northern counterparts have done 
to challenge LTTE fascism and its 
glorification.
As for myself, as a political scientist, 
my main focus and object of concern 
has been the Sri Lankan state. I have 
fought against Sinhala chauvinism for 
decades just as I have fought against 
the JVP in its Pol Pot phase and the 
LTTE in its post-1984 fascist incarnation. 
But my primary project has been two-fold: 
(a) fighting for a Sri Lankan social democracy 
and (b) an application to the contemporary 
Sri Lankan nation-state of the Gramscian 
project of the Modern Prince, which derives 
explicitly from 
Machiavelli’s 
historical 
project of a 
nationally-
unifying 
republican state. 
Your father, Mervyn de Silva, was 
a towering figure in Sri Lankan 
journalism. How has his intellectual 
legacy influenced your political 
thought, diplomatic approach, and 
your engagement?
I realize that I have tried to stay true to 
Mervyn’s ideals and code of values, while 
putting into practice the principles he 
admired. He was a liberal democrat, a 
humanist, and an internationalist. I have 
sought to embody a more radical version of 
the ideas he introduced me to from boyhood 
and adolescence. Maybe I went too far, for too 
long.
