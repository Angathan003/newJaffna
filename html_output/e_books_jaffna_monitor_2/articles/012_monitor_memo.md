Monitor Memo
I
n a striking shake-up within Sri Lanka’s 
police establishment, Chief Inspector 
Ashoka Ariyawansa — the longtime Chief 
Personal Security Officer to former President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe — has been abruptly 
transferred to the Kankesanthurai (KKS) 
Police Station in the country’s northern 
peninsula.
The transfer, effective May 1 and approved 
by the National Police Commission, ends a 
more than two-decade tenure during which 
Ariyawansa served as one of the most trusted 
figures in Wickremesinghe’s inner security 
circle. For 23 years, including 15 as the chief 
of personal security, he remained a constant 
presence alongside the former president, 
through shifting administrations and political 
turbulence.
While no official explanation has been 
provided, senior police sources say the move is 
linked to an incident involving former Eastern 
Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai 
Chandrakanthan, commonly known as 
Pillayan, who is currently in the custody of the 
Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

According to those familiar with the matter, 
CI Ariyawansa allegedly attempted to facilitate 
a phone call between Wickremesinghe and 
Chandrakanthan — a request that reportedly 
raised alarms within the CID. The officer 
is said to have contacted CID personnel to 
inquire whether such a call could be arranged, 
a move seen by some in the department as an 
overreach. The attempt was flagged by CID 
officials to their superiors, prompting what 
appears to be a swift administrative response.
“This isn’t your average reshuffling,” said a 
senior police official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the 
issue. “When someone who’s been at the heart 
of presidential security is suddenly posted to 
a remote northern town, there’s more to the 
story than meets the eye.”
Response from the Former President’s Office
Amid rising media scrutiny, the Office 
of the Former President issued a formal 
statement seeking to clarify the circumstances. 
According to the statement, Wickremesinghe 
had been informed by Chandrakanthan’s office 
that the former MP had been detained, though 
the nature of the charges was unclear. His team 
subsequently requested assistance in obtaining 
further information.
The former president, the statement said, 
was informed that communication might 
be possible through a CID officer named 
Madawa. In accordance with past practice, 
Wickremesinghe directed his security officer 
— CI Ariyawansa — to make an inquiry with 
relevant authorities.
“It has been customary that when the former 
President seeks to contact an individual in 
custody, his security personnel initiate a 
formal request to determine the permissibility 
of such a call,” the statement read.
Ariyawansa is said to have followed procedure 
by reaching out to CID officers, who informed 
him that any such request would require 
clearance from the CID Director. The request 
was later denied.
The former President’s office also raised 
procedural concerns, noting that “it is the 
standard practice that a VIP is informed when 
their security officer is being reassigned” — a 
courtesy they claim was not extended in this 
case.
