Monitor Memo
I
n what many on social media have dubbed 
his ‘Kaipulla moment’—all bravado, little 
substance—M.A. Sumanthiran, acting General 
Secretary of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK), delivered a fiery threat that, to many 
observers, epitomized the opportunistic 
politician willing to stoop to any level to 
radicalize Tamil youth.
“The government must immediately withdraw 
the gazette notification aimed at acquiring 
lands in the North. If not, we will ensure that 
the President cannot come to—or even set foot 
in—Jaffna,” he thundered, channeling, as some 
quipped, the ghost of Prabhakaran issuing an 
ultimatum.
The irony? Prabhakaran never relied on chest-
thumping theatrics. He didn’t issue grand 
threats for applause—he simply acted.
And as expected, newspapers said to be 
sponsored by Sumanthiran’s loyal coterie ran 
the statement like it was a declaration of war—
complete with blazing headlines and soul-sold 
opinion pieces cheering him on.
Yes, many observers agree that the land gazette 
may be unjust and deserves to be withdrawn—
no question about that. But when Sumanthiran 
threatens to stop the President from entering 
Jaffna, no one’s trembling. They’re laughing. 
One social media user mockingly asked, “Is he 
President cannot set foot in Jaffna: 
Sumanthiran’s Kaipulla Moment

going to trip the President by the foot- 'fhiy 
jLf;fp tpOj;jg; Nghwhuh?" Another chimed 
in, “Or maybe tickle his toes- 'fhypy; fpr;R 
fpr;R %l;lg; Nghwhuh?" What could have 
been a serious and principled critique of state 
land policy has instead turned into full-blown 
meme material.
Sumanthiran, not content with the theatrics-or 
perhaps eager to further inflame disillusioned 
Tamil youth-took it a step further on 
Facebook. He shared a campaign poster aimed 
at the NPP, quoting:  'mg;G Mr;rp Mz;l 
kz;iz mg;Gfhkpfs; Ms;tjh?" (“Should 
the land ruled by our forefathers now be 
ruled by Appuhamis?”) -a direct remix of the 
LTTE’s infamous wartime slogan: 'mg;G Mr;rp 
Mz;l kz;iz vjpup Ms;tjh?" (“Should 
the land ruled by our ancestors be ruled by the 
enemy?”)
While this drew applause from his shrinking 
base, the backlash was swift—and scathing. 
Thileepkumar, the NPP’s Kalkudah organizer, 
responded on Facebook with a fiery post 
accusing Sumanthiran of “performative 
nationalism.” He pointed out the irony that 
Sumanthiran’s own children are married to 
Sinhalese. He wrote: “Dear leaders, open the 
doors of your own bedrooms first. Tonight, 
your children are asleep in the arms of the 
very ‘outsiders’ you rage against. When you’ve 
welcomed them into your homes, why stand 
on the streets shouting racist slogans?
What do you call this version of Tamil 
nationalism—where you stir hate among 
ordinary Tamils while you sleep peacefully 
beside Sinhalese?”
Note to non-Tamil readers: Kaipulla is a 
legendary comedy character played by iconic 
comedian Vadivelu in the Tamil film Winner. 
The character is known for his loud bravado, 
empty threats, and-as everyone expects-
inevitable beatings. A cult figure in meme 
culture, Kaipulla talks big… and falls harder.
