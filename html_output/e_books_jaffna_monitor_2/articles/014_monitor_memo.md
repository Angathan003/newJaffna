n what is arguably a first of its kind, twin 
brothers from Jaffna have made academic 
history. Pranavan and Saravanan, students 
of Jaffna Hindu College, have clinched the 
top two positions in the Biological Science 
stream in the Jaffna District at the 2024 G.C.E. 
Advanced Level Examination. But their 
brilliance didn’t stop at the peninsula’s borders 
— the duo went on to secure the 3rd and 5th 
highest island-wide rankings in the same 
stream, making them a sensation far beyond 
the North.
The results, released recently, have drawn 
admiration from educators and students alike, 
highlighting the exceptional performance 
of the siblings in one of the country’s most 
competitive examinations. Both students have 
been selected for admission to the prestigious 
Faculty of Medicine at the University of 
Colombo.
Pranavan and Saravanan, sons of Dr. 
Sivanathan Jamunanantha — Deputy 
Director of the Jaffna Teaching Hospital — 
have unmistakably emerged as role models 
for students across the region. In a candid 
post-exam interview, the duo revealed a 
refreshingly honest secret to their success: 
no TV marathons, no YouTube spirals, and 
absolutely no drama — neither on screen nor 
in real life. “We used our laptop strictly for 
past papers and model exams,” they said with a 
smile.
