The NPP’s Manual: How to 
Lose an Election-and the 
People’s Trust
I 
had initially planned to write a separate article and an 
editorial on this subject. But as I went deeper, I realized 
the story-and the questions it raises-deserve to be told in one 
cohesive piece. Yes, it’s a little lengthy, but I hope you’ll 
bear with me.
I’ve been receiving calls from my Sinhala journalist friends 
as well as foreign correspondents ever since the local 
election results were announced. Their main question has 
been: How did the NPP, which emerged as the leading party 
in the parliamentary election just five months ago in the 
Tamil-majority North, fail to win even a single Municipal 
Council, Urban Council, Pradeshiya Sabha? Even in the 
Tamil-dominated parts of the East, the party couldn’t secure 
control of a single local authority.
How do you explain such a dramatic downfall? Whether I 
was speaking to foreign correspondents or everyday friends, 
my answer remained the same: the NPP betrayed the hopes 
and abused the trust of the Tamil people who had so boldly 
placed their faith in them just six months ago.
Tamil Voters Gave the NPP a Chance-Here’s How 
It Was Squandered
Six months ago, when the parliamentary election results 
were announced in November 2024, Sri Lanka’s political 
landscape underwent a dramatic shift. To the surprise 
of many, the National People’s Power (NPP) secured a

majority of seats in the North and East, 
emerging as the dominant force in Tamil-
majority regions. At the time, political 
observers-and even those who spoke to me-
predicted a sweeping victory for the NPP in 
the upcoming local government elections. 
Many believed the party would take control 
of nearly every Municipal Council, Urban 
Council, and Pradeshiya Sabha in the region 
and begin delivering the clean, transparent 
governance they had promised.
In Jaffna-a district long regarded as the 
epicenter of Tamil nationalism, the birthplace 
of the Tamil Eelam demand, and a region 
that sacrificed countless lives for that cause-
the people elected a Sinhala-majority party, 
the NPP, giving it 3 out of 6 parliment seats 
and 80,830 votes, or 24.84% of the total 
vote. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK), the traditional Tamil party that 
once commanded the unwavering loyalty of 
generations, managed only 19.47%. The All 
Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC), known for 
its hardline nationalist rhetoric, received just 
8.6%.
Now, let’s be clear. This was not a vote 
cast in negligence or out of some collective 
political amnesia. Tamil people knew exactly 
who they were voting for. They knew that 
the NPP was merely a cosmetic rebranding 
of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-a 
party that once filed and won a court case 
against the unification of the North and East, 
that vehemently opposed political solutions 
for Tamils, and that continues to reject even 
the basic rights guaranteed under the 13th 
Amendment.
And yet, the Tamil people voted for them-
not because they were deluded or deceived, 
but because they dared to hope. They voted 
for change. They voted for a new political 
culture. They voted to show that they, too, 
were ready to embrace a unified Sri Lanka. 
They wanted to prove that they were willing 
to work for the betterment of the entire 
country, like true patriots.
They believed the NPP would break from the 
past, hold the corrupt accountable, reject the 
dirty politics of bribery and nepotism, and 
usher in a new, cleaner chapter in Sri Lankan 
governance. Through their vote, the Tamil 
people were sending a message to the world: 
“We, who once fought for a separate state, 
are now ready to move forward as patriotic 
Sri Lankan Tamils.”
As a proud Sri Lankan Tamil and lifelong 
advocate for unity, I was deeply moved by 
what I saw. In that moment of unprecedented 
change, I wrote a special piece for Jaffna 
Monitor titled “North and East Bid Farewell 
to Rhetorical Tamil Nationalism, Embrace a 
Unified Sri Lanka.” I also penned an editorial 
that was widely quoted and shared. In it, I 
invoked the immortal words of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech-
reframed in the Sri Lankan context-and 
wrote:
"I have a dream that one day, from the tip of 
Jaffna to the bottom of Matara, little Tamil 
boys and girls will join hands with Sinhala, 
Muslim, and Burgher boys and girls as 
sisters and brothers".
"I have a dream that my children will one 
day live in a nation where they will not 
be judged by the race, religion, or caste of 
their ancestors but by the content of their 
character."
At the time, it felt like we were on the brink 
of something extraordinary-a moment when 
reconciliation wasn’t just a slogan, but a 
shared national heartbeat.

Now, fast forward six months to the local 
government elections in Jaffna. The NPP’s 
vote share dropped sharply to 20.45%, 
securing only 56,615 votes-a loss of nearly 
25,000 votes in just half a year. Meanwhile, 
ITAK surged to 32%, the ultra-Tamil 
nationalist ACTC climbed to 18.44%, and 
the Democratic Tamil National Alliance 
(DTNA) recorded a respectable 12.88%.
Hope’s Expiration Date
A foreign correspondent recently asked me 
a question that struck at the heart of Sri 
Lanka’s evolving political landscape: “How 
is it that a people who, just six months ago, 
voted overwhelmingly for change and unity 
in Sri Lanka are now turning back to Tamil 
nationalist parties?”
It was a valid question. Voting for ITAK is 
understandable-they’ve long enjoyed the 
loyalty of Tamil voters, often regardless of 
their performance, which has largely been 
underwhelming. But how do you explain 
the sharp rise of the All Ceylon Tamil 
Congress (ACTC)-a party that openly rejects 
any settlement within a unified Sri Lanka 
and unapologetically pushes ultra-Tamil 
nationalism? How did their vote share nearly 
double? Even ITAK’s numbers surged. What 
changed?
My answer was this: When people place their 
faith in a genuine promise of transformation-
and those they trusted end up indulging in 
the very same corrupt, nepotistic political 
games they vowed to dismantle, the sense 
of betrayal cuts deep. In that vacuum of 
hope, people often turn to hardliners. Not 
necessarily out of ideological conviction, but 
out of profound disillusionment.
This isn’t unique to Sri Lanka-it’s a pattern 
we’ve seen across the world.
In Greece, years of austerity and broken 
promises from centrist coalitions led to the 
rise of the radical left. When that, too, failed 
to deliver, many disillusioned voters turned 
to the far-right Golden Dawn. In Germany, 
regions that once backed the Greens or 
Social Democrats shifted sharply toward the 
far-right AfD after feeling abandoned on key 
issues like immigration and national identity.
In the Philippines, anger at elitist governance 
paved the way for Rodrigo Duterte’s rise and 
his brand of uncompromising nationalism. In 
the United States, after eight years of centrist 
leadership under Barack Obama, large 
swathes of the electorate swung dramatically 
toward Donald Trump, seeking disruption, 
even at the cost of social cohesion. Sri Lanka 
is no exception.
When the Tamil people of the North voted 
for the NPP, they were reaching across 
decades of division, placing their trust in a 
party they hoped would rise above ethnic 
fault lines and bring real change. But when 
that promise dissolved into the familiar rot of 
corruption, arrogance, and political silence-
repackaged in a new logo-they turned away.
And this time, they turned harder.
Why Build When You Can Buy? The 
NPP’s Fatal Shortcut in the North
Let me dissect this downfall. The NPP-or 
rather, the JVP in a new cosmetic avatar-had 
no real grassroots presence in the North and 
East. There were no cadre-based structures, 
no organized party machinery, and no history 
of meaningful local engagement. They didn’t 
win because they earned trust on the ground-
they won because the people were yearning

for change. More importantly, they believed 
in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake 
and the image he had carefully built-one of 
modesty, integrity, and simplicity.
I remember speaking to a mother whose two 
sons-LTTE cadres-were martyred during 
the war. She told me she voted for Anura 
Kumara in the presidential election and 
again for the NPP in the parliamentary polls. 
When I asked her why, she replied without a 
pause: “Anura Thampi looks like one of us. 
He will definitely put an end to corruption 
and make us prosperous.” She was not 
alone. Thousands of Tamil fathers, mothers, 
brothers, and sisters saw Anura Kumara as 
one of their own-and voted for him with their 
hearts full of hope. That was the depth of 
their faith.
As the local government elections 
approached, the NPP had two clear paths 
before them in the North. One path was 
difficult but honorable: to work hard from the 
ground up-recruit fresh, clean, youth-driven 
local leaders in every village, build genuine 
grassroots structures, and stay true to their 
anti-corruption ethos. Even if they didn’t win 
this time, they would at least have laid the 
foundation for a credible and ethical political 
movement, ready to contest future elections 
with integrity.
The other path was far easier-and all too 
familiar. It was the one systematically 
followed by every corrupt party before them: 
open the floodgates to opportunists and build 
instant structures by welcoming defectors 
from other parties.
Guess which one NPP chose?
They flung open their doors and ushered in a 
parade of opportunists-turncoats, molesters, 
thieves, and the full gallery of rogues. 
Professional looters, amateur swindlers, men 
who had feasted on public funds like jackals 
at a carcass-every variety of political predator 
was embraced.
Many of these individuals came straight 
from discredited Tamil parties, and yet, the 
moment they joined the NPP, they were 
treated like saints. It was almost mythical-
like the story of Ahalya, instantly redeemed 
when touched by Rama’s foot. Except in 
this case, Rama was none other than the 
NPP’s Jaffna District organizer, Minister 
Ramalingam Chandrasekar.
New Makeup, Same Mercenaries: The 
NPP’s Jaffna Rebranding Circus
In Jaffna, there exists a well-known gang of 
political mercenaries-men who have made a 
career out of hovering near power, no matter 
who wields it. When Douglas Devananda 
was in office, they clung to him. When 
Angajan Ramanathan rose, they marched 
loyally behind him. When Vijayakala 
took the stage, they sang her praises like 
seasoned choirboys. For these men, ideology 
and principle are meaningless. Their only 
compass is proximity to power, and they’re 
willing to perform any political belly dance 
to stay near its warmth and taste its spoils.
And now, many of these very mercenaries 
have added a few theatrical touches-perhaps 
a wart on the cheek or a mustache twist-to 
reinvent themselves as the new "clean" faces 
of the NPP in Jaffna. Just like those old Tamil 
cinema villains doing double roles, they think 
a little makeup and a costume change can 
fool the audience.
How to Turn a Political Crook into a 
‘Comrade’-and Give Him Power: The

NPP’s Manual
One of the NPP’s earliest appointments in 
Jaffna exposed everything. They named a 
known crook as Chairman of the Palmyrah 
Development Board. I know his victims 
personally-diaspora donors who lost 
millions after he promised them government 
approvals to set up salterns. At the time, 
he was the loyal footman of a Jaffna-based 
minister.
This man has made a profession out of 
switching loyalties. When the LTTE held 
power, he cozied up to them. After their fall, 
he aligned with Douglas Devananda. When 
the minister discovered his crooked ways, 
he slipped into the circle of then Deputy 
Minister Vijayakala. Later, he flirted with 
the SLPP for a few years. And now, with 
polished shoes and a new political costume, 
he’s parading under the NPP banner-and not 
as a foot soldier, but as a kingmaker.
A respected former AGA-known for his 
honesty-publicly wrote on Facebook 
that this man had cheated him, causing 
serious financial loss. But all of that 
was conveniently ignored. He was 
whitewashed, embraced, and elevated by 
the so-called “NPP’s Prince of Jaffna,” 
Minister Chandrasekar, who handed him the 
chairmanship of the Palmyrah Development 
Board like it was a reward for excellence in 
deception.
Shouldn’t that infuriate the public? A man 
who managed to loot public funds simply 
by being close to power in the past is now 
handed real power-won’t he loot even more? 
If he could do that with just proximity, 
what might he do now, sitting at the center 
of authority? That’s a simple, common-
sense question. But Minister Chandrasekar 
doesn’t seem the least bit concerned. When 
questioned by the press, he casually brushes 
it off, as if this man were some distant cousin 
of Raja Harishchandra, the legendary king 
who never told a lie or committed a single 
dishonest act.
Some argue that Chandrasekar, hailing from 
Nuwara Eliya, simply doesn’t understand 
the political terrain of Jaffna-and that 
these crooks have taken him for a ride. 
That may be true. But come on-if I were 
hiring someone to work at Jaffna Monitor, 
wouldn’t I at least check their background? 
Isn’t that the bare minimum expected of any 
responsible leader? Or does background 
verification require Einstein-level scientific 
expertise?
70% Recycled: The Rotten Core of 
NPP’s Jaffna Candidacy
A friend of mine and I sat down recently 
to conduct a small survey-and ran a few 
calculations. What we found was alarming. 
In Jaffna, over 70% of the NPP’s local 
government candidates were individuals who 
had previously contested under other parties. 
Among them were several with a well-
documented history of looting public funds.
One classic example stood out. A former 
Pradeshiya Sabha president-infamous for his 
“creativity”-once oversaw the construction of 
a bridge. But he wasn’t content with building 
it once. He submitted the same proposal 
to both the Sri Lankan government and an 
international donor organization, securing 
funds from both. The double-dipping was 
eventually exposed during the international 
body’s audit.
The party he belonged to at the time-no 
stranger to corruption-was so embarrassed

by the scandal that they expelled him. But 
guess what? In the most recent local election, 
that very same man contested as an NPP 
candidate.
Who exactly are you trying to fool?
Another NPP candidate has multiple theft 
charges to his name. And then there’s a 
man from Nallur-once a loud champion of 
pure-blood Tamil nationalism and a former 
member of the troublemaking TNPF-who 
shamelessly contested under the NPP banner 
in the last local government election.
Have you heard of 'Naveena' Ravanan 
("Modern Ravana”)? A notorious London-
based diaspora firebrand, he was once a die-
hard Tamil nationalist and a loud cheerleader 
for Seeman, the rabble-rousing Indian 
Tamil politician. In one infamous incident 
at a public meeting in London, attended by 
Indian MP Thol. Thirumavalavan-Naveena 
Ravanan stormed in, shouted “Traitor!” at 
the parliamentarian, and single-handedly 
disrupted the entire event.
Like many diaspora ideologues whose voices 
grow louder the farther they are from home, 
he made his fortune abroad, then returned to 
Sri Lanka to start both a fringe organisation 
called Naveena Ravanan Senai (“The Army 
of the Modern Ravana”) and a “farm” in 
Pallai.
He went party shopping, knocking on the 
doors of every major Tamil party in search 
of a ticket. All of them turned him down. So, 
in 2024, he launched his own independent 
group and contested under the symbol of a 
“water pipe.” His performance was so dismal 
that a friend joked, “Even his wife must have 
voted for someone else.”
And yet, after the NPP came to power, 
he somehow managed to forge ties with 
the ruling party and is now paraded as the 
NPP’s face in Pallai. The once-fiery Tamil 
nationalist, who once shouted slogans of 
ethnic purity and separatism, and repeatedly 
referred to Prabhakaran as Suriya Devan 
(Sun God) to entertain his diaspora-backed 
followers, is now awkwardly quoting Das 
Kapital, name-dropping Karl Marx and 
Friedrich Engels as if he were born waving 
the red flag.
His once-fringe meetings have suddenly 
become headline events, attended by 
none other than Prime Minister Harini 
Amarasuriya and NPP’s northern chief, 
Bimal Rathnayake. Rathnayake even paid a 
courtesy visit to his farm for a meal-an event 
Naveena Ravanan triumphantly flaunted on 
Facebook, complete with photos, proudly 
boasting that a cabinet minister had dined at 
his table.
So what exactly are they trying to tell us? 
That the entire Northern Province is just a 
gullible mass of fools?
And it doesn’t stop there. Just take a 
closer look at the list of NPP candidates in 
Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. You’ll quickly 
discover that many of them have been 
involved in illegal river sand mining and the 
shameless plundering of natural resources-
acts that have devastated local ecosystems 
and livelihoods. And yet, these very 
individuals had no hesitation contesting the 
recent local government elections under the 
NPP banner-and the NPP, showing either a 
complete lack of political judgment or basic 
shame, had no issue fielding them as official 
candidates. All this from a party that claims 
to be the last bastion of honesty. The irony 
writes itself.

Whose Man Is Chandrasekar, Really?
Fisheries Minister Ramalingam 
Chandrasekar-Jaffna District organizer of the 
NPP and a longtime JVP cadre-has conducted 
himself in ways that many Northern Tamils 
would find deeply inappropriate. The way he 
speaks carries an unmistakable tone: “Mind 
it, we JVP have a militant past,” followed 
by the unspoken but palpable attitude: “This 
is who we are, and we’ll continue to act this 
way-do whatever the hell you can.”
I was genuinely happy when Chandrasekar 
was appointed both as Cabinet Minister of 
Fisheries and President of the Jaffna District 
Coordinating Committee. Why? Because 
he was born in Nuwara Eliya and grew up 
in abject poverty. I saw in him the rise of 
a Malayaga Tamil-a community that has 
historically been denied dignity by the caste-
obsessed elite of Jaffna.
Even within the rigid caste hierarchy of the 
North, Malayaga Tamils are placed beneath 
the Dalits by some so-called “high-caste” 
circles. So, for me, it was refreshing-almost 
poetic justice-to see someone from that 
background rise to a position of power and 
influence in Jaffna. I thought, “Here comes 
a hardworking, genuine Malayaga Tamil to 
finally challenge this rotten caste structure.”
But my hopes have been shattered.
The NPP appointed Professor Kapilan as its 
mayoral candidate for Jaffna. According to 
sources at the university where he taught, 
Kapilan abruptly abandoned his academic 
duties to contest the election, without 
completing the semester’s lectures or 
evaluating student papers. Many within the 
academic community viewed this as highly 
unethical.
But that was only the beginning.
A far more serious concern was that 
Kapilan was not even a resident of the 
Jaffna Municipal Council area. He hails 
from Erlalai, a village located outside the 
municipal boundaries. Under the law, a 
candidate for mayor must reside within the 
jurisdiction of the relevant municipal council. 
To sidestep this requirement, Kapilan falsely 
listed the NPP’s Jaffna party office as his own 
residential address in his nomination papers.
At a press conference, ITAK’s acting General 
Secretary, M.A. Sumanthiran, publicly 
declared that Kapilan was ineligible to 
contest the mayoral post and warned that 
legal action would be initiated to challenge 
and remove him if elected.
In the end, NPP lost, and the legal drama 
never materialized.
But when journalists questioned Minister  
Chandrasekar about the legality of 
Kapilan’s candidacy, his response came in 
a manner many described as thuggish and 
confrontational. He declared that Kapilan 
was “not alone” and warned that “the entire 
NPP government is behind him.”
To many in Jaffna-particularly those who 
have lived through the authoritarianism of 
Sinhala-majority regimes-this came across as 
a chilling threat. It was seen as a dangerous 
message: that even the law cannot touch 
the NPP’s chosen candidates. That they are 
untouchable. That they have come not to 
serve, but to dominate.
In that sense, Minister Chandrasekaran may 
have inflicted more damage on his own 
party’s image than any political opponent 
could have hoped to.

MPs or Meme Material?
Among the three NPP MPs elected from 
Jaffna, longtime JVP cadre Ilankumaran 
stands out-not for his brilliance or leadership, 
but as a textbook example of how not to be a 
Member of Parliament, or at the very least, a 
decent human being.
His public statements often leave people 
bewildered. He famously declared “ehq;fs; 
,jz;LNthk;”-a colloquial Jaffna Tamil 
phrase for “we will do it”-but delivered 
with such misplaced bravado that it became 
the butt of local jokes. His grasp of basic 
geography isn’t much better. At one point, he 
bizarrely claimed that “Jaffna is in Erlalai,” 
confusing the district with the village, rather 
than saying Erlalai is in Jaffna.
Then came the infamous District 
Development Committee meeting-a 
forum meant to address vital issues like 
infrastructure, education, and livelihoods. 
But for Ilankumaran, it turned into a 
testosterone-fueled playground. He got 
into a loud, childish argument with another 
controversial Jaffna MP, Dr. Archchuna. But 
instead of discussing road repairs or public 
services, the two MPs loudly accused each 
other of chasing women.
Yes, you read that right. One shouted, “We 
all know how many girlfriends you had!” and 
the other shot back with “You went behind 
every girl you saw!” All this, in a room full 
of officials trying to discuss development 
plans.
Even Minister Chandrasekar-no stranger to 
rough talk-lost his patience. He slammed the 
table and shouted, “Dei Kumara, stop it!”
Then there’s Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy. 
Just months before his dramatic switch to the 
NPP-right before the parliamentary election 
in November 2024-he was a loyal footman 
of ITAK heavyweight M.A. Sumanthiran. 
He regularly posted on social media, 
passionately urging people to rally behind 
Sumanthiran and Shanakiyan Rasamanickam. 
Then, as if turning off a switch, he deleted 
all those posts, rebranded himself overnight, 
and re-emerged as an NPP candidate. And 
surprisingly, he won.
But what has he done since taking office?
Within just four months of becoming an MP, 
he managed to appoint four of his own family 
members as Justices of the Peace (JPs). He 
also fielded his father, Jeyachandramoorthy, 
who had previously contested under ITAK 
and secured only a handful of votes, as the 
NPP candidate for the Velanai Pradeshiya 
Sabha. As if that wasn’t enough, he pushed 
another relative into a different local body 
candidacy.
When a diaspora critic called him out on 
Facebook, Jeyachandramoorthy lashed out, 
saying those who “wash plates abroad” 
should stick to doing just that. What he 
didn’t realize is that washing plates abroad 
is, in fact, far more dignified than washing 
politicians’ feet for scraps of power.
The only one among the three who can’t 
be accused of being foul-mouthed is Dr. 
Bhavananda Raja, only because he simply 
doesn’t speak, even when it's absolutely 
necessary.
While Voters Walked Away, NPP’s 
Leaders Stayed Asleep
Minister Chandrasekaran appears to be 
completely out of touch with political reality.

Following the local government election 
debacle, he wrote in a recent Facebook 
post: “The trust that the Tamil people have 
in the National People’s Power (NPP) has 
not diminished. A general election is one 
thing; a local government election is another. 
Therefore, the results of the local government 
election must be compared with the 
previous local government election results. 
On that basis, in the 2018 elections, NPP 
representation in the North could be counted 
on one’s fingers. But this time, the NPP has 
secured representation in every part of the 
North.”
There is an element of truth in what he 
says-yes, the NPP now has more local-
level representation than in 2018. But what 
Chandrasekaran fails to grasp is the bigger 
picture: how did a party that swept the North 
just six months ago in the general election 
manage to lose 25,000 votes in Jaffna alone-
and fail to win even a single local body-
despite holding national power? With all the 
machinery of government at their disposal, 
the vote share should have surged, not 
nosedived.
Surrounded by a circle of yes-men, 
Chandrasekaran seems completely insulated 
from criticism. And he’s not alone. Even 
senior NPP figure and Northern organizer 
Bimal Rathnayake casually dismissed the 
defeat, claiming in Parliament that ITAK’s 
win in the North was due to the distribution of 
kasippu (illicit alcohol).
Who gave what to whom? I honestly don’t 
know. But one thing I can confidently vouch 
for-if anyone did hand out alcohol and asked 
the Northern Tamils to vote for them, they 
definitely took the drink… but absolutely 
didn’t give the vote. That’s the story of our 
people-they’ll raise a glass with you, laugh 
at your jokes… and then quietly go vote for 
someone they actually believe in. When it 
comes to that, they’re PhD holders.
Let me remind you of an incident. After the 
war, when the Rajapaksa regime was hell-
bent on winning Jaffna-to show the world 
that the Tamils were with them-in the 2010 
parliamentary elections, they allegedly 
distributed alcohol and even arranged special 
bus services, just to make sure no one missed 
the vote, fully believing the votes would go to 
them. You know what our people did? They 
took the alcohol, boarded the buses arranged 
by the then ruling party, and voted for the 
TNA-the party they believed in at the time.
What’s clear is that both Bimal and 
Chandrasekaran are echoing narratives fed 
to them by the latest crop of opportunists-
political shapeshifters who’ve floated from 
party to party, mastered the art of survival, 
and now serve the NPP. These are the types 
who know exactly what the leadership wants 
to hear-and say nothing more.
The real question is this: Will the NPP’s 
top leadership continue to fall for these 
comforting excuses? Or will they finally 
confront the truth, recalibrate, and change 
course-before the damage becomes 
irreversible?
