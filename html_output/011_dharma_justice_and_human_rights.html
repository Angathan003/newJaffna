D
harma is a systematic Sanskrit concept 
that includes traditions, obligation, 
morals, laws, order, and justice. It was a unique 
concept of dharma that kept checks and 
balances on sovereign officials and prevented 
them from becoming autocratic and anarchist. 
It also provided the common man with a 
protective shield against the dictatorship of 
sovereign officials. Ordinary citizens had more 
privileges and fewer responsibilities relative 
to the state's highest officials. The greater the 
authority, the less his privileges were, and the 
more extensive his responsibilities became.
Dharmaśāstras or Righteous Science, are the 
collections of rules of life. Religion has always 
played a crucial role in the advancement of 
human rights, particularly in the advancement 
of human dignity (Harees-2012). Human 
rights defined in Vedic literature tend to 
be fundamental, unchangeable, and place a 
greater emphasis on human obligations than 
on human rights.
The world came up with the high ideals of 
liberty, freedom, and fraternity, during the 
French revolution (Setzer-2013). These three 
principles are enshrined in almost every 
democratic constitution in the world.
Young Hindus are schooled on concepts of 
Dharma. Buddhists from a different prism. 
Equally Jurists such as Upendra Baxi wrote 
about, ’Taking suffering seriously’ to Justice 
Bhagwati and Justice Krishna Iyer who took 
the Supreme Court to the poor, the underclass 
and those discriminated. Pakistan had Justice

Dorab Patel, Asma Jehangir, and I.A. Rehman. 
 In Sri Lanka we had S. Nadesan Q.C. This is 
what was said in tribute at the Supreme Court 
on his passing. Reference to Death of late 
Mr. Nadesan, Queens Counsel made in Sri 
Lanka Supreme Court in Ceremonial Sitting at 
Hulftsdorp, Colombo, Sri Lanka on 16 January 
1987.
"...Nadesan was a front-rank lawyer who 
was a crusader for human rights and an 
aggressive champion of social justice...He will 
be gratefully remembered by many a person 
coming from various strata of our society. 
The Civil Rights Movement has lost one of its 
founder members and an ardent human rights 
activist and the country has lost a pre-eminent 
lawyer with a social conscience..." Sri Lanka 
Chief Justice S. Sharvananda
When one provides free legal aid to the 
vulnerable one sees all manner of injustices. 
Combine with visits to Prisons, Police Stations, 
places of detention, sites of atrocities and 
courts one is informed of inhuman wrongs. 
These are but a few instances and contexts 
which influence once belief in the importance 
of human rights. 
The Responsibility to Protect in Sri 
Lanka
Due to the vagaries of our history in the past 
4-5 decades human rights of citizens has been 
a topic of debate and discussion and even 
censure.</p>
<p>The principle of the responsibility to protect 
is based upon the underlying premise that 
sovereignty entails a responsibility to protect 
all populations from mass atrocity crimes 
and human rights violations.  This passage is 
mentioned in the context of an introduction of 
why the state is held responsible to protect our 
citizens.
What are the three rules of 
sovereignty?
Domestic sovereignty – actual control over 
a state exercised by an authority organized 
within this state.
Interdependence sovereignty – actual control 
of movement across the state's borders.
International legal sovereignty – formal 
recognition by other sovereign states.
The sovereign state's responsibility and 
accountability to both domestic and 
external constituencies must be affirmed as 
interconnected principles of the national and 
international order. Such a normative code is 
anchored in the assumption that in order to 
be legitimate sovereignty must demonstrate 
responsibility.
Sovereignty is a political concept that refers 
to a dominant power or supreme authority. 
In a monarchy, supreme power resides in the 
sovereign, such as a king or queen. In modern 
democracies, sovereign power rests with the 
people and is exercised through representative 
bodies such as Congress or Parliament.
In Sri Lanka Laws and policies are guided by 
the Directive Principles of State Policy found 
in our Constitution.
K. Mathan in FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 
VS DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE 
POLICY: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF 
SRI LANKAN POSITION WITH INDIA 
has looked at the applicability. ‘The Supreme 
Court of Sri Lanka emphasized the importance 
of directive principles of state policy in the 
Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution 
Bill. Although it is expressly declared in the 
Constitution that the directive principles</p>
<p>Jaffna Monitor

and fundamental duties ‘do not confer or 
impose legal rights or obligations and are not 
enforceable in any Court or Tribunal’ Courts 
have linked the Directive Principles to the 
public trust doctrine and have stated that these 
principles should guide state functionaries in 
the excise of their powers.
WHAT ARE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES?
Directive principles are principles intended to 
guide the State when making policy.  Here are 
some examples:
‘[Article] 27(2):   The State is pledged to 
establish in Sri Lanka a democratic socialist 
society, the objectives of which include:
• The full realization of the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of all persons;
• The promotion of the welfare of the People 
by securing and protecting as effectively as it 
may, a social order in which justice (social, 
economic and political) shall guide all the 
institutions of the national life;
• The realization by all citizens of adequate 
standard of living for themselves and their 
families, including adequate food, clothing 
and housing, the continuous improvement 
of living conditions and the full enjoyment 
of leisure and social and cultural 
opportunities, etc. etc.
27(7):   The State shall eliminate economic 
and social privilege and disparity, and the 
exploitation of man by man or by the State.
27(8):   The State shall ensure that the 
operation of the economic system does 
not result in a concentration of wealth and 
the means of production to the common 
detriment.
27(9):   The State shall ensure social security 
and welfare.’
I argue human rights is not an abstract 
notion or a fashionable statement. It requires 
serious consideration. The failure has serious 
consequences. It goes beyond the traditional 
understanding of illegal arrest, detention, 
torture or disappearances. The canvass as seen 
is far wider.
Protecting citizens
I doubt if the Human Rights Commission vets 
or filters cabinet decisions for compliance of 
the directive principles.   The cabinet secretary 
is unlikely to advice the cabinet of the need to 
do so either. The Public Services Commission 
needs to ask if its job is only the removal, 
appointment or transfer of public officials. 
The Administrative Services Tribunal does 
a stirling job of protection. The Governor at 
the Province has a serious task of ensuring 
‘protection’. The absence such executive 
responses leads to violations.  The Northern 
Provincial Public Services Commission with 
the incumbent Governor then as Chairman 
was given a new of set of objectives to fill 
gaps   seen in the protection and promotion 
of development of the provincial cadre.  A 
particular feature was seen in this text,’ The 
Provincial Public Service was informed of 
the intention to do so in December and 
specifically to,  to promote the wellbeing 
of Provincial Public Service Officers of the 
Northern Province with career development 
paths , protection from discrimination, 
harassment including sexual harassment, 
victimization, witness protection of whistle 
blowers, timely transfers, supporting access 
to statutory claims, leave,  allowances, access 
to fundamental facilities for sanitation, safe 
water, partaking of meals, safety of personal 
belongings and official data’.</p>
