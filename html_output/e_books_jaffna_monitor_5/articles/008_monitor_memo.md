Monitor Memo
NPP’s ‘Liquor Mafia’ 
Crusade? Turns Out, It’s 
Just a Mocktail of Excuses!
T
he National People's Power (NPP) 
government has pulled off a somersault 
that few would dare to attempt! "The NPP 
government has not issued any new liquor 
licenses, nor does it intend to. However, 
arbitrarily revoking licenses legally issued 
during the previous administration could lead 
to legal complications. Once a permit is legally 
issued, it becomes a binding document, and 
no amount of drama can turn it into a 'non-
permit,'" stated the Leader of the House and 
Minister, Bimal Rathnayake.
This statement was made in response to ITAK 
MP Kavindran Kodeeswaran, who raised the 
issue during the recent parliamentary debate 
on the Clean Sri Lanka Initiative. He stated, 
"The people of Kalmunai-Neelavanai have 
expressed their opposition to the opening of 
new liquor outlets in the area. The government 
had previously pledged to revoke liquor 
licenses issued by the former administration, 
but so far, no action has been taken."
Empty Promises and Broken Trust
"The NPP’s election campaign was like a 
blockbuster movie trailer, a political observer 
noted to Jaffna Monitor—packed with 
dramatic promises, intense music, and a catchy 
tagline that promised change. Among their 
bold pledges was: 'We’re here to expose the 
liquor mafia and their political godfathers!'
Voters, especially in northern Sri Lanka, were 
hooked, thinking, 'Finally, a party that isn’t just

serving us the same old 
stale political biryani—
one that actually speaks 
truth to power!'
But now, the observer 
remarked, the so-called 
blockbuster has turned 
out to be a low-budget 
spoof—no plot, no 
climax, and certainly 
no ticket-worthy 
moments."
The government’s 
excuses—legal 
complications, 
administrative 
challenges—sound like 
a lazy student trying 
to explain why their 
homework is missing, 
another political 
observer remarked. A critic, in conversation 
with Jaffna Monitor, pointed out that the 
government's behavior resembles a classic 
Vadivelu comedy: "That was one mouth… this 
is the rotten mouth!" (mJ Ntw tha;... ,J 
ehw tha;!!)
Another observer noted that instead of 
revelations, we’re getting a masterclass in 
political gymnastics—twists, turns, and 
somersaults that would make even an Olympic 
athlete jealous. The only thing transparent so 
far is the government’s ability to dodge its own 
promises like a pro, he concluded.
The Legal Quandary
While the government’s reluctance to revoke 
existing licenses may have some legal basis, 
critics argue that the NPP’s campaign rhetoric 
suggested a far more aggressive approach. 
During the elections, the party vowed to 
expose the names of new bar owners and the 
politicians backing them. Yet, no such list has 
been made public, leaving voters to wonder if 
the promise was merely a dramatic dialogue 
crafted for applause rather than action.
Adding to the frustration is the lack of clarity 
on the legal hurdles. How many liquor licenses 
were issued by the previous administration? 
What specific legal or administrative 
challenges are preventing the government 
from taking action? Without answers to these 
questions, the public is left to speculate, and 
trust in the government continues to erode.
The NPP now faces a critical choice, a political 
observer noted to Jaffna Monitor—double 
down on its commitment to transparency and 
take concrete steps to address the liquor mafia, 
or risk becoming just another political party 
that failed to live up to its own hype.
