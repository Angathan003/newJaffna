Cuban Ambassador Meets 
JVP Leadership, Discusses US 
Sanctions on Cuba
C
olombo, Sri Lanka – In a significant 
diplomatic engagement, Cuba’s 
Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Andrés Marcelo 
González Garrido, met with Janatha Vimukthi 
Peramuna (JVP) General Secretary Tilvin 
Silva at the party’s headquarters. The meeting, 
which underscored the longstanding 
solidarity between the two entities, focused on 
geopolitical concerns, including the economic 
blockade imposed on Cuba by the United 
States, sources told Jaffna Monitor.
The JVP, a Marxist-Leninist political party and 
a key constituent of the ruling NPP coalition, 
has historically shared a deep ideological 
affinity with Cuba, particularly since the 
Cuban Revolution of 1959. The revolution, 
led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, inspired 
leftist movements worldwide, including the 
JVP, which was founded in 1965. Over the 
decades, the JVP has consistently expressed 
solidarity with Cuba, advocating for its right 
to self-determination and opposing foreign 
interference in its affairs. JVP founder Rohana 
Wijeweera frequently acknowledged that 
the Cuban Revolution was a major source of 
inspiration for him.
Cuba, in turn, has been a vocal supporter of 
anti-imperialist movements globally, including 
in Sri Lanka. The country has provided 
educational and medical assistance to Sri 
Lanka, offering scholarships for students to 
study medicine in Cuba, further strengthening

the bond between the two nations. The JVP 
has often cited Cuba’s resilience in the face of 
U.S. sanctions as a model for resisting external 
pressures.
Discussions on US Sanctions and 
Geopolitical Concerns
According to sources, during the meeting, 
Ambassador González Garrido expressed 
gratitude for the JVP’s unwavering solidarity 
with Cuba, particularly its support for the 
Cuban Revolution and its opposition to the 
U.S.-led economic blockade. He highlighted 
the devastating impact of the embargo, 
which has been in place since 1962, on 
Cuba’s economy and its people. Despite 
these challenges, Cuba has continued to 
prioritize social welfare, education, and 
healthcare, earning global recognition for its 
achievements.
Tilvin Silva reaffirmed the JVP’s commitment 
to advocating for the removal of the economic, 
financial, and commercial embargo imposed 
on Cuba. The Cuban envoy reiterated Havana’s 
stance against what it considers unjustified 
international pressure, particularly the U.S. 
sanctions. He emphasized that Cuba remains 
committed to peaceful coexistence and mutual 
respect among nations, despite the challenges 
posed by the embargo.
Also present at the meeting were Maribel 
Duarte González, First Secretary of the Cuban 
Embassy, and Ruvini Kalpana Madhubashini 
from the JVP.
