July 1983 Riots 
Black July is generally seen as the start of 
full-scale Sri Lankan Civil War between the 
Tamil militants and the government of Sri 
Lanka. Due to the significance of its role in 
exacerbating the ethnic conflict, a detailed 
account of events is provided. On 23 July 
1983 at around 11.30pm the rebel Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (the Tamil Tigers or 
the LTTE) ambushed the Four Bravo military 
patrol in Tirunelveli near Jaffna in northern 
Sri Lanka. A road-side bomb was detonated 
beneath the Jeep that was leading the convoy, 
injuring at least two soldiers on board. As 
soldiers travelling in a truck which was 
following the Jeep dismounted to help their 
colleagues, they were ambushed by a group of 
Tamil Tiger fighters, who fired at them with 
automatic weapons and hurled grenades at 
them. In the ensuing clashes, one officer and 
12 soldiers were killed immediately, while two 
more were fatally wounded, bringing the total 
death toll to 15 along with a number of rebels. 
Kittu, a regional commander of the LTTE later 
admitted to planning and carrying out the 
ambush. 
The Army, including its Commander Tissa 
Weeratunga, did not want the soldiers' 
funeral held in Jaffna and they did not want 
to hand the bodies over to their families to 
avoid disturbances at multiple locations. The 
decision was made at the highest levels to 
hold the funeral, with full military honours, 
at Colombo's General Cemetery at Kanatte. 
Notwithstanding these measures the pre- 
planned riots of July 1983 unfolded with 
catastrophic consequences. The back of the 
nation of was broken and fodder provided for 
decades of fratricide. 
July has become a time of mourning and 
remembrance amongst the Sri Lankan 
Tamil diaspora around the world who come 
together to commemorate the loss of Tamils. 
This has happened in countries such as 
Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, 
Germany, France, Great Britain, Australia, 
and New Zealand. Eventually the Sri Lankan 
government put the death toll at about 300 
dead. More than 18,000 houses and numerous 
commercial establishments were destroyed 
and hundreds of thousands of Tamils fled the 
country to Europe, Australia and Canada. 
Many Tamil youths also joined the various 
Tamil groups including the Tamil Tigers.

Post 1983 
The aftermath of the 1983 race riots brought a 
flood of recruits into the militant groups. The 
militant movements had become fractured 
in 1980 with the split between Prabhakaran 
and Uma Maheswaran. The latter went on 
to found the P.L.O.T.E. (Peoples Liberation 
Organisation of Tamil Eelam) and the former 
the L.T.T.E. (Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam). 
The other significant militant groups were 
the T.E.L.O, the E.P.R.L.F. and the E.R.O.S. 
The trouble fomented by the government in 
the Eastern Province in 1984 found a large 
number of eastern province youths joining 
the militancy. The motivation of these youths 
was very different from that of their more 
intellectual and reflective predecessors from 
the University. Revenge, anger and utter 
helplessness were now leading motives. But 
the ground work had already been laid by 
the articulate students who had roamed the 
villages holding meetings. This suited the 
militant leadership. The new recruits would 
do what they were told, and not ask awkward 
questions. The L.T.T.E. could now drop its 
pretences concerning internationalism and

socialism and show itself as a tightly controlled 
military organisation. The T.E.L.O. never had 
any pretences about intellectual leanings. By 
September 1985 a large number of refugees 
from the Trincomalee district were flooding 
into Jaffna, and these refugees who were very 
desperate were widely used in demonstrations. 
Many boys in their early teens from the 
refugee population joined mainly the E.P.R.L.F. 
and the T.E.L.O. The E.P.R.L.F. was the first to 
recruit girls. The L.T.T.E. was however more 
discriminating in its recruitment. 
Distraught parents became a regular sight 
around L.T.T.E. camps crying and begging for 
their children who had run away and joined 
the movement. The militant movement had 
come a long way from its origins amongst 
the undergraduates of Peradeniya, who 
talked, theorized and then went abroad. 
Death, disillusionment and assassination had 
removed most of the able and mature leaders 
from amongst the militants. Their average 
age dropped perhaps from 22 to 14 or 16. The 
few leaders who remained enjoyed absolute 
authority over their unquestioning ranks and 
individuals who joined were severely changed 
by the nature of the organization. 
The Growth of the L.T.T.E
In reprisal for the killing by Sri Lankan forces 
of 70 Tamil civilians in Valvettithurai and the 
damage caused to the homes of Prabhakaran 
and several other L.T.T.E. leaders, the L.T.T.E. 
on 14 May 1985 inflicted what came to be 
known as the “Anuradhapura massacre”. A few 
L.T.T.E. men drove into Anuradhapura and 
gunned down about 150 persons with ruthless 
efficiency and got away. 
Around January 1986, it was a general belief 
among Tamils that no single group could 
proceed alone against the might of the Sri 
Lankan army. Attacks by the Sri Lankan 
Army in early 1986 on an L.T.T.E. camp at 
Suthumalai and a subsequent thrust into 
Tellipallai, were repulsed by all groups acting 
together, including the T.E.A. The T.E.L.O. 
provided critical help in saving the day when 
troops landed by helicopter and attacked 
the L.T.T.E.'s camp at Suthumalai. This was 
publicly acknowledged by the L.T.T.E. 
However, by December 1986 the L.T.T.E. 
became the dominant militant group, 
after having alienated and disbanded  the 
other militant groups. Its military task as 
a result became much heavier, and it faced 
a severe manpower shortage. Under these 
circumstances the L.T.T.E. was encouraging 
recruits even in their early teens. Jaffna's Old 
Park had now become a show case for the 
L.T.T.E., where children watched the drilling 
going on after school and would sometimes 
run away from homes to join. Others might 
first join their friends who were on sentry duty 
and later join fully for the thrill of it. By mid-
1987 girls too were being trained for a military 
role.
It had been rumoured for some time that the 
"Das faction" of the T.E.L.O. in Vadamaratchi 
had some differences with the leader Sri 
Sabaratnam. Das was an able military man -- 
and this faction was said to form the military 
backbone of the T.E.L.O. The L.T.T.E.'s 
opportunity came when in April 1986 the 
Bobby faction of the T.E.L.O. treacherously 
shot dead Das and 4 of his colleagues. They 
were shot dead while visiting a colleague in 
the Jaffna Hospital. This resulted in the Das 
faction leaving the T.E.L.O. and going into 
exile, considerably weakening the T.E.L.O. 
Towards the end of the month the T.E.L.O. 
moved several of its men outside Jaffna, 
ostensibly for operations against the Sri 
Lankan army. At the same time the L.T.T.E. 
moved many of its men into Jaffna and the

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
70
word was put out that it was going to attack 
one of the Sri Lankan encampments. 
A crucial advantage possessed by the L.T.T.E. 
was a modern communications system with 
wireless sets. The L.T.T.E. took on the T.E.L.O. 
at the end of that month. The pretext was a 
minor tiff arising from both groups calling for 
a hartal for the men they had lost at sea, about 
the same time. After one week of fighting the 
L.T.T.E. was supreme in Jaffna. The T.E.L.O. 
leader Sri Sabaratnam was killed on 7 May. 
The manner in which the T.E.L.O. members 
were killed, shocked Tamil people everywhere. 
Twelve were killed near Manipay while they 
were asleep. Several caught unaware were 
shot and burnt at junctions at Thirunelvely, 
Mallakam, and Tellipallai. Eight persons 
were killed at the camp behind the St. John's 
principal's bungalow. One person was thrust 
into a car, which was exploded, leaving severed 
limbs strewn around. Many of the T.E.L.O. 
members from areas outside Jaffna had to flee 
in fear without knowing the streets or where 
they were going. The people were so terrified, 
that few found the courage to give shelter to 
the fugitives. While this unprecedented display 
was on, people stood mutely at junctions 
and watched, as persons hardly dead, were 
doused and burnt. Hardly anyone protested, 
out of fear.. Some students at the University 
attempted to take out a procession to stop 
the fighting but had to abandon it. The 
fighting was over in less than a week and Sri 
Sabaratnam was killed in circumstances which 
are not clear.
A similar circumstance preceded the L.T.T.E.'s 
taking on the E.P.R.L.F. seven months later 
- namely, the split arising from differences 
between Padmanabha, the E.P.R.L.F.'s political 
leader and Douglas Devananda, the leader of 
its military wing.
 Following the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash, the 
L.T.T.E. began to play on the fears of ordinary 
people. Loudspeaker vehicles went about 
telling people not to talk about or analyse 
what had happened. This was the first publicly 
announced act of censorship. Previously the 
L.T.T.E. and the T.E.L.O. especially had visited 
newspapers to tell them not to write about 
certain incidents.
An aspect of L.T.T.E. dominance that made 
it acceptable to the general public was that 
robberies virtually ceased. The poor and the 
middle classes were left alone. The L.T.T.E. 
made mutually beneficial arrangements with 
wholesale merchants and big businessmen 
to the satisfaction of the latter. They could 
now enjoy their profits without the nuisance 
of being occasionally kidnapped for 
ransom. Before May 1986, if a man allegedly 
committed a fraud, the first militant group to 
discover it would descend on him, most likely 
in the night, to carry out an investigation. 
Occasionally, the victim would be lamp-posted 
(shot after being tied to a lamp post), or would 
be let off after negotiating an appropriate fee.  
It was now expected that the L.T.T.E. would 
soon make a bid for sole dominance amongst 
the Tamil Militant Groups.
Arunagirinathan Vijitharan was a third-year 
commerce student from the University of 
Jaffna who was generally unknown until he 
was missing from his boarding house on 4 
November 1986. An action committee was 
formed by the students. They did not accuse 
anyone. They simply maintained that the four 
functioning militant groups were responsible 
for the security of persons in Jaffna. Further, 
they had sentries everywhere, making it 
unlikely those persons could disappear 
without their knowledge. The militant groups 
were called upon to do their acknowledged 
duty and restore Vijitharan. Privately, the 
students admitted that they were afraid and 
were in no mood to confront any militant

71
group. On the other hand, the students felt 
that if they kept quiet, the chance of students 
disappearing one by one was greater. Not 
having received a satisfying response, the 
students commenced a campaign of fasting on 
19 November in which six persons, both boys 
and girls began a fast in a temporary cadjan 
shed in front of the administration block.
At this point many diverse opinions came 
to be expressed, most of them agreeing that 
the students should give up their fast. Some 
felt that the students were performing a very 
necessary task; but the community did not 
deserve the deaths of those who were fasting. 
If they died, six prospective leaders would be 
lost while people would shrug their shoulders 
and go on as before. Some were hostile. They 
thought that the Tamils were being divided 
in the face of the main enemy, the Sri Lankan 
state, when they should be uniting behind the 
L.T.T.E. 
The Jaffna press played it diplomatically by 
giving equal prominence to statements by all 
parties. The E.P.R.L.F. backed the students. The 
E.R.O.S. characteristically sat on the fence. The 
students were painfully aware that their protest 
could become interpreted as anti-L.T.T.E. 
and backed by rival militant groups who did 
not wish to confront the L.T.T.E. directly. A 
speech delivered by an E.P.R.L.F. leader at 
the University, the contents of which did not 
receive prior approval from the students, gave 
further room for this impression.
There was strong pressure on the students to 
give up the protest, and the L.T.T.E. too was 
embarrassed by it. But the problem was how 
to end it. A mutually acceptable formula had 
to be found. Even admirers of the protest 
felt that it had gone on long enough and 
that no further purpose would be served by 
its prolongation. A number of persons and 
organisations came to patch up a settlement, 
including the University Teachers' Association 
(U.T.A.). 
Eventually a formula for ending the fast was 
reached. For the University students, it ended 
for the time being their role in public affairs. 
With all their weaknesses and drawbacks, 
their role had been a noble one. They had been 
forced into tasks where others more mature 
and experienced than they ought to have been 
given the lead. For the Tamil people, another 
light had gone out. Vimaleswaran, the student 
leader who led the protest fast, paid a heavy 
price for his defiance of the new order. He was 
assassinated in July, 1988.
The natural defiance of the women remained 
a remarkable feature. Village women in the 
East went out with rice pounders to stop 
the internecine fighting during the L.T.T.E.-
T.E.L.O. clash. When the L.T.T.E. took on the 
E.P.R.L.F. on 14 December 1986, women from 
some villages in Jaffna near Keerimalai and 
Mallakam defied the L.T.T.E. by sitting on the 
roads armed with kitchen knives and chillie 
powder.    
Differences among the Militants   
The public had up to now thought of the 
L.T.T.E. as a monolith. But in the second half 
of 1986 differences, rivalries and personal 
ambitions within the L.T.T.E. which had a 
politics of its own began to surface and were 
talked about. Sources with good connections 
talked of differences between the Jaffna 
leader, Kittu and the then Vavuniya leader 
Mahattaya. The latter is said to have felt that 
those in Jaffna were being spoilt by glamour 
and a relatively easy life. Following the events 
of May 1986 several senior L.T.T.E. men left 
the group. One of them was Kandeepan who 
was in charge of the Islands. After leaving the 
organization he simply stayed in his home

at Ariyalai without wanting to see any of his 
former colleagues. The L.T.T.E. apparently 
wished to talk to him in order to persuade him 
to rejoin. Kandeepan was a competent military 
man who had pioneered the use of sea-
mines. The lower ranks had been reportedly 
disoriented by the departure of several senior 
men. After refusing to see Kittu on two 
occasions the third time he was surrounded 
in order to force a meeting. But Kandeepan 
ran into his house and swallowed cyanide. 
The L.T.T.E. delayed the confirmation of his 
death and forced the family to perform the last 
rites in the early hours of the morning. Before 
his death Kandeepan had complained to one 
of his old friends that during the clash with 
the T.E.L.O., his organisation had promptly 
sent reinforcements to the Islands. But when 
the Sri Lankan government made an attempt 
on Mandaitivu, Kandeepan had submitted a 
plan which only required a modest quantity 
of arms. The organization had not, he had 
complained, responded to this request. 
On 14 December, 1986, the E.P.R.L.F., the 
P.L.O.T.E. and the T.E.A. were disbanded by 
the L.T.T.E. In the Northern Province the 
E.P.R.L.F. fled its camps without a fight. Several 
E.P.R.L.F. leaders were arrested by the LTTE 
and many of them were tortured in order to 
make them disclose locations of hidden arms. 
The L.T.T.E. men were trained to carry out 
orders from the top blindly. There is no doubt 
that the other groups displayed the same kind 
of obedience when facing the Sri Lankan army. 
But when it came to an open confrontation 
with a fellow militant group, the other groups 
seem to have been handicapped by a certain 
amount of reluctance and confusion. There 
was a definite inhibition when it came to 
killing fellow Tamils. An observer living close 
to the E.P.R.L.F. camp at Uduvil said that there 
was a split amongst the ranks as to whether 
they should go in for a bloody fratricidal 
confrontation with the L.T.T.E. or simply go 
into hiding. Before this could be resolved, the 
L.T.T.E. came and caught them unprepared. 
This left them with no option but to disperse. 
Like the split in the T.E.L.O. which the L.T.T.E. 
took advantage of, this time a split in the 
E.P.R.L.F between Douglas Devananda, the 
leader of its military wing, and the leadership 
under Padmanabha was a chance the L.T.T.E. 
had been waiting for. 
The P.L.O.T.E. in Jaffna, disbanded by  the 
LTTE, had a political programme which 
emphasized work amongst the masses. These 
combined to give it an image in certain 
quarters of a disciplined organisation in 
dealings with the people. The P.L.O.T.E., 
however, had suffered discredit as a result of 
internal killings from at least two gruesome 
incidents in Jaffna. Five of its own women 
cadres were killed by members of the 
P.L.O.T.E. at Maniamthoddam, Jaffna, in 1985. 
Also in early 1985, seven L.T.T.E. sympathizers 
who were putting up posters in Chullipuram, 
were badly tortured and killed by P.L.O.T.E. 
men under Kandasamy (Chankili). At the 
same time, the P.L.O.T.E. cadre in Jaffna did 
earn the respect of the population for the 
sentry work it did around army encampments. 
It used its training to advance towards Jaffna 
Fort, along K.K.S. Road behind a barrier of 
advancing sand bags. Its men crawled through 
drains and other cover to install land mines 
fairly close to Jaffna Fort. When hints were 
given that the P.L.O.T.E. was to be disbanded 
the P.L.O.T.E. sentries withdrew from Jaffna 
town exploding their land mines. 
By this time the L.T.T.E. in Jaffna, under Kittu, 
had established friendly personal relations 
with Captain Kotelawala of the Sri Lankan 
army and leading personalities amongst the 
Sinhalese, such as Vijaya Kumaranatunga, 
Vincent Perera and the Rev. Fr. Yohan 
Devananda. Kittu and his deputy Raheem 
became celebrated personalities in the South.

The L.T.T.E. and the government gave the 
impression that a move for a negotiated 
settlement was on. A set of proposals, called 
the December 19th proposals, which had been 
drafted with India's help were announced 
by the Sri Lankan government on the 26th 
of December for discussion. The L.T.T.E. 
announced that it was taking over the civil 
administration of Jaffna from 1 January 1987, 
although in practice this could have made little 
difference. The government announced a fuel 
and firewood blockade on Jaffna. Prabhakaran 
moved to Jaffna in early January 1987. The 
crisis had entered a new phase.
The Eastern Question
By 1985 youths from districts in the Northern 
Province outside Jaffna and from the Eastern 
Province which had been ravaged by Sri 
Lankan military action which included 
massacres, were playing a numerically 
dominant role in the militant groups. 
Unlike the articulate youth of Jaffna who 
had joined in the early 1980's because of 
ideals of national liberation and a feeling of 
collective humiliation, these rural youths had 
been subject to some harrowing first hand 
experiences. By the end of 1985, those of the 
Tamil residents of Trincomalee district outside 
the city who were alive, had become displaced. 
The L.T.T.E. leader Pulendran, is said to have 
seen most of his family killed by Sri Lankan 
forces before his eyes. In such a situation 
the killing and counter-killing of Tamil and 
Sinhalese civilians became the order of the day. 
Yet the leadership of the militant movement 
was mainly Jaffna-dominated. The majority 
amongst the T.E.L.O. youths killed in May 
1986 were from the rural areas. The E.P.R.L.F. 
continued to be active in the Batticaloa district 
after it was wound down in Jaffna in December 
1986.
 One factor which distinguished the militant 
movement in the East was that ideological and 
group differences were over-ridden by a feeling 
that they were all Eastern Province Tamils 
united through the experience of common 
suffering, who must stand together or perish. 
Group differences mattered far less than in 
Jaffna. Often, they shared camps and meals. 
When the L.T.T.E. was given orders by radio 
to go for the T.E.L.O. in May 1986, the killings 
in the East were far fewer than in Jaffna. At 
Sambur, according to a T.E.L.O. source in 
Trincomalee, T.E.L.O. members who were 
having a meal were called out by members of 
the L.T.T.E. who had been erstwhile friends. 
The T.E.L.O. men were unaware of such 
orders having been given and went out as if 
to meet friends, when their leader and two 
others were killed. At Sambaltivu, according 
to a Trincomalee resident, women went out 
with rice pounders to ensure that there was 
no killing. This was in contrast to suburban 
Jaffna where people watched mutely during 
the killings. However, during December 1986 
when the L.T.T.E. went after the E.P.R.L.F., 
some villagers in rural Jaffna protected the 
E.P.R.L.F. cadre by blocking the roads, armed 
with knives and chillie powder.
The E.P.R.L.F. had begun to prove itself 
effective against the dreaded S.T.F. (Special 
Task Force). It had just carried out a series of 
successful landmine attacks against the S.T.F., 
thus restricting its movement. The L.T.T.E.'s 
protracted battle with the E.P.R.L.F. opened 
the field to the S.T.F. A consequence of these 
developments and the desperate plight of 
Tamils of the East, was that leaders of the 
Eastern Tamils were generally amenable to 
a settlement on the basis of the December 
19th proposals which envisaged separate 
provincial councils for the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces. The powers devolved in 
policing and land settlement were generally 
deemed inadequate, but were the subject

of negotiation. In Jaffna which 
was relatively secure, a more 
hawkish mood prevailed, backed 
by L.T.T.E. propaganda, an 
enfeebled press and a section of 
the articulate intelligentsia. Those 
in Jaffna who felt that the Tamils, 
now dangerously weakened, must 
in the common interest use India's 
good offices to negotiate the best 
possible settlement, sometimes 
found through experience 
that they should not express 
themselves too loudly. Inevitably 
there arose a widespread feeling 
amongst Eastern Tamils, that the 
Jaffna based Tamil leadership had 
failed them. The Eastern Province 
Tamils will in the years to come 
have to resolve the question of 
their dealings with Northern 
Tamils and their relations with Muslims and 
Sinhalese in the East, whom they have for 
neighbours. 
Examples of killings of Tamils by Tamils 
drawn from UTHR reports 
Mr. Vimalesweren — 25 years old - a 
student leader. 18th July 1988
Vimalesweren’s name came into prominence 
when he led the last great campaign for 
fundamental rights by the students of Jaffna 
University in November 1986. The occasion 
was the disappearance of the student 
Vijitharan when the LTTE was the controlling 
power. The protest attracted large crowds, and 
Vimalesweren was one of the six students who 
went on a fast. Kittu spoke to Vimalesweren, 
but conceded nothing. Vimalesweren then 
said that there could be no reconciliation 
without a change of heart and a new approach. 
It occurred against a background of much 
popular sentiment for the LTTE as the physical 
defender of the Tamils. The protest was called 
off after ten days. A compromise was reached 
and the LTTE undertook not to harm the 
protesters.
Within about a fortnight the LTTE launched 
a campaign to suppress the E.P.R.L.F. which 
had also supported the students’ protest. The 
P.L.O.T.E. had, by then, voluntarily ceased 
functioning.
Vimalesweren remained with peasants in 
Jaffna, who gave him protection for nearly 
a year. He sat for his Examination and lived 
with his wife in Chavakacheri, in order that he 
could earn a living by giving tutorials in Jaffna. 
On the afternoon of 18th July an assassin shot 
him dead as he came out of a tutorial in Nallur 
after finishing a teaching assignment. The 
same evening it was reported that two gunmen 
had entered the University of Jaffna, and had 
left after walking about for some minutes. The 
message to the students was clear.

During this period there had been much 
speculation about the disappearance of Mr. K. 
Kanthasamy on 19th June 1988. Kanthasamy 
was a leading Company Lawyer who had 
dedicated himself to refugee rehabilitation 
and human rights work. On the 12th July 
1988, six days before Vimalesweren’s death, 
the Murasoli (one of two daily newspapers in 
Jaffna) published a statement with the front-
page headline: “Kanthasamy cannot hereafter 
be seen - claims the Pasarai group”. 
Mr. Vaithilingam Paramanathan - a 
community leader: 1st October 1988
Mr. Paramanathan was a community leader 
from Myliddy. At 10.30 p.m. on the night of 
1st October 1988 some youths came to his 
house and called him out. Though cautioned 
by his wife, Paramanthan went out saying 
that he recognised one youth as a person he 
had sheltered. A little later a shot was heard. 
Within a short time, neighbours came out 
and Paramanthan’s body was found. Angry 
villagers proceeded to barricade access roads 
into the village.
Saverimuttu Anton Douglas — 33 years 
old - Delft Island. 4th October 1988
 “On 4th October 1988 Anton was walking 
when he was pointed out by ‘B’ to two 
members of the (identity redacted) at about 
1.00 pm. My husband Saverimuttu (65 yrs.) 
who later went in search of him found him 
tied to a Palmyra tree with his arms stretched 
around the trunk. The two (identity redacted) 
boys, identified as Kutti and Injur, were 
bludgeoning him mercilessly with poles. 
Anton was seen to be in a pretty bad state. 
My husband went up to our son, hugged him, 
and pleaded with his attackers. He was given 
a whack with a pole and chased away. The 
attackers asked him to come back with the 
arms his son had hidden. My husband went 
back at about 4.00 PM and found our son 
and his attackers missing. It has now been 
surmised that Anton had died of the beating 
he received and was then buried. I heard 
that his attackers too subsequently died in 
action. Injur is said to have been the leader 
for the seven islands. I am told that he died in 
Karainagar in late November.”
Justin Thevaraiah (‘Thevan’) - 19 yrs old 
- Chundukuli.  12th October 1988
The reason for Thevan’s killing is not clear. 
Thevan personally had no compromising 
connections. An assassin shot him dead near 
Rakka Road junction, leaving his fallen body 
in a pool of blood. His assassin is said to have 
been a young man who put his weapon back 
into his shoulder bag and fled. 
Incident at Iddaikadu - Killings of 
Kasilingam Sivasubramaniam (40 yr) 
and Kanapathipillai Velmurugan (42 yrs).  
18th October 1988
Sivasubramaniam was a resident of Iddaikadu, 
near the army base at Palaly. During the 
time the Sri Lankan army was active, 
Sivasubramaniam and his family used to help 
the (identity redacted) with food and shelter. 
On the night of 18th October 1988, at about 
10.30 PM, gunmen entered his house and 
attempted to drag him out. His brother-in-
law, Velmurugan, went up to him and hugged 
him, pleading and crying. The gunmen first 
shot Velmurugan in the head. They then shot 
Sivasubramaniam and went away.
Sivasubramaniam and his wife Sivarani (36 
yrs.) had two daughters and two sons: Kayalvili 
(14), Yalini (12), Sivaseelan (9) and Dwarakan

(2). Velmurugan and his wife Parameswari 
(35) had a son and four daughters: Ganeshavel 
(13), Chitra (12), Subathira and Susnithira 
(twins, aged 8) and Sarithira (6).
The call for introspection
M. A Sumanthiran PC in parliament on 
December 3rd 2013 was reported to have said 
amongst many other matters, ‘I would also 
urge the Tamil people to use this opportunity 
for the long-needed introspection.  Where 
did we go wrong?  Was the Jaffna Youth 
Congress wrong in boycotting the elections 
in 1931 insisting on poorna swaraj?  Were 
our leaders wrong in rejecting the demand 
for federalism put forward by the Kandyan 
League to two imperial commissions? Was 
G G Ponnambalam wrong in calling for 50-
50?  And then supporting the Government 
after the passage of the Indian-Pakistani 
Citizenship Act?  Was S J V Chelvanayakam 
wrong in calling for a federal state in 1951 and 
for a separate state in 1976?  Were the leaders 
of the TULF wrong in accepting the District 
Development Council in 1981 and then not 
accepting the Provincial Council system 
in 1987?  Were the Tamil political leaders 
complicit in the emergence of an armed 
struggle?
How can we then drag ourselves out of this 
quagmire and get on with our lives for the 
future?  I suggest that we do this firstly by 
being honest with each other.  Both sides must 
acknowledge that we did terrible things to 
each other, not just during the last stages of 
the war, not just during the 30-year period of 
violent struggle, but even before that.’
I argue we have had a terrible sequence of 
missteps since 1948 leading to a long period 
of conflict with ebbs and flows resulting in 
grotesque violation of human rights. I recall 
efforts of Neelan Tiruchelvam, Wilson, 
Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Committee 
Tamil National Alliance, Geneva
Thursday, 17 September 2015  
 
 TNA Lawmaker and Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily FT at the Palais des Nations 
in Geneva that the party hoped the Government would accept the UN report. 
 
Sri Lanka must now stand up and accept this report and work with the world community. 
To that extent, we ask the 47 Member States in the Human Rights Council to adopt all the 
recommendations in the OISL report as a resolution. We ask the Government of Sri Lanka 
to agree to that so that we can go forward with one aim. To deal with the past properly, in 
a manner that will assuage the feelings of the victims and having dealt with the past in a 
meaningful way to move forward into a bright future for all of Sri Lanka’s people,” the TNA 
Parliamentarian urged. 
 
We also accept and undertake to carry out our responsibility to lead the Tamil people in 
reflecting on the past, and use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own 
community’s failures and the unspeakable crimes committed in our name, so as to create an 
enabling culture and atmosphere in which we could live with dignity and self-respect, as equal 
citizens of Sri Lanka.

Reports of the APRC (Yogarajan and Nizam 
Kariapper), and Mangala Moonesinghe 
Reports, the Sansoni and LLRC Commission 
reports and Reconciliation Policy during the 
Yahapalanya Government to bring a lasting 
settlement. 
Since the 1977 Constitutional feature for parity 
of languages and the 13th amendment in 1987 
and the Official Languages Commission Act 
has a single word or line been added to either 
our Constitution or in Legislation which are 
legislatives firewalls equalising rights of all 
communities in Sri Lanka notwithstanding the 
colossal cost in ‘trying’?  What does that say?
In this history Tamils must have the courage 
to look inwards and stand tall. The law 
demands every homicide or disappearance be 
uncovered. The examples of killings cited in 
this piece is a miniscule fraction of the total. 
How in heavens name can we not look at our 
past littered with grotesque abuses against 
our own people by us? E.g. there is a woman 
who brought up two girls and a boy with 
extraordinary hardship after her husband was 
summoned, interned and killed by a group 
on suspicion of being an informer. She was 
handed a watch and his wedding ring. Many 
parents and siblings silently grieve, when 
possible, by graves and tomb stones. 
 It is galling that hundreds of children 
were conscripted and forcibly turned into 
combatants. Many of whom never came 
back home. They can neither be found in 
either marked or unmarked graves. We 
cannot even estimate the number of children 
taken away in such manner. We have lived 
with this knowledge from the mid 70’s. It is 
unacceptable to imagine we could ignore the 
elephant in the room. We should have the 
courage to take responsibility for our crimes 
on our people and listen to the testimonies of 
the survivors.
The world is replete with the ‘how’ to do 
so. The elements that should go into such 
processes have been mentioned here. There 
are very many more to consider.  The manner 
in which a society decides to deal with past 
violations of human rights determines the 
extent to which long-term stability and 
reconciliation may be achieved. Interventions 
should aim to prevent the recurrence of 
conflicts while repairing the damage caused. 
As Governor of Northern Province for 18 
months I was acutely conscious of what had 
preceded 1983 when I started work, including 
behind the Governor’s residence in a network 
of bunkers. Suma was right in asking we look 
inwards. It is by no means an easy task. A 
task very necessary if we the Tamils were to 
take high ground and ask ‘others’ to account 
for their foul deeds and acts of omission 
and commission. It is painful and can have 
uncontrollable consequences if handled 
poorly. 
What is horrifyingly sad is that the Soulbury 
Commission brilliantly and wisely analysed 
what was wrong with us and in under 10 years 
(1956) we started sliding. The rest is history. 
A history we cannot erase however hard it is 
tried.
The Tamils need to feel a part of the nation, 
and if there are insufficient policies and laws to 
strengthen the confidence of the minorities in 
Sri Lanka, then a separatist agenda or violence 
will only flourish in future and could again 
entail violence within the Tamil community 
itself. It thus fundamental for governments 
to take steps to prevent at all cost any future 
relapse to violence and measures which are 
legislative, policy and in practice to achieve the 
highest form of tolerance, accommodation and 
democratic rule much in the manner set out 
by the Soulbury Commission and the LLRC.
