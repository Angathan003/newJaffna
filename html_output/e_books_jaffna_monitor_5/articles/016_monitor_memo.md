his is a happy evening for all of us. We have 
met many evenings in our life’s journey. 
Many more await. Many evenings past may 
rekindle sweet memories in your mind. Perhaps 
you got married one evening. Perhaps you 
met your soulmate for the first time in another. 
Perhaps you gave birth to your firstborn in yet 
another.
I remember clearly. He was born twenty-seven 
years ago on an evening during the waxing

moon. Someone brought the news to his 
father, who was plowing my land. I remember 
very well when he came before me with a 
wide grin and said, “Nayinār, I have been 
blessed with a son. I need to go home.” I 
remember that when I responded, “What if 
your son was just born? Are you the doctor 
taking care of him? Finish the work before 
you leave,” his face fell. Unable to bear that 
sight, I remember telling him, “Go, go,” and 
sending him off.
Now I am sixty years old. My hair has turned 
gray. My voice has faltered. The experience 
of maturity has creased on my face. I now 
understand people, their desires, and their 
ideals about what constitutes a worthy life. But 
back then, I did not have the same maturity. I 
was a fearless buck in those days, blessed with 
enormous wealth and accustomed to being 
treated like a lord….; I regret wasting those 
precious days. How much drama did I create! 
How many atrocities did I commit! How many 
lives did I destroy!
You might find it strange that I myself 
recount negatives about me. But I am not at 
all ashamed to do so. On the contrary, I think 
it is entirely appropriate that I talk about 
them. Many of you are educated, hold good 
positions, and are savvy enough to understand 
the duplicity, dishonesty, and selfishness that 
lie hidden beneath the facade of the great and 
the good; Many of you gullible innocents – 
hard workers; Many of you grew stronger 
because of your constant struggle with life. 
It is just fitting that all of you learn how a 
man who lived a flawed life was sainted. 
But I don’t want to make you weary on this 
occasion by delving into these topics at length.
It was yet another evening when he came to 
see me. It must have been a Saturday. I had 
had an oil bath, had a drink before my lunch, 
and had just woken up from my post-lunch 
siesta. It was a lethargic dusk. I was sitting 
on the recliner in my front yard, staring at the 
eastern horizon. I was plotting to take revenge 
on someone or the other, root them out, and 
drive them away from their home.
It was then that he came to see me. He leaned 
his bicycle on the jasmine bush in the front 
yard and walked over to stand next to me. He 
was wearing a white vētti and a white shirt. He 
had a budding pencil mustache. His face was 
serene, sporting a smile that would instantly 
disarm anyone.
All of you know him very well. I need not 
describe his appearance at length. But I cannot 
forget my first meeting with him that drowsy 
evening, as my drunken stupor was subsiding. 
Although I had seen him on many occasions 
prior, the meeting that day is memorable 
because that was the first time I spoke to him; 
It was that meeting that drew me to him and 
his convictions. I started to transform into a 
human being only after that meeting.
I keep talking about myself. While his 
memories bubble forth in your minds, I think 
it is inevitable that I recall my memories of 
interacting with him. On this happy occasion, 
I think it is fitting, and is, in a way, a tribute to 
him.
That evening, when he met me, he started 
his conversation by greeting me with a 
“Vaṇakkam,” first. I didn’t return his greeting. 
I didn’t even invite him to sit down. I had 
a certain arrogance back then. I was the 
honorary chairperson of all the sundry clubs 
and societies in the village. Whatever I had 
heard of him until that day was not exactly 
palatable to me. I regarded him with distaste.
He did not seem to mind my ill treatment. He 
said, with the same constant smile, “I want to 
discuss a few matters with aiyā.”

It was probably around that time that he 
devised the plans for a road running right 
through the village, from the northern end 
of our village to the main street in the south. 
As I listened quietly, he started speaking. 
From beginning to end, he explained very 
clearly and in detail. It was as if he saw the 
road in his mind’s eye and was relishing the 
experience of walking along the road. He 
spoke as though he was in a trance.
There is a lump in my throat when I say this. 
From your faces, I can see your sorrow, too. I 
can hear someone sobbing. Many of you are 
wiping your eyes. Even though his memories 
bring out your sadness, you must be happy to 
see his dream come true. You must not grieve 
as if there has been an irreparable loss or 
destruction because you know that he would 
not want that.
Back then, by crook or by hook, I owned 
half the land in this village. I inherited all 
that from my father. I was the master of my 
domain, the king of my hill. I laid down the 
law. I was at the pinnacle of my reign when 
he came to see me. He talked at length about 
the road he wanted to build, a road that will 
rip through my lands. I was mesmerized, 
listening with rapt attention as he held forth.
He spoke logically. He explained what 
righteous living is. He showed me the sorrows 
of people who struggle, explaining the lengths 
to which the residents of the high ground 
in my lands were forced to go to, in order 
to fetch just a pot of water. When he said, 
“This suffering is not permanent; It should be 
removed; It can be removed; Think of how 
elated the people would be when this suffering 
is removed!” I was engrossed in what he was

saying, oblivious to everything 
else.
I remembered the face of his 
father who came before me 
with a wide grin on hearing the 
news of his birth. I remembered 
the faces of the naive, innocent 
village folk who lauded me as 
the ‘big-hearted farmer’ when 
I used government funding 
to dig a community well in 
my property under the guise 
of helping the high-ground 
residents.
I marvel even now. I couldn’t 
understand how my distaste and 
hatred simply evaporated when 
he started speaking. It cannot 
be said that I was delighted by 
his speech simply because I 
was in a drunken stupor. What 
was compelling for anyone was 
his speech, the thread of logic 
that ran through his speech, and 
his deep regard for his fellow 
human beings that made him 
strive to remove their suffering. 
Occasionally I compared him 
with great leaders like Vinobha, 
Gandhi, or Lenin. I am sure 
you will not disagree that 
the comparison is warranted. 
In truth, he would have 
blossomed into a leader who 
charts the course towards the 
emancipation of the suffering 
masses.
I know very well that 
wallowing in the memory of 
past sorrows is futile. But how 
can we forget his memories just 
because they are past?
I am blabbering at length. But I won’t have another occasion 
to share these thoughts with you. I hear that many of you 
laud me as some great philanthropist. I am no philanthropist 
nor saint but just an ordinary human. I am an ordinary man 
who went from lacking humanity to being a person with 
love for his fellow humans. When he made me discover my 
humanity, I spent a big chunk of my wealth for the common 
good. I gave away a part of my landholdings for this road. 
The target of your gratitude for all of this should be him.
In a sense, I know that asserting ownership over one’s assets 
is wrong. He said that if a person owns more than they need, 
then the excess should be made public property. He would 
assert angrily that those people who appropriate nature’s 
wealth for themselves when millions of people struggle 
without food, clothing, or the means to live a full life, are 
the scoundrels of society. He would declare that there would 
come a time when everyone would live with fulfillment, and 
that we were going to strive to bring it into fruition.
I sense a bustle among you. I don’t want to stand for long 
between you and the others who are waiting to speak. I am 
deeply honored to have been invited to give the keynote

address on this occasion of declaring this 
new road open. But my speech would not be 
complete if I didn’t share a little more about 
his struggle for making this road a reality. 
You are now going to walk along this road. 
This road that cuts through palmyra patches, 
farming lands, shrubs, and small settlements, 
will become useful to you. Many of your 
inconveniences will be removed. Now you 
don’t have to walk a mile-and-a-half to post a 
letter. You can put your letter into the little red 
box that hangs on a roadside pole. Pregnant 
women need not be carried over to the main 
road but can be driven to the hospital directly. 
He was the one who saw your travails and 
dreamed up ways to address them. He was the 
one who planned them, worked for them, and 
ultimately sacrificed his own life for them.
This beautiful curving road cuts through the 
village. Those of you who are old enough will 
remember it when it was just a footpath. It was 
strewn with spurges and thorny shrubs with 
black claws that would grab you. He toiled by

himself to broaden the footpath to pave the 
way for the road. Eventually a handful of other 
youngsters his age joined him. He was injured 
at the spot where the mailbox stands now. He 
ignored it because it was a small scratch.
I am obliged to tell you what he told me 
when his injury became serious. His last 
message to me and you was this: “I will not 
survive aiyā…,” (from the beginning till the 
very end, he called me “aiyā”) “please tell 
everyone that my death will not mean the 
end of this pilgrimage towards the salvation 
of our people. Tell them that the journey will 
continue until its goal is reached. Tell them 
that until every person in this world has the 
opportunity to live a happy, full life, this 
journey will not end.”
When I heard this word, I teared up. Your eyes 
would tear up, too. No matter how strong we 
are, some occasions call for crying.
