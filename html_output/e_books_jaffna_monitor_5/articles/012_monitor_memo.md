n a move to enhance air connectivity 
between India and Sri Lanka, a 
delegation from Indigo Airlines met with 
N.Vethanayagan, Governor of the Northern 
Province, last week to discuss plans for 
launching direct flights between Bangalore and 
Jaffna.
The discussions, described as “highly 
productive” by both parties, highlighted the 
growing demand for travel between the two 
cities. Indigo, which already operates flights 
between Chennai and Jaffna, is now eyeing 
the Bangalore-Jaffna route to cater to the 
increasing number of passengers, including 
over 25,000 annual travelers who make the 
journey for pilgrimage purposes.
The airline made history in September 2024 
by becoming the second Indian carrier to 
launch Chennai-Jaffna flights, offering a swift 
75-minute journey that has since gained 
popularity among travelers.
The proposed Bangalore-Jaffna route is 
expected to further strengthen cultural, 
economic, and tourism ties between the two 
regions. With Jaffna’s rich cultural heritage and 
its significance as a pilgrimage destination, 
the new flight route could unlock greater 
opportunities for trade, tourism, and people-
to-people connections.
Governor Vethanayagam expressed optimism 
about the potential benefits of the new route, 
stating, “Enhanced air connectivity will not 
only boost tourism but also foster stronger ties 
between the people of India and Sri Lanka, 
particularly the Tamil communities in both 
nations.”
If finalized, the Bangalore-Jaffna route is 
expected to provide a significant boost to the 
Northern Province’s economy, which has been 
steadily recovering and rebuilding in the post-
war era.
