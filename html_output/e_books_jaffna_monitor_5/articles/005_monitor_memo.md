T
he Tamil journalism community in 
Sri Lanka is mourning the loss of 
Rajanayagam Bharathi, who passed away on 
February 9 at the age of 63. More than just 
a veteran reporter, Bharathi was a driving 
force in Tamil media—a fearless advocate 
for his colleagues, a mentor to numerous 
young journalists, and a lifelong champion of 
journalistic integrity.
His career began in the turbulent 1980s with 
Eezhamurasu, and over the next four decades, 
his byline became a fixture in nearly every 
major Tamil publication in the country. From 
Murasoli to Thinakkural, EelaNadu, and 
most notably, Virakesari—where he served as 
Northern Regional Editor until his passing—
Bharathi fearlessly documented the Tamil 
liberation struggle, the atrocities committed by 
the armed forces, and other critical issues.
Colleagues remember his unwavering bravery, 
particularly in his reporting on the abduction 
and killing of Murasoli editor Thiruchelvam’s 
son, Ahilan—a crime allegedly orchestrated 
by a former death squad leader who now 
parades as a champion of Tamil nationalism, 
cloaked in self-righteousness, claiming that 
he wouldn’t harm even an ant, not even in his 
dreams.
His colleagues recall that Bharathi faced 
numerous death threats for his relentless 
coverage of Ahilan’s brutal murder, yet he 
refused to be silenced, standing firm in his 
commitment to truth and justice.
Bharathi’s influence extended far beyond the 
written word. As a founding member and 
leader of the Tamil Journalists' Union, he was 
a tireless advocate for press freedom and the 
rights of his peers. More than that, he was 
a mentor and guide, shaping generations of 
aspiring journalists with his gentle demeanor, 
sharp editorial acumen, and unwavering 
dedication to ethical reporting.
His passing leaves a void that will be deeply 
felt across the media fraternity. 
Jaffna Monitor extends its deepest condolences 
to his family, friends, and colleagues whose 
lives he touched. He will be deeply missed.
