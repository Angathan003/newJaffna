W
e now shift our 
focus on some 
of the frontline artists 
who have nurtured the 
nathaswaram and thavil in 
Sri Lanka through the 60s and 
70s to the present day – the key 
objective of this series of articles.
  
Frontline Thavil artists in 
Sri Lanka: Nathaswaram recitals 
(referred to as ‘Kucheries or fr;Nrup) 
usually begins with a section dedicated to 
the thavil performance. This period sets in the 
ambience and the tempo which then seamlessly 
blends into the ragas and melodies that flows 
from the nathaswaram. The essential attributes 
of the thavil players are a deep understanding of 
the rhythmic cycles (‘Thalam’ or jhsk;) and the 
different percussive expressions that may be fitted 
into each rhythmic cycle. The rhythmic cycles 
may be performed at different speeds which are 
multiples (x1, x2 and x3 or even x4) of a baseline 
speed. Accomodating the different percussive 
expressions into these changing speeds requires a 
deep understanding of the basic rhythm. In order

to do so, the artists needs to be able to vary the 
finger speeds – sometimes to extremely high 
speeds, in order to accommodate the popular 
percussive expressions that will resonate 
with the audience. The artists’ imagination 
and creativity will determine the type of 
percussive expressions that are built into each 
rhythmic cycle. Furthermore, the Thavil player 
also needs to have a sound understanding 
of the lyrics of each composition, the flow 
of these compositions and the unwritten 
impromptu improvisations (Kalpana swaras 
or fy;gdh ];tuk; and Raga alapanas or 
Myhgid) that the nathaswaram player 
is likely to come up with on the day. It is 
extremely rare for someone to pocess all these 
attributes as there is no written template that 
are available for them to follow (unlike in a 
western orchestra). The nathaswaram and 
thavil communities in Sri Lanka was littered 
with people who brought all these attributes 
together and were seen as the ultimate 
masters of these skills. In Part 1 of this series 
(Jaffna Monitor 15th December 2024) we 
have already discussed V Thakshinamurthy 
and his reputation. It is however important 
to emphasise, that Thakshinamurthy was a 
product of his environment and there were 
many other equally skilled, but perhaps less 
well known, artists who played along with 
Thakshinamurthy. NR Sinnarasa (from the 
village of Inuvil - ,Ztpy; rpd;duhrh), 
K Ganeshapillai (from Nachimar Kovil or 
ehr;rpkhu; Nfhtpy; fNzrgps;is), M 
Nadarajasundaram Pillai (From Chavakacheri 
or rhtfr;Nrup eluh[Re;juk; gps;is) and 
Kamatchisundaram Pillai (From Jaffna or 
aho;g;ghzk; fhkhl;rpRe;juk;gps;is) are 
four of the pillars of Thavil, whose names 
will live in the memories of all followers of 
carnatic music in Sri Lanka. Together they 
ruled the world of thavil/nathaswaram music 
in the 70s, 80s and 90s and their fame and 
reputation spread all over the Tamil speaking 
world. Even their counterparts in Tamil Nadu 
were frank and open in their praises and 
many decorations and accolades followed all 
these Thavil Vidwans. It has been reported 
that the legendary nathaswaram player 
‘Karaikuruchi Arunasalam’ (fhiuFWr;rp 
mUzhryk;) stated that the nathaswaram 
vidwans in Sri Lanka were extremely lucky 
to have these thavil players backing them at 
their performances. (Personal communication 
with Nathaswaram Vidwan Kondavil 
Panchamurthy). They were commonly referred 
to as ‘Thavil Medai’ (or jtpy; Nkijfs;) - 
meaning the ultimate experts, by their adoring 
fans in Sri Lanka, India and beyond.  
N R Sinnarasa (NRS) of Inuvil. NRS was the 
first cousin of Alavetti V Thakshinamurthy (See 
part 1: Jaffna Monitor 15th December 2024) and 
it is widely known that Thakshinamurthy would 
consult NRS about his rhythmic expressions and 
compositions before he performed them publicly. 
The theoretical counsel from NRS combined with 
his finger speed helped Thakshinamurthy to reach 
new heights. NRS has performed with all leading 
Nathaswaram Vidwans of his time. He was born in 
1934 (24/03/1934) and died in 1991 (06/07/1991). 
His mastery and contributions live through his son 
N R Suthaharan, who continues to live and perform 
in Sri Lanka.

In the hands of these masters, the thavil 
became an instrument that formed the very 
foundations of an art-form that can only 
be described as divine. They caressed their 
instruments with their fingers of one hand 
and a short drum-stick in the other and the 
combination brought out rhythmic expressions 
that anchored, enhanced and synchronised 
with the melodies and improvisations of 
the nathaswaram players. Their appearance, 
outfits and general conduct became part of the 
temple traditions that defined an important 
component of the Sri lankan culture. 
Arasakesari Vidwan Alavetti M P 
Balakrishnan (MPB): MPB or Allavetti 
Balakrishnan (msntl;b ghyfpU~;zd;)- 
as he is populary known, was born in 
Karavetti – a vilage close to Point Pedro in 
1938 (01/11/1938). His father;s name was 
Muthuswamy Periyaswamy and his mother’s 
name was Parvathy. MPB’s father was a 
renowned vocalist and a nathaswaram player 
who was firmly anchored within the carnatic 
music traditions. The family moved to Alavetti 
– known for its musical heritage, when MPB 
was very young and as such MPB came to be 
known as Alavetti Balakrishnan for the rest 
of his career. This gave MPB a very early start 
in his musical career – both in vocal music as 
well as in nathaswaram. His informal lessons 
with his father commenced at the tender age 
of 7 years and continued in a more formal 
manner at the age of 10. The early emphasis 
on vocal music laid the foundations for the 
style of playing which subsequently came 
to characterise MPB – the strong focus on 
the lyrics and the melodic flow (referred to 
as rhfpj;ak; in Tamil). In effect MPB ‘sang’ 
through his nathaswaram.
Having had his early informal lessons from 
his father Mr Periyaswamy, he had his 
further advanced lessons with Thiruchendur 
Krishnamurthy (jpUr;nre;J}u; fpU~;z 
%u;j;jp) in Tamil Nadu in South India. He

made regular (almost 6 monthly) trips to 
South India where he learnt advanced/
latest techniques and compositions in 
vocal/instrumental carnatic music. On his 
return from these visits  he would - along 
with his colleague and mentor Alavetti N 
K Pathmanathan, translate these newly 
acquired knowledge, skills and compositions 
to enhance their joint nathaswaram/thavil 
concerts. Since the age of 17, MPB performed 
at Radio ceylon as a grade 1 artist in his own 
right. NKP and MPB performed as a pair for 
almost a decade and it is known that NKP 
considered this period as the peak of his 
career. Balakrishnan’s influence on NKP was 
profound – both in terms of his emphasis 
on clarity of ‘sahithyam’ (rhfpj;ak;) and the 
technical innovations he brought to their joint 
performances. In the 90s, as  a result of the 
ongoing civil war MPB relocated to Colombo 
where he created a niche position for himself 
within the local temples and at social/cultural 
functions in Colombo. Jintupitti Murugan 
temple and Ponambalawaneshwarar temple 
(nghd;dk;gythNz];tuu;) in Pettah are 
some of the temples where MPB performed 
regularly. 
Allavetti Balakrishnan was the pioneer in 
formalising the Guru-Kulam traditions 
within the local ‘Isai Vellalar’ community 
and as a result, many of the frontline 
nathaswaram artists in Sri lanka were trained 
under MPB’s mentorship. Panchabikesan’s 
son Dr MP Nagendran (Canada) and P S 
Balamurugan (Jaffna) are some of his very 
famous disciples who went on to develop 
the art of nathaswaram to new heights in Sri 
Lanka. Through his initiatives a nathaswaram 
training school was set up in Karavetti, which

potentially widens the access to students 
from the non-Isai vellalar communities. 
MPB received invitations from many parts 
of the world – including Canada, USA, UK 
and in many European countries. Wherever 
the Tamil diaspora settled, MPB visited 
and performed with honours and suitable 
financial rewards following in abundance. 
Two of his sons – M P Segar and Late M P 
Suthahar, also became outstanding artists of 
great independent reputation. Recognising 
his contributions the Title ‘Arasa Kesari’ (king 
of kings) was conferered by the Governor of 
the Northern province in 2023. He also had 
received major national awards previously 
from the government of Sri Lanka and some 
of the spiritual giants of our times such as 
Thirumuruga Kirubanandavariyar (jpUKUf 
fpUghde;j thupahu;).
               
MPB emigrated to canada permanently in 
2016, where he currently lives with the rest 
of his family. His wife’s name is Pankasaleela 
(Date of birth 10/11/1944). The couple have 2 
sons (M P Sekar and Late M P Suthahar) who 
are outstanding nathaswaram players and four 
daughters (Kanagangi, Chitrangi, Sarasangi 
and Rathnangi), most of whom currently 
live in Canada. Chitrangi – a graduate in 
Tamil language and classical music from the 
University of Jaffna, is a strong proponent of 
carnatic music amongst the Tamil diaspora 
community in Canada. She currently runs a 
school for carnatic music – ‘Padini Isaiyagam’ 
(ghbdp ,irafk;) in Canada, thus 
continuing the family traditions.

Ganamurthy-Panchamurthy brothers deserve 
a special mention in our list of eminent 
Vidwans of our time. Their relative youth and 
the spectacle they brought to the music scene 
in Jaffna - when coupled with the supreme 
authority that they displayed at their concerts, 
was greatly admired by an entire generation 
of fans. Their father Mr Kothandapani, 
himself was a widely respected nathaswaram 
player who was instrumental in teaching the 
brothers the art of playing the nathaswaram 
quite early in their lives. The older brother V 
K Ganamurthy was born in 1944 in the village 
of Moolai in Jaffna district. The younger 
brother V K Panchamurthy was born in 1948 
in Vannarpannai. Moolai Arumugam pillai 
(MWKfk; gps;is), Mavittapuram Raja 
(khtpl;lGuk; uh[h) and Inuvil Kandaswamy 
(,Ztpy; fe;jrhkp) are some of the teachers 
who provided the brothers with formal 
nathaswaram lessons. Following their initial 
training in Sri Lanka, the brothers moved 
to India for further training where the likes 
of A V Selvaratnam Pillai (nry;tuj;jpdk; 
gps;is and Koolikarai Pichaiappah Pillai 
(gpr;irag;gh gps;is) willingly accepted 
the brothers as their disciples. They moved to 
Kondavil in 1958 and since then acquired the 
name ‘Kondavil Ganamurthy-Panchamurthy 
brothers’ which would last their entire life 
times.  The brothers held their ‘Arangetram’ 
(the first formal public recital) in 1963 and 
following this formal introduction to the 
music world, the duo became recognised 
as frontline musicians in Jaffna for the next 
4 decades. They received many invitations 
from all over the world including Europe, 
Australia, USA and Canada where their 
energy and the deep interpretations they gave 
while expressing classical ragas and ‘kalpana 
swaras’ kept their audience spellbound. In 
addition to playing as a duo, both of them 
also accompanied almost all the frontline 
nathaswaram vidwans of their times. The 
brothers performed on a regular basis at 
the Ariyalai Sittivinayagar temple for close 
to 20 years and were named as the ‘Asthana 
Vidwans’ of this temple. The concerts played 
with N K Pathmanathan and others at some 
of the most prestigious venues in the world 
are higly valued amongst the rasikas. They 
blended calssical carnatic music with some 
of the popular cinema songs that were based 
on the carnatic or hindustani traditions and 
these concerts were highly sought after by 
their fans across multiple generations. The civil 
war in the 90s forced the family to relocate 
to Colombo and during this period, Mr V K 
Panchamurthy performed at the Trincomalee 
Batrakali Amman temple for 19 consecutive 
years and was given the title of ‘Asthana 
Vidwan’ by this temple too. The relative young 
age at which they touched the pinnacles 
of their respective careers enabled them to 
interact professionally with nathaswaram and 
thavil vidwans spanning five generations. 25

years of service to nathaswaram 
music by the brothers was 
celebrated at  a jubillee celebratory 
event held at the Jaffna University 
in 1989 by the university staff and 
their wider audience from across 
the world.
Following the early death of the 
older brother Mr V K Ganamurthy 
in 2008 due to chronic liver 
disease, Mr V K Panchamurthy 
has continued to perform – both 
solo as well as in partnership with 
other frontline nathaswaram and 
thavil Vidwans. He currently serves 
as the ‘elder’ of the community 
providing mentorship and 
guidance to the next generation of 
nathaswaram players from Jaffna.

of the outstanding nathaswaram vidwans in 
the world and Mr Panchamurthy’s guidance 
is considered pivotal in Kumaran’s rise to 
fame and his attempts to adapt the world 
of nathaswaram/thavil music to meet the 
changing tastes of the rasikas all over the 
world. Kumaran’s son Sasvihan is also an 
accomplished player who has also commenced 
his career at the tender age of 10, and will 
no doubt carry the name and traditions of 
Ganamurthy-Panchamurthy brothers into the 
future.    
Cultural confluence and joint heritage: 
The study of the musical history of any given 
community, provides interesting insights into 
the various interactions that produce what 
we subsequently identify as that community’s 
culture. Indigineous practices and equipment 
are usually shaped and modified by a 
wide variety of extraneous factors and 
the ingenuity of the local artists and the 
demands posed by the local population 
will usually determine what is adopted and 
what is rejected. In this context the study 
of the history of nathaswaram provides an 
interesting mixure of how an instrument 
which was native to nomadic populations 
within the Indian subcontinent (Pungi or 
kFb), had been transformed progressively 
over centuries. In this context it is also worth 
observing that human history is similar to a 
river that continuously flows in one direction 
taking in and assimilating the flow of water 
from multiple tributaries. It is therefore 
fundamentally wrong for those of us living 
down stream to try and dissect out which part 
of the river is the ‘original river’ and which 
part is the ‘contaminant’. The cultural purists of 
our time – wherever they are, must be weaned 
away from resorting to such futile pass times 
and be encouraged to see the commonalities 
in human needs and human endevours which 
have resulted in a ‘joint heritage’ that belongs 
to the whole of humanity. The life stories of 
some of the giants of our times who have 
embedded some of these artforms within our 
communities and have shaped our musical 
history cannot be ignored in the process and 
recording their achievements for posterity is 
the duty of all of us with an interest in music. 
The nathaswaram/thavil vidwans who have 
been named in this article (and in Part 1 of 
this series: Jaffna Monitor 15th December 
2024) are true giants in their fields – by any 
standards, and their names and achievements 
should be celebrated and cherished in our 
collective memories.
To be concluded in Part 4 in the next issue...
