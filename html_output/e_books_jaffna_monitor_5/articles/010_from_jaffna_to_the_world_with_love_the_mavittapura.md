t was no ordinary day in Jaffna. Sections of 
the Sri Lankan Tamil community – both 
in Sri Lanka and beyond, brimmed with a 
sense of pride mixed with unadulterated joy 
and anticipation. There was every possibility 
that the Jaffna peninsula was poised, once 
again in its long history, to become the seat 
of learning and reflective wisdom. They were 
aware that the age old wisdom of the ancient 
Tamil poet -Thiruvalluvar (jpUts;Stu; or 
;srej,a¨‍j¾), was to be displayed in their land 
in a format that would resist the decaying 
effects of the forces of nature for hundreds 
of years to come. It was indeed a major land 
mark in the history of post war Jaffna, that a 
group of philanthropists, local academics and 
skilled sculptors had pooled their knowledge, 
time, effort, skills and resources to construct 
a lasting monument and research facility 
for the study of Thirukkural (jpUts;Stu; 
or ;srej,a¨‍j¾) – one of the oldest Tamil 
texts.  The Thirukkural campus, was declared 
open on this sunny day and dedicated to the 
country and the entire humanity seeking the 
timeless wisdom of Thiruvalluvar on virtue 
(mwk; or .=KO¾u), wealth (nghUs; or Okh) 
and pleasure (,d;gk; or i;=g). The auspicious 
date was the 2nd February 2025, the location 
was Mavittapuram, a little inconspicuous 
village approximately 18km away from the 
Jaffna town and the agency that made this 
dream a reality was the Sivapoomi Trust – a 
highly respected local charity and its dynamic 
Chairman Mr Arumugam Thirumurugan. 
Of course Mavittapuram has had its hay days 
with its mythological links to the 8th century

by worshipping at the Mavittapuram 
Kandaswamy temple and then bathing at 
the adjoining Keerimalai springs. The recent 
history of Mavittapuram however is marred by 
war, artillery shells, areal bombardment and 
the consequent displacement of the population 
resulting in the entire neighbourhood 
becoming an abandoned and desolate 
war-zone. The changes in the surrounding 
environment when the war ended and the 
resultant optimism of the population as the 
lands were handed over to their owners was 
most palpable. The news of the opening of the 
Thrikkural ‘campus’ was certainly the icing on 
the cake.  
Built in the shadows of the above-mentioned 
Mavittapuram Kandaswamy temple and in 
close proximity to the Keerimalai springs and 
the ancient Keerimalai Naguleswaram temple, 
this landmark building,  will no doubt draw 
the attention of scholars and laity with an 
interested in ancient literatures of the world. 
Commenting on the event, Mr Thirumurugan, 
expressed his wish that this facility would, 
over time, evolve into a fully- fledged research 
institute dedicated to the critical study of 
Tamil culture.

The facility will display all 1330 ‘Kurals’

stone slabs, along with Sinhala and English 
translations of selected sections. The inclusion 
of Sinhala and English translations renders 
the possibility that this unique ‘campus’ can 
become part of the common heritage of all 
people living in Sri Lanka – owned by all and

been responsible for successfully completing 
many projects in many parts of the country 
aimed at protecting the Tamil and Hindu 
identity in the Island. The Trust has worked 
on the basis that post-war reconstruction 
needs to be multi-faceted and that cultural 
regeneration needs to be an integral 
component of this project.

cherished by all. It is unfortunate that funding 
available was not adequate to provide English 
and Sinhala translations to all 1330 Kurals. 
Nevertheless, what is on display is adequate 
to give a comprehensive feel of the book to 
those visitors wishing to explore this piece 
of Tamil literature further. The Thirukkural 
(jpUts;Stu;), or ‘Kural’, is estimated to have 
been written between 300 BCE and the 5th 
century CE. Whilst it is generally accepted that 
the ‘Kural’ is from the post ‘Sangam period’, 
the exact dating is still widely debated. The 
content of Thirukkural spans a wide range 
of topics including ethics, morality, love, 
governance, and spirituality in the form of 
couplets - each consisting approximately 8-10 
words. 
The author’s religion has also been a subject 
of speculations with all major religions of the 
time - Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism, 
being suggested by different authorities. This 
uncertainty has, at times led to disputes on 
whether, the statues of Thiruvalluvar should 
include symbols - such as ‘Holy Ash’ and the 
Rudraksha mala (chain made of rudraksha 
beads commonly worn by orthodox Hindus 
on special occasions), usually associated with 
Saivaism. It is indeed an irony of our times 
that a personality such as Thiruvalluvar, who 
in his own life transcended ethnicity and 
religion, should evoke such parochial debates 
in our society. The religious background of 
Thirukkural is hard to determine. The verses 
are definitely embedded within a milieu of 
faith and divinity, though the exact nature 
of that divinity remains open to speculation. 
Attributes such as ‘seated on the lotus of 
the heart’ (kyu;kpir Vfpdhd;), ‘free from 
likes and dislikes’ (Ntz;Ljy; Ntz;lhik 
,yhd;), ‘A lord without peer’ (jdf;Ftik 
,y;yhjhd;), ‘An ocean of wisdom’ (mwpthop 
me;jzd;) and a ‘Lord with eight attributes’ 
(vz; Fzj;jhd;) have been used to describe 
this divinity and these descriptions have been 
interpreted in different ways. The text also 
acknowledges the concepts of rebirth, destiny 
and the eternal journey of ‘samsara’ driven 
by abstract karmic forces. These concepts are 
however common to Hinduism, Buddhism 
and Jainism. The Kural also recommends 
the path of devotion and abject surrender to 
the supreme (or god) as means of extricating 
oneself from samsara.

(Kural 10)
“Only those persons who hold on to the lord’s 
feet will cross the great ocean of birth and 
deaths; it is impossible for the others to do 
so” (Thirukkural by S N Sri Ramathesikan, 
Gangai Puthaka Nilayam, Chennai 2006 ) is 
an example of this general sentiment. This 
emphasis on devotion as the path towards 
extrication from ‘samsara’, suggests a strong 
leaning towards Hinduism, even though this 
assertion is debatable. Within this general 
framework of spirituality more worldly 
issues such as household life, hospitality, 
humility, love, kind speech, fame, truthfulness, 
vegetarianism, honesty, non-violence, 
detachment, learning, wisdom, governance, 
friendship, nationhood, military strength and 
even sex are presented.

Chennai 2006) are examples of kurals within a 
more secular framework. 
The fact that these facets of life have been 
considered in detail almost 1500 years ago and 
expressed through succinct poetic language 
in order to influence wider society is clearly 
a measure of Thiruvalluvar’s genius. There is 
consensus that Thirukkural is relevant to the 
whole of humanity across all ages. It is for this 
reason that the book has been translated into 
over 50 languages and immortalised through 
the installation of Thiruvalluvar’s statue in 
many countries outside the Tamil speaking 
world.

Thirukkural has been part of the curriculum 
in Sri Lankan Tamil medium schools for a very 
long time. Most public speakers frequently 
invoke sayings from Thirukkural to strengthen 
his/her arguments and such illustrations 
are savoured by the listening audience. As 
such Thiruvalluvar has been held in high 
esteem with several statues commemorating 
the poet in different parts of the country. 
However, creating statues and thereby making 
demi-gods out of such illustrious men (and 
women) from history, may potentially dilute 
their message to humanity. Gods (and demi-
gods) are usually worshiped and subject to 
adoration rather than their teachings being 
subject to rational analysis in order to be 
internalised, so that they may positively 
influence human behaviour. By taking 
their messages away from the intellectual 
domain and placing them within the realms 
of the divine, the opportunity to influence 
ordinary human lives are missed. It is in this 
context that the new ‘Thirukkural Campus’ 
at Mavittapuram - encouraging the study, 
debate and further scrutiny of Thirukkural, 
becomes important. The far-reaching 
vision of Mr Arumugam Thirumurugan, in 
encouraging this critical approach needs to 
be seen as a positive example in post-war 
nation building. In addition to the granite 
engravings the Sivapoomi Trust volunteers 
have also sourced multiple translations and 
commentaries of Thirukkural and have made 
them publicly available to all those who seek 
wisdom. Hon. Mr R Mahadevan, Judge of the 
Supreme Court of India, participated as the 
chief guest at the opening day celebrations 
on the 2nd February 2025. In his speech he 
demonstrated his outstanding scholarship in 
Tamil and Sangam literature and emphasised 
the relevance of Thirukkural to contemporary 
society.  The power of Mr Mahadevan’s prose 
and his wide knowledge and ability to relate 
the lessons of Thirukkural to other Tamil 
classics such as ‘Kamba Ramayanam’ (or 
The statues of Thiruvalluvar at the University 
of London (A), United Kingdom and in the 
French town of Cergy (B)

Mr K Vaidyanathan was

the Christians, or Varnasi (or Kashi) is a place of devotion and

entire Tamil speaking world. He went on to observe that the 
history of Jaffna – both ancient and contemporary, resonates 
strongly within the Tamil psyche and hence the construction 
of the Thirukkural campus in Jaffna was most appropriate and 
was a recognition of these sentiments. These observations, 
no doubt evoked very strong feelings in the minds of all 
participants.  The event was also marked by music, debates 
and poetry with several other artists and academics from

South India and Sri Lanka taking part. The 
campus building also has limited residential 
facilities for visiting scholars – internal and 
external, and the pull factor of the entire 
complex is bound to become a major tourist 
attraction in Northern Sri Lanka.
The project has been undertaken through 
philanthropic funding and completed within 
a relatively short time period – given the 
complexities inherent in transcribing a large 
volume of text into manual granite carvings. 
It is also most appropriate that this facility is 
being dedicated to the people of Sri Lanka 
in 2025, which marks the 25th anniversary 
of the Sivapoomi Trust. In dedicating this 
facility to the country, Mr Thirumurugan 
expressed his hope that the community will 
cherish this facility and the underpinning 
sentiments of all those responsible for its 
successful construction for centuries to come. 
Thiruvalluvar’s messages – like that of the 
Buddha, Jesus or Ghandi belong to the whole 
of humanity. He clearly transcended narrow 
boundaries and challenges us also to do 
so……….will we listen?
