6,"A few years before, In a twist of fate, an honest and upright government servant who had devoted his entire career to serving the nation, even holding a crucial role during wartime as Kilinochchi's Government Agent (GA), was forced into early retirement. His only fault? Standing firm against the unethical appointments and transfers orchestrated by an immoral Jaffna Tamil politician. When he refused to comply, the politician used his influence to transfer him to a powerless post in a ministry, effectively sidelining his exemplary service. Deeply hurt by the injustice and corruption, this dedicated civil servant chose to retire three months earlier than planned, leaving the matter, in his words, ""to God.""",18,23,2
