uring the last presidential election, the 
Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), 
once the dominant force in Tamil politics, 
found itself caught in a comical downward 
spiral of confusion and contradiction. Factions 
within the party were fiercely divided over 
which presidential candidate to support, 
turning what should have been a strategic 
decision into a farcical debacle. Bewildered 
by the lack of direction, long-time supporters 
watched in disbelief as their once-proud 
political organization descended into chaos.
At the heart of this circus was ITAK leader 
Mavai Senathiraja, whose political juggling act 
felt straight out of a Vadivelu comedy sketch. 
If you recall the famous line, "For the money 
I got from him, I voted for the ladder; for the 
money I got from you, I voted for the coconut 
tree," you'd think Mavai had taken it to heart. 
He practically endorsed all three major 
candidates simultaneously, leaving everyone 
scratching their heads. In an era where 
clarity is king, ITAK was serving confusion 
by the bucketload. Party members were left 
wondering: "Who exactly are we supposed to 
support again?"
