From the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK), I believe you are 
one of the few parliamentarians 
who openly criticize the misdeeds 
of the LTTE while still continuing 
to do so. How did you find the 
courage to speak up?
There's no special courage in speaking 
the truth. It's my commitment to it that 
drives me. I've always believed that 
truth has its own power. When Galileo 
said the Earth revolved around the sun, 
they tried to silence him, but did that 
change the truth? The same applies here. 
The truth doesn't change because it's 
uncomfortable or unpopular at the time.

Let me be clear: I don't criticize the LTTE as a 
whole, but I do address their specific wrongs. 
This isn't like the famous Vadivelu joke — 'If it 
happens to you, it's blood; if it happens to me, 
it's just tomato chutney.' A section of LTTE 
supporters think that way. When the Tigers 
stormed a mosque in Kattankudy and killed 
innocent people while they prayed, can we 
claim it wasn't real blood spilled, just tomato 
chutney? No. Wrong is wrong. Pointing out 
those wrongs isn't an attack on them; it's an 
acknowledgement of facts.
If we want the world to stand with us, we must 
also have the courage to stand by the truth. 
We, Tamils, often expect the international 
community to raise their voice for us, but 
how can we expect that if we refuse to 
face our own mistakes? We accuse the Sri 
Lankan government of war crimes based on 
international reports, and those very reports 
say that both sides were guilty of violations. 
Yet, some only want to cherry-pick the parts 
that suit their narrative, ignoring the rest. It 
doesn't work like that.
At the same time, I've always said we must 
honour the sacrifices of the LTTE fighters, 
those who gave their lives for our people. 
But that honour should come from a place of 
justice, not from covering up mistakes.
In the last election, even my own party 
members campaigned against me, accusing me 
of being "anti-Tamil nationalism." I spoke at 
over 500 meetings during the campaign, and 
at every single one, people asked, "Are you 
against the liberation struggle?" I gave them 
the same answer every time: "I do not believe 
in armed conflict. If you want someone who 
supports violence, don't vote for me."
And yet, I won. Many so-called "staunch Tamil 
nationalists" lost. Why? Because the people are 
smarter than we give them credit for. They're 
tired of the old narratives. They want leaders 
who stand for the truth, not for myths and 
glorified half-truths. I'm not afraid of losing 
while standing for the truth. The people see it, 
and that's what matters.
By criticizing the LTTE, aren't you 
worried about being labelled a traitor?
No, I'm not worried because I'm not a traitor. 
I've addressed this in party meetings as well—
those who call me a traitor do so out of fear. 
And frankly, their fear is justified. Many of 
them were the ones who acted as informants, 
pointing out people to the authorities at every 
opportunity. I never engaged in such activities, 
so I have no reason to be afraid of their labels.
When the LTTE was targeting EPRLF 
members, I was one of the people who 
stepped up to shelter those who managed to 
escape. I personally ensured they were safely 
transported to Colombo, where they found 
refuge at Colombo Hindu College. So, if 
standing by what's right makes me a traitor in 
their eyes, then so be it. I know my conscience 
is clear.
The LTTE had a powerful military 
presence, so why do you think they 
eventually fell? What do you believe 
were the reasons behind their 
downfall? Were there internal factors 
at play?
The late Mr Sampanthan often noted, even in 
Parliament, that the LTTE didn't allow space 
for human rights or democracy—a point some 
criticized but held true. As a militant group, 
they couldn't create room for democratic 
processes; had they done so, they wouldn't 
have functioned as such.

It's important to remember that the suffering 
of our people pushed the Tigers into rebellion. 
Their rise wasn't without cause. However, 
where the LTTE went wrong was in inflicting 
the same suffering on other communities. It 
wasn't enough for them to declare themselves 
against the Sinhalese; they needed to 
back this up with their actions. Targeting 
innocent Sinhalese civilians with bombings 
only alienated them further. And similarly, 
the LTTE's actions against the Muslim 
community—killing Muslims or expelling 
them from the North in a single day and 
seizing their properties—were grave mistakes.
As a community that had endured immense 
pain and suffering, we shouldn't have allowed 
the same suffering to be inflicted on others. 
If the LTTE had avoided these atrocities, 
there's a chance that the Sinhalese community 
might have viewed them as a committed and 
principled military force. Had they been more 
careful not to harm innocent civilians and 
made it clear that their struggle was purely 
for justice and rights, it could have fostered 
a different perception among the Sinhalese. 
In some alternate reality, things might have 
turned out differently if these mistakes hadn't 
been made.
What is your opinion on the forced 
recruitment conducted by the LTTE 
during the final stages of the war?
This is well-documented in UN reports. If 
we're calling for an international investigation 
into the final stages of the war, then the actions 
of the LTTE must also be scrutinized. It would 
be unreasonable to demand an investigation 
into the Sri Lankan government's actions 
while exempting the LTTE. That stance simply 
doesn't hold up.
The whole purpose of an international 
investigation is to ensure impartiality. If we 
truly seek justice, we can't expect investigators 
to turn a blind eye to our own misdeeds while 
focusing solely on the other side's faults. That 
doesn't make any sense.
For example, we accuse the Sri Lankan 
government of directing civilians into so-
called "no-fire zones" and then shelling those 
areas. There's evidence to support this, and 
it occurred on three separate occasions. We 
argue that these actions must be investigated 
and those responsible held accountable. But to 
then claim that the LTTE's crimes, like forced 
recruitment, should not be investigated would 
be absurd. If we're demanding justice, it must 
be justice for all.
The LTTE's act of forced recruitment 
was wrong, wasn't it?
If it happened as documented in the UN 
reports, then yes, it was undoubtedly a serious 
wrongdoing.
In that case, why did you represent 
Kannadasan—a prominent LTTE 
member and a war criminal accused 
of forcibly recruiting more than 500 
innocent children, dragging them into 
war? Hundreds of innocent children, 
some as young as 10, died because of 
him. A former UN employee even gave 
us an extensive interview detailing 
his war crimes. I assume you've read 
it? How could you stand in defence of 
such a man in court?
That case was tied to a specific incident of

forced recruitment. But as 
a lawyer, my duty is not to 
decide who deserves a defence 
and who doesn't. The law 
only works if every person, 
no matter how severe their 
alleged crimes, has the right to 
representation. If lawyers start 
refusing cases based on who 
the person is or what they're 
accused of, the entire system 
breaks down. My role was to 
ensure the system functions 
as it should and to let justice 
prevail by giving everyone their 
day in court. Without that, we 
lose the very foundation of 
justice.
But was it really necessary for 
Kannadasan

you—an influential lawyer—to represent him 
directly? Defending someone like Kannadasan, 
accused of abducting over 500 innocent 
children for war, is no different from those 
so-called Tamil nationalist lawyers who defend 
drug dealers. How could you choose to protect 
someone like that?
In the case against Kannadasan, there was 
no evidence to prove that he was physically 
present where the alleged crime occurred. As 
a lawyer, my role is not to pass judgment but 
to ensure that the legal process is followed and 
that the rights of the accused are respected.
Some people accuse you of not taking 
up enough cases related to the rights 
of the Tamil people. What is your 
response to that?
Who represented the landmark case on land 
rights? Who led the legal battle and won when 
Sampur was leased to a foreign company for 
250 years? It was me. Has anyone else taken 
real, meaningful action to ensure the release of 
Tamil lands?
One of the most critical cases I handled was 
defending our party's advocacy for federalism, 
which was challenged as a violation of the 6th 
Amendment. I successfully argued the case, 
and the court upheld our right to stand for 
federalism.
In 2007-08, when the pass system was unfairly 
imposed in Vavuniya, I took it to court and 
won. That victory was a landmark. Similarly, 
in 2007, when Gotabaya Rajapaksa forcibly 
evicted people staying in lodges in Colombo 
overnight, I fought the case in court and won.
So, to those who claim I haven't taken up 
enough Tamil rights cases, I ask—who else has 
fought and won these significant battles for our 
people?
What are the significant cases you're 
working on currently?
At present, I'm handling the case concerning 
Kurunthur Malai. I also recently won the case 
related to Vedukkunari Malai. In addition, I 
am managing 2,176 cases pertaining to the 
High-Security Zone in Palaly.
Many people focus on the cases I've won, but 
in reality, I've lost more cases than I've won. 
My former senior even nicknamed me the 
lawyer for lost causes.
The issues faced by Eastern Tamils 
are said to be different from those 
of Northern Tamils, particularly 
around land disputes with the Muslim 
community. Do you have a specific 
agenda to address the distinct needs 
of Eastern Tamils?
I fully agree. The challenges in the East are 
quite different, largely due to the unique ethnic 
composition of the region. Over the years, 
our population in the East has decreased, 
which has only added to the complexity of 
the situation. That's why we've had to take a 
different approach there, particularly regarding 
land disputes. These issues are far more 
pressing in the East compared to the North, 
and we're very conscious of that. We've tailored 
our strategies to address the distinct needs of 
Eastern Tamils, ensuring that their concerns 
are met in a way that truly reflects their reality.
There are claims that, like ITAK 
MP Shanakiyan Rasamanickam 
and others, you're more focused on 
addressing the concerns of the Eastern
