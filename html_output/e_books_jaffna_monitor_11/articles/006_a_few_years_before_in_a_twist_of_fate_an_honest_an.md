A 
few years before, In a twist of fate, an 
honest and upright government servant 
who had devoted his entire career to serving 
the nation, even holding a crucial role during 
wartime as Kilinochchi's Government Agent 
(GA), was forced into early retirement. His 
only fault? Standing firm against the unethical 
appointments and transfers orchestrated by 
an immoral Jaffna Tamil politician. When 
he refused to comply, the politician used his 
influence to transfer him to a powerless post in 
a ministry, effectively sidelining his exemplary 
service. Deeply hurt by the injustice and 
corruption, this dedicated civil servant chose 
to retire three months earlier than planned, 
leaving the matter, in his words, "to God."
But life took a surprising turn. Recognizing 
his integrity and dedication, the newly 
elected President of Sri Lanka, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake, and his National People's Power 
(NPP) party reached out to him. They offered 
him a role even more influential than his 
previous post: the Governor of the Northern 
Province. That civil servant is none other than 
Nagalingam Vethanayagam, a decorated figure 
in the Sri Lankan Administrative Service, now 
entrusted with greater responsibility as the 
Northern Province Governor.
Here are the highlights from our exclusive 
interview with Nagalingam Vethanayagam, the 
newly appointed Governor of the Northern 
Province:
Did you anticipate being appointed 
as a Governor, and how did your 
association with the NPP government 
come about?
I neither anticipated the appointment nor 
sought it. I had no communication with 
anyone, nor was I pursuing such a role. The 
National People's Power )(NPP) approached 
me with their offer, stating they had an 
important position in mind. At first, I assumed 
it was a political appointment, and I made it 
unequivocally clear that I had no intention of 
engaging in politics. They then clarified that 
it was a governorship, free from any political 
affiliation. I agreed to consider the offer, and 
after a day of deliberation, I accepted the 
position on the condition that there would 
be no political interference in my duties as 
Governor. To my surprise, they wholeheartedly 
agreed and even emphasized that they were 
specifically seeking a Governor without 
political allegiance. They assured me that I 
would have complete autonomy to function 
without any political ties.
I am convinced that, under any other 
President, I would not have been selected 
for this position. Even if the appointment 
had been offered, it would have been 
exceedingly difficult to carry out my duties 
effectively. In fact, had the offer come from 
another administration, I would likely have 
declined. For me, serving the public with full 
independence is non-negotiable. Any form 
of interference dictating my actions would 
have rendered meaningful service impossible. 
This may have been the reality under previous 
governments, but with President Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake, the environment is 
entirely different.
Did the NPP government provide 
assurance that there would be no 
political intervention during your 
tenure as the Governor of the Northern 
Province?

Yes, they assured me of that. They specifically 
promised that I could work without any fear 
and follow my conscience. They clearly stated 
they would not interfere in my governorship, 
not even by one per cent.
Several NPP leaders have indicated 
to Jaffna Monitor that your selection 
as Governor was largely due to your 
impeccable reputation and the trust 
you've earned as a dedicated civil 
servant. Did they provide any reasons 
for choosing you for this role?
They conveyed that my integrity holds 
significant esteem, both publicly and 
within their internal ranks. They expressed 
unwavering confidence in my ethical standing, 
underscoring that my involvement would be 
instrumental in establishing a transparent 
and accountable administration in the 
Northern Province. It is on this foundation, 
I believe, that they approached me regarding 
the governorship. I understand that they 
conducted extensive consultations with key 
figures across the Northern Province to gather 
feedback before formally extending the offer to 
me.
You were compelled to leave your 
position as Government Agent just 
three months before your retirement 
due to the actions of a Jaffna 
politician. Now, you've returned to 
Jaffna, not just as a civil servant but 
as the Governor of the entire Northern 
Province. Can you tell us what exactly 
transpired?
Political interference was somewhat restrained 
during the "Good Governance" era under 
Maithripala Sirisena. However, even then, a 
certain State Minister from Jaffna managed 
to exert his influence. He issued directives—
ordering appointments and transfers—
and demanded that I comply. One of his 
instructions was to select beneficiaries from 
a list he personally provided. I faced a choice: 
Should I choose those who genuinely needed 
assistance or follow the politician's instructions 
and pick his favoured individuals? I stood firm 
and refused to comply.
After the ''Good Governance'' period ended 
and Gotabaya Rajapaksa assumed the 
presidency, I had just three months before 
retirement. Unfortunately, the same politician 
had now been appointed Chairman of the 
Jaffna District Coordinating Committee and 
once again tried to impose his will through 
similar directives. I did not yield then, either.
With only a few months left in my career, he 
used his influence to have me transferred to a 
meaningless "dummy" position at the Ministry 
of Public Administration in Colombo. Under 
normal circumstances, no one nearing 
retirement with less than a year of service can 
be transferred—yet they went ahead and did 
it, causing me significant distress. I was left 
deeply disheartened and disillusioned. On the 
day I received the transfer order, I decided to 
retire with a heavy heart.
Was the minister you mentioned 
Douglas Devananda?
No, he wasn't a minister during Maithripala 
Sirisena's tenure. In fact, he only became a 
cabinet minister under Gotabaya Rajapaksa's 
presidency. However, he never interfered with 
my duties or made any unreasonable demands. 
He always treated me with respect and dignity.
As for the politician who tried to meddle

unethically in my work, I prefer not to name 
him directly, but I'm sure you can infer who it 
is. I'll leave that to your discretion.
During Sirisena's period, I somehow managed 
to withstand the pressures from that politician. 
However, once Gotabaya came into power, 
the situation escalated dramatically. His 
influence became intolerable, and it was clear 
he harboured resentment toward me for 
standing firm against his demands during the 
previous government. Once a more favourable 
administration came into power, he unleashed 
his full weight against me. At that point, 
he wasn't a minister, but he served as the 
Chairman of the Jaffna District Coordinating 
Committee, and he used that position to make 
my work increasingly difficult.
You retired prematurely with a heavy 
heart, and now you've returned to 
the same place but in an even higher 
position. How do you view this?
I am a deeply religious person, and I interpret 
this turn of events as an act of divine 
intervention. When I was forced into early 
retirement, I was disheartened, feeling the 
weight of injustice, but I placed my burdens in 
God's hands. During that time, I often asked, 
"How can certain politicians behave this way, 
disregarding fairness and ethics?" It wasn't 
just personal frustration, but concern for the 
direction of the country. I questioned, "What 
does this mean for the future? Is there no end 
to this?" These were the thoughts I wrestled 
with in search of comfort and understanding.
While I prayed for justice and a resolution to 
the unfairness I faced, I never once asked for 
a position of power or authority. The idea of 
being appointed Governor never crossed my 
mind. It's not something I sought or expected. 
This role, in many ways, feels like something

beyond my own efforts—it feels like fate, or 
perhaps divine will, that brought me back in a 
position where I can now serve the people and 
the region in a meaningful way.
You came from a very humble 
background and have now reached 
the highest position in the Northern 
Province. Can you tell me about your 
upbringing and how it shaped who you 
are today?
My father, Nagalingam, was a well-respected 
teacher and social activist. He was also a Tamil 
Pandithar (scholar) who was deeply committed 
to social service. Whenever there was a 
land dispute or any community issue in our 
village, people would come to my father for 
guidance. They would fully accept his advice, 
and I witnessed this many times. I remember 
hearing villagers say, "If the Pandithar has 
spoken, it must be right." The trust the villagers 
had in him remained unwavering until his 
passing.
My father often said, "What greater happiness 
is there than serving people?" That was his 
guiding philosophy. Another principle he 
instilled in us was to live with integrity. He 
taught us never to desire another's belongings 
in any way. He often reminded us, "If you live 
honestly and walk the right path, and still face 
challenges, leave them in God's hands." These 
teachings have deeply influenced me and 
shaped the values I hold today.
What is God for you?
For me, God is closely tied to the concept 
of karma. I believe that everything we do in 
life—good or bad—has consequences, and 
that the universe, in its own time, balances 
these actions. God, in my view, the force 
that governs this cycle of cause and effect. 
It's through karma that justice and fairness 
ultimately prevail.
In Jaffna Monitor, a former UN worker 
gave an exclusive testimony where 
he praised you as one of the finest 
Government Agents (GA) during the 
war, highlighting how you worked 
relentlessly, risking your life in the war 
zone. Could you elaborate on this?
That period was one of the most challenging 
times in my career. I was serving as the 
Government Agent (GA) of Kilinochchi 
District, right in the heart of the conflict zone. 
The war was at its peak, and the situation on 
the ground was dire. Roads were constantly 
under threat from landmines and artillery 
fire, with explosions happening regularly. 
Every time we had to travel, there was a 
real risk to our lives. We often traveled with 
white flags attached to our vehicles, signaling 
our neutrality as civil servants. Even then, 
the dangers were immense, and we had no 
guarantees of safety.
The work itself was relentless. The people 
were suffering, and it was our responsibility to 
ensure they had access to essential services—
food, medical aid, and shelter. Every decision 
had life-or-death implications. Despite 
the ongoing conflict, we tried to maintain 
impartiality, and I'm thankful that both the 
military and the LTTE respected our efforts. 
They did not interfere with our duties, which 
allowed us to focus on serving the civilians 
caught in the crossfire.
According to our constitution, the 
role of Governor is meant to be non-
political. However, there has been

Jaffna Monitor

a troubling precedent where many 
Governors have been involved in 
politics, with some even attending 
political rallies in support of the ruling 
government and its politicians. How do 
you plan to operate in this position?
I will strictly adhere to the non-political 
nature of the Governor's role. I have no 
intention of aligning myself with any political 
party or engaging in political activities. I am 
confident that this government will not ask 
me to compromise my position or involve me 
in political matters. My focus will be entirely 
on fulfilling my responsibilities impartially, 
without endorsing any political party or 
politician. My role is to serve the people, 
and I intend to do that without any political 
affiliations or influence.
How do you think this government is 
performing?
I believe the government is heading in the 
right direction. President Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake is delivering on the promises 
he made. Many people who spoke to me 
mentioned that if it had been any other 
President, someone like me—who is known 
for maintaining strict neutrality—would not 
have been chosen for this position. There is a 
strong sense of confidence that this President 
will honor the promises. In the past, many 
Presidents made numerous promises but failed 
to deliver. I, along with the public, trust that 
this government will not only make promises 
but also ensure they are fulfilled.
Regarding Tamil rights and power-
sharing, what do you believe the 
President will do?
People believe he will follow through on what 
he has promised.
What are your plans for the Northern 
Province as Governor?
Public service should inspire trust and win the 
hearts of the people, which is also the vision of 
the President. Unfortunately, some government 
officials have not fulfilled their duties properly, 
leading to widespread disillusionment and 
frustration among the public. Many have 
suffered injustices as a result. My priority is to 
rebuild the people's faith in public institutions, 
ensuring that services are delivered fairly and 
efficiently. At the same time, I will focus on 
driving development projects that can run 
concurrently, ensuring that progress and good 
governance go hand in hand in the Northern 
Province.
What would you identify as your 
immediate priority upon assuming this 
role?
The immediate priority is structural 
change. That is crucial. We need to focus on 
implementing programs that will uplift the 
livelihoods of the grassroots population.
Can a Governor alone bring about 
structural change?
No, it cannot be done alone. But with the 
government's support and the collaboration 
of all stakeholders, we can bring about 
meaningful change. It requires a collective 
effort.
It seems like there's a noticeable 
change at the Governor's residence. 
Can you tell us about it?

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
23
Yes, there has been a change. The doors of the 
Governor's residence are open to everyone. 
Anyone wishing to meet me is welcome, as this 
space belongs to everyone. Even when I served 
as the Government Agent, people would come 
to see me as late as 8 PM, and I never turned 
anyone away. I believe in being accessible to 
the public, and that will continue here.
I am not one for luxury. My swearing-in 
ceremony was a simple event, without any 
extravagance, and I have instructed that future 
events I attend should remain simple and 
modest.
Every Monday, I will be available at the 
Governor's office for anyone who wishes 
to meet me. I also plan to travel across the 
districts to meet people directly. It's not 
just about listening to their concerns; I am 
committed to taking concrete steps to resolve 
their issues. Without delivering results, the 
people will not regain trust.
Times have changed. If the same 
politician who once caused you 
difficulties were to approach you for 
help, how would you respond?
I have never believed in holding grudges or 
seeking revenge—it's simply not a part of my 
principles. If that politician were to approach 
me with a request that genuinely benefits the 
people, and if it is a just cause, I would assist 
without hesitation. My primary focus is always 
the well-being of the people, not personal 
grievances.
