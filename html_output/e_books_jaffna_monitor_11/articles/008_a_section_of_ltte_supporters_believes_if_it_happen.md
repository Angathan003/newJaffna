Muslim community, potentially at the 
expense of the welfare of the Eastern 
Tamils. How do you respond to these 
accusations?
The situation with the Muslim community in 
the East largely stems from a simple reality—
limited land availability. One of the main 
reasons behind this issue is their significant 
population growth, which is notably higher 
than that of the Tamil community. This growth 
can be attributed to two main factors.
Firstly, there is a natural increase in 
population, as the Muslim community tends 
to marry early. While the Tamil population 
might go through one generation, Muslims 
often progress through two in the same period. 
Tamil families may have one or two children, 
whereas Muslim families might have five, six, 
or even more. Naturally, this leads to a much 
faster population growth among Muslims.
Secondly, many Tamils have permanently 
emigrated, while Muslims, even if they go 
abroad for work, tend to return after earning 
money, further adding to their numbers in 
the region. We cannot blame the Muslim 
community for their population growth—it's 
neither a crime nor something we can control.
As their population grows, the land they 
currently occupy becomes insufficient, 
particularly in places like Ampara, where 
the Muslim community has the least amount 
of land available. This forces them to seek 
new land, and they often move into areas 
traditionally occupied by Tamils. Initially, 
they come as traders and, over time, buy land. 
This has led to the perception that Muslims 
are encroaching on Tamil lands and thriving 
more than the Tamils, but the truth is, it's 
simply a natural demographic shift. In such 
circumstances, what can we do?
Is it true that Muslims are encroaching 
on Tamil lands, and do you agree with 
this view?
Yes, it's true that Muslims are purchasing 
land in Tamil areas and expanding—that's a 
fact. At one point, Kattankudy was among the 
most densely populated areas in the world per 
square meter. The rapid population growth 
within a limited land space in Kattankudy has 
been the primary driver of this expansion. 
While we cannot blame the Muslim 
community for their natural population 
growth, it has undeniably led to a sense of 
frustration among the Tamil population.
What is your response to those who 
argue that you should support only 
the Tamils when it comes to Tamil and 
Muslim issues?
That's not necessary. The Tamil Arasu Katchi 
represents both communities. According to 
our party's constitution, our core policy is to 
advocate for a united Sri Lanka where both a 
Tamil government and a Muslim government 
are established on a federal basis. We believe in 
building a system that recognizes and respects

the rights of both Tamils and Muslims, 
ensuring fair representation and governance 
for all. Supporting only one community would 
go against the very principles our party stands 
for.
Do Muslims vote for your party?
In the early days, Muslims did vote for us. 
They don't anymore. It was only in 1987 that 
political parties specifically representing 
Muslims emerged. Before that, there were 
no political parties solely for the Muslim 
community.
So, Do you speak for Muslims on a 
moral basis now?
Yes, it is purely on a moral basis. And not 
just for Muslims, we must also speak for the 
Sinhalese as well.
Why didn't you accept ministerial 
positions during the 'Good Governance' 
Government headed by Maithripala 
Sirisena?
Looking back, I now question whether that 
decision was the right one. At the time, I was 
among those who believed we should not 
accept ministerial positions, thinking it was 
best to remain independent of the government. 
However, in hindsight, there were moments 
where accepting those roles might have 
allowed us to secure quicker solutions for our 
people.
Today, our political strength has diminished 
considerably—we're no longer viewed as a 
significant minority. In such circumstances, 
staying solely in opposition may not always be 
the most effective way to achieve progress.
Now, this doesn't mean we should align 
ourselves with forces that oppress us. But it 
does mean that when a government is open to 
cooperation, we must be willing to work with 
them to achieve our goals. 
Take, for example, Thondaman in 1977 when 
he was the  Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF) leader. The party allowed him to join 
the government, and despite being just one 
representative in a government with a 5/6 
majority, he successfully secured citizenship 
rights for upcountry Tamils by working with 
the United National Party (UNP).
We can't say his decision to collaborate with a 
government perceived as oppressive in order to 
help an oppressed community was wrong—it 
was strategic. Sometimes, when we lack direct 
political power, we must find alternative ways 
to achieve our objectives.
When the situation arises for joining 
the government, will you make that 
decision independently, or will it be a 
collective party decision?
It will be a collective decision made by the 
party. When it comes to such significant 
matters, the primary party representing the 
people must decide on behalf of the entire 
community.
Many have misquoted Thanthai Chelva's 
famous statement, "Only God can save the 
Tamils now," taking it out of context. In 
reality, he said this in April 1970 at the Jaffna 
Kachcheri, after the parliamentary election 
results were announced. Before that, in the 
1960 election, Thanthai Chelva had supported 
a major party, and in 1965, he even formed 
an alliance with the UNP to establish a 
government. At that time, the Tamil Arasu
