U
pali Mama, a former Janatha Vimukthi 
Peramuna (JVP) militant whose 
revolutionary dreams were once steeped in 
blood, now lives a peaceful life with his wife 
and three children. His violent past, once 
driven by Marxist-Leninist ideology, has 
long been buried. Yet, the wounds of that era 
remain deeply etched in his soul. His brother 
and two other close relatives were among the 
countless lives claimed by the brutal actions 
of the Sri Lankan security forces, just as many 
intellectuals and innocent people were victims 
of JVP militants during the insurrection. These 
scars linger, both in Upali Mama and in the 
hearts of those affected by the violence from 
both sides—JVP and security forces alike—
leaving pain that no passage of time can fully 
heal.
For Upali Mama, last week seemed like a 
chapter from a fairy tale—pulled straight out 
of a dream, or perhaps, a strange twist of fate. 
He showed this correspondent a Sinhala-
language newspaper. On the front page was a 
picture of Anura Kumara Dissanayake—the 
current leader of the JVP, a man who had once 
walked a similar path of rebellion—standing 
tall, taking the oath of office as the new 
President of Sri Lanka. Behind him, in full 
military regalia, stood the imposing chiefs of 
the tri-forces, all standing respectfully.
Upali Mama looked at the picture. With a quiet 
sigh, he turned to this correspondent and said, 
"Even in my wildest dreams, I never imagined 
this. One of our comrades, once hunted like 
animals, is now the Executive President of Sri 
Lanka, giving orders to the very forces that 
hunted us. And those forces, who killed our 
brothers, are now standing at attention, ready 
to follow his every word."
While Upali Mama could never have 
envisioned this day, it is highly doubtful that 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake—the newly 
sworn-in 9th Executive President of the 
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka—
had envisioned it either, back when he was

an underground JVP activist. In 1992, he 
couldn't even attend his father's funeral, 
as police and troops were waiting at his 
home, ready to arrest him. The idea would 
have seemed even more improbable when 
his Loku Mama (Father's elder brother)—a 
fellow JVP activist with whom Anura shared 
a close political and emotional bond—was 
killed by Sri Lankan security forces.  
Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake was born on November 24, 
1968, in Galewela, located in the Matale 
District of the Central Province. Though it is 
a Sinhala-majority area, a significant number 
of Tamils and Muslims also live there. When 
he was still a child, his family moved to the 
rural village of Thambuthegama, nestled in 
the Anuradhapura District, a region deeply 
rooted in Sinhala heritage. Anura Kumara, 
the son of a humble farmer, was just two and 
a half years old when the JVP, a Marxist-
Leninist revolutionary movement led by the 
fiery Rohana Wijeweera, launched its first 
insurrection in 1971. This bold yet ill-fated 
rebellion against the Sri Lankan government, 
quietly supported by a few communist

nations, including North Korea, would later 
shape the political landscape Anura would 
come to navigate.
By the time the JVP's second violent uprising 
erupted in April 1987, Anura Kumara was 
no longer the quiet village boy. He had 
already achieved a significant milestone 
by then—becoming the first student from 
Thambuthegama Central College to gain 
university entrance. He earned his place at 
the prestigious University of Peradeniya, a 
rare accomplishment for someone from such 
a modest background. It was during this 
time that Anura's political activism ignited. 
Aligned with the JVP's ideology, he quickly 
became a fiercely active student activist, deeply 
embedded in the political turbulence that 
swept the country.
Sources close to him say that Anura's 
involvement with the JVP began early in his 
school days when, like many other teenagers 
and youth, the seeds of rebellion were sown in 
his mind. Officially joining the JVP in 1987—
the same year the JVP launched its violent 
campaign against the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord—
Anura threw himself into full-time political 
activities. It was a dangerous time, one where 
survival often meant going underground to 
evade the brutal crackdowns by government 
forces.
When the security forces tightened their grip, 
Anura was forced to hide in his professor's 
house for months, narrowly escaping arrest 
and potential death. Later, in 1992, after 
the dust of the insurrection had somewhat 
settled, Anura transferred to the University 
of Kelaniya, where he completed his studies, 
graduating in 1995 with a degree in physics.
He was born a bright student," a former 
roommate of Anura Kumara Dissanayake from 
the University of Kelaniya told Jaffna Monitor. 
"We rarely saw him studying, yet somehow, 
he always ended up as one of the top scorers 
in exams." He elaborated further, sharing how 
Anura's late-night habits were something of 
a mystery to his peers. "Anura would often 
jump out of our hostel room late at night and 
wouldn't return until the early hours of the

morning, only to sleep through most of the 
day, skipping lectures altogether. At the time, 
we had no idea what he was up to."
The roommate speculated that Anura was 
likely engaged in covert work during those late 
hours, possibly conducting secret education 
classes for JVP members or campaigning in 
villages about the party's policies. "We hardly 
ever saw him with books," he added, "but 
when exam time came, he would perform 
exceptionally well. It left us wondering if 
he was sneaking off in the night to study 
somewhere. It was as if he had some secret 
method.
Anura Kumara's teachers recall him as an 
academically gifted student, describing him as 
"educationally blessed." However, that blessing 
didn't seem to extend to his early life. Born to 
a minor employee of the Surveyor General's 
Department who also engaged in farming 
and a homemaker mother, Anura's childhood 
was marked by hardship and relentless 
work. Despite his brilliance, he had to juggle 
multiple responsibilities. He tutored younger 
students in mathematics in his village and sold 
cigarettes and biscuits on trains after school 
to help support his family. In an interview, 
he reflected on those challenging times, 
admitting, "Whenever my teachers appeared 
on the train, I would hurriedly hide my goods 
in embarrassment.
Trailblazer 
The post-independence history of Sri Lankan 
politics has largely been confined to a few elite, 
English-speaking families. Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake is only the second president in 
Sri Lanka's history to emerge from outside this 
traditional, English-educated political elite 
that has long held the reins of power. The first 
exception to this elite lineage was Ranasinghe 
Premadasa, the third executive president. In a 
cruel twist of history, Premadasa, once a man 
of the people, played a pivotal role in the brutal 
suppression of the JVP's second insurrection, 
overseeing the deaths of thousands of Sinhala 
youths.
However, some critics argue that while 
Ranasinghe Premadasa did come from 
outside the political aristocracy, he cannot 
truly be considered an outsider. By the time

he became president, he had already served 
as prime minister for 11 years and had, by 
then, experienced the trappings of power 
and privilege. In that sense, they contend, 
Premadasa did not step into the presidency as 
a complete outsider but rather as someone who 
had already tasted power.
By contrast, they argued Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake's rise to the presidency represents 
a truer break from the elite, marking him 
as the only leader to fully challenge the 
deeply entrenched power structure from a 
grassroots background. For many, Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake's election represents a 
monumental shift away from the dominance 
of Sri Lanka's traditional political elite—a 
group whose tight grip on power has coincided 
with years of economic hardship and growing 
public disillusionment. 
In the recently concluded presidential 
election, Anura Kumara Dissanayake secured 
an impressive 5.6 million votes, with large 
segments of his support coming from youth 
and first-time voters, drawn to his message 
of reform and renewal. This surge in support 
marks a dramatic shift from his performance 
in the 2019 presidential election, where 
he garnered only 418,553 votes, dwarfed 
by Gotabaya Rajapaksa's commanding 6.9 
million.
Even more striking is that a significant portion 
of the 6.9 million voters who once backed 
Gotabaya—who openly attributed his victory 
to the overwhelming support of the Sinhala 
electorate—shifted their allegiance to Anura 
Kumara this time. How did an electorate that 
overwhelmingly voted for a Sinhala nationalist 
strongman suddenly embrace a Marxist-
Leninist candidate? The answer lies in the 
JVP's astute, evolving strategy, which tapped 
into the frustrations and aspirations of a 
disillusioned populace hungry for change.
A full-time JVP worker, speaking to Jaffna 
Monitor, explained that the victory wasn't 
about the triumph of Marxist-Leninist 
ideology. "Let's be honest, people didn't vote 
for our ideology," he said with a chuckle, 
even questioning whether most voters could 
spell Marxist-Leninist. The real driving force 
behind the JVP's success, he emphasized, was 
the people's thirst for change—change from 
rampant corruption and a break from the 
stagnant politics that have gripped Sri Lanka 
since independence.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the JVP

leadership are acutely aware of this reality. 
Many of those who voted for them this time 
had previously backed Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 
not because they suddenly embraced leftist 
ideology, but because they were desperate for 
something different. "Claiming this as a victory 
for Marxism-Leninism is irrelevant," he added. 
This is precisely why none of the JVP leaders, 
including Dissanayake, framed the win as an 
ideological triumph. Instead, they understood 
it as a mandate for change, a response to the 
people's plea for a new path forward.
Another JVP activist candidly told Jaffna 
Monitor, "We know the vote wasn't just for the 
JVP. "If Anura had run solely on the JVP ticket, 
his chances would have been slim." He pointed 
out that the older generation still carries 
the painful memories of the JVP's violent 
insurrection from 1988 to 1989. "Those dark 
days are hard to forget," he admitted.
"But we played it smart," he added, explaining 
how the JVP's success in this election hinged 
on forming the National People's Power (NPP) 
alliance. This strategic move allowed the party 
to distance itself from its troubled past and 
project a fresh, inclusive image.
"We created the NPP coalition with like-
minded individuals," a JVP leader elaborated. 
"These were intellectuals, professionals, 
patriots, and people fed up with racism and 
corruption—citizens who were completely 
disillusioned with the current political system 
but genuinely wanted to help build a better 
nation. Many of them wouldn't have joined 
us if we'd approached them under the JVP 
banner, but when we broadened our scope and 
formed the NPP in 2019, they were more than 
willing to align with us."
Another JVP insider acknowledged that some 
potential allies were hesitant to join the JVP 
due to its violent past, while others were wary 
of the party's strict internal rules, such as bans 
on smoking and drinking. "Some didn't want 
to be restricted by those kinds of regulations," 
he admitted. "But by forming the NPP, we 
found common ground. We gave them a 
platform to work with us for the greater good 
without forcing them to fully conform to the 
JVP's rigid structure."
The NPP is an amalgamation of 21 groups, 
including political parties, youth organizations, 
women's groups, trade unions, and civil society 
organizations," he explained. "It gave us the 
flexibility to bring together people who shared 
our vision for a just and inclusive Sri Lanka, 
even if they didn't fit into the traditional JVP 
mould." He admitted that the JVP wouldn't

have made it this far had it strictly adhered to 
Marxist-Leninist ideology. "This open-minded 
approach is what attracted intellectuals like 
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya to join us through the 
NPP's National Intellectuals Organization.
"We made sure to treat them well," he 
continued. "In the last parliamentary election, 
we had just two elected representatives: 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake from Colombo 
and Vijitha Herath from Gampaha. We also 
secured a national list seat, which we gave to 
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya. Not only was she 
not part of the JVP, but she identifies more 
as a liberal than as a Marxist-Leninist. When 
Anura became president, he appointed her 
as prime minister. Both times, we could have 
easily chosen someone from our own ranks, 
but we didn't. We recognized the importance 
of honoring the broader spirit of the NPP," a 
JVP source shared.
This move, he explained, allowed the party to 
reach beyond its traditional base and attract 
a more diverse, hopeful electorate. Many 
voters, who might have been hesitant to 
support a strictly Marxist-Leninist platform, 
found reassurance in the NPP's inclusive 
and pragmatic approach. "By showing that 
we're not just about ideology but about real, 
inclusive leadership, we were able to create 
a platform for change that resonated with a 
much wider audience," he emphasized.
Though the JVP has rebranded itself through 
the NPP, downplaying its Marxist-Leninist 
ideology in public, its real strength lies in the 
dedication of its full-time workers—an army 
of committed individuals who have sacrificed 
jobs, comforts, and personal lives in service 
to the party's core ideals. "They've given up 
everything for Marxist-Leninist principles," 
said a JVP leader who preferred to remain 
anonymous. "For them, ideology comes above 
all else. These workers are our greatest asset."
He further explained that the party's enduring 
success is deeply rooted in this unwavering 
ideological commitment. "You can't expect 
people to dedicate their lives, asking for 
nothing in return, unless they're driven by 
something bigger than themselves. These 
workers believe in Marxist-Leninist ideals, and 
that belief is what powers our movement," he 
emphasized.
He explained that while the JVP has left 
its militant past behind, its organizational 
structure remains as disciplined and efficient 
as ever. "It's no longer about violence, but our 
structure is still as sharp and organized as an 
efficient militant group," he remarked. The 
party now operates like a well-oiled machine, 
with full-time workers moving largely under 
the radar. "They don't flaunt their affiliations; 
instead, they quietly work at the grassroots 
level, building our foundation from the bottom 
up."
The leader emphasized the secretive, low-
profile nature of this network, noting, 
"You won't see them boasting about their 
involvement, but they are everywhere, making

things happen." He pointed out that the 
devotion of these individuals is unparalleled 
in Sri Lankan politics. "Show me another 
political party with workers who give so much, 
expecting nothing in return," he challenged.
This silent, relentless commitment, he believes, 
is the JVP's most powerful asset, and it has 
seamlessly translated into the NPP's growing 
strength. While the NPP presents itself as a 
modern, broad-based political movement, the 
heart of its success beats with the unwavering 
dedication of these full-time Marxist-Leninist 
workers. "Their behind-the-scenes efforts have 
quietly but decisively built the foundation for 
the NPP's rise," he added.
A political observer, speaking with Jaffna 
Monitor, noted that in most elections, the 
main opposition party typically capitalizes 
on the anti-incumbency factor to gain an 
advantage. However, the NPP took a different 
approach this time, launching a bold campaign 
that held every party since independence 
accountable for Sri Lanka's troubles. This 
strategy not only targeted the ruling party but 
also placed the main opposition, the SJB, and 
then-President and presidential candidate 
Ranil Wickremesinghe in an uncomfortable 
position.
The two defining and well-crafted slogans of 
the campaign—"Everyone is a thief" ("Okama 
Horu") and "The country belongs to Anura" 
("Ratta Anurata")—resonated strongly with 
over 5.6 million voters, who embraced these 
messages as undeniable truths. Even more 
remarkable, the observer added, was the 
manner in which the victory was received. 
Rather than loud ceremonies, flashy parades, 
or grand celebrations, the people who 
propelled this win welcomed it with calm and 
self-discipline.

"More than just ideology and strategy, it was 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's (AKD) personal 
brand that also fueled his rise to power," a 
political commentator told Jaffna Monitor. 
Over the past decade, AKD systematically built 
his reputation as a clean politician with zero 
tolerance for corruption. His personal brand of 
incorruptibility resonated deeply with voters, 
particularly the younger generation, who had 
grown disillusioned by decades of political 
graft and mismanagement.
Since taking over the JVP leadership ten years 
ago, AKD had made it his mission to distance 
the party from its past as a radical Marxist 
militant group. In an unprecedented move, he 
even publicly issued an apology for the first 
time in the party's history, acknowledging 
the JVP's responsibility for over 6,000 deaths 
during the 1988–89 insurrection. It was a 
bold gesture aimed at turning a new page, but 
insiders say it didn't sit well with the JVP's 
Politburo. Faced with internal pushback, 
AKD subtly shifted his tone, opting to 
express "regret" instead in subsequent public 
statements.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's swearing-in 
ceremony reflected the understated tone his 
leadership promised, a political observer 
told Jaffna Monitor. 'It was as unassuming 
as a routine administrative oath-taking,' he 
remarked. 'We didn't just talk about "system 
change"; we embodied it, starting from the 
very moment AKD took office. The ceremony 
itself was marked by simplicity—attendees, 
including foreign dignitaries, were provided 
nothing more than basic water bottles. There 
were no grand rallies, no lavish celebrations. 
Our jubilant members paused only briefly to 
acknowledge the moment before returning 
to their work—just as our new president did,' 
a JVP leader proudly recounted to Jaffna 
Monitor.
The next two to three years are poised to be 
a transformative period for Sri Lanka as it 
embarks on a new political path, a political 
observer told Jaffna Monitor. "This journey is 
unlikely to be smooth. We can expect intense 
clashes between those pushing for change 
and those clinging to the status quo, as well as 
fierce battles between left-wing and right-wing 
factions," he remarked.
For years, the JVP—and later, its alliance, the 
NPP—was largely seen as a force of resistance, 
a protest-driven movement. "They've got 
the cadres, the machinery, and the ability to 
mobilize mass protests in mere hours. But now, 
the tables have turned. In power, they'll have to 
grapple with the gritty realities of governance," 
he added.
A significant hurdle looming on the horizon 
will be managing tensions with former allies 
like the Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) and the 
Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF), 
not to mention contending with right-wing 
parties and associations. What was once a 
coalition of the discontented may soon find 
itself fracturing under the weight of power.
Reflecting on the broader political landscape, a 
seasoned observer likened the seismic shift of 
2024, marked by Anura Kumara Dissanayake's 
ascent to power, to the unexpected rise of 
the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi in 2013. "This 
new wave," he noted, "holds the potential to 
unlock doors long barred to ordinary citizens, 
especially within the corridors of Colombo's 
power structure. If the NPP can deliver on 
their promises, they might well usher in an era 
of prosperity the nation has only dreamed of. 
But how Anura Kumara Dissanayake and his 
team navigate these newfound opportunities 
and how they handle the intoxicating allure 
of power that has eluded them for decades 
remains the real test.
