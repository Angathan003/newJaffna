Amidst this political comedy of errors, 
ITAK's self-proclaimed knight in shining 
armour, M.A. Sumanthiran, gallantly 
attempted to ride in and save the day. His 
grand solution to the mess? Launch a 
special edition newspaper to "clarify" ITAK's 
position! The paper was edited by a well-
respected Tamil editor from Jaffna—a man 
who was already juggling morning and 
evening newspapers like a seasoned circus 
performer. Word had it that a few thousand 
copies of this special edition were printed 
and sent out to the farthest reaches of ITAK's 
political strongholds.
In an almost theatrical twist, during a 
campaign rally in Manipay, Jaffna, attended 
by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, 
Sumanthiran ceremoniously handed over 
the newspaper to Sajith Premadasa, making 
quite the show of it. The best part? The 
newspaper was distributed free of charge 
to the rally-goers as if to ensure that no 
one missed out on the latest episode of 
Sumanthiran's political soap opera.

The articles in the newspaper 
included pieces such as "Why 
ITAK Supports Sajith," "Why 
Ranil Must Be Defeated," 
and "The Tamil Common 
Candidate: A Political Suicide."
But here's where the whole 
thing took a hilariously 
bizarre turn. Instead of 
a title that evoked unity 
or political gravitas, the 
newspaper was called… wait 
for it… Sumanthiram. Yes, 
Sumanthiran named the entire 
paper after himself. And if that 
wasn't narcissistic enough, 
the logo featured none other 
than a smiling caricature of 
Sumanthiran himself, as if 
to say, "Look at me! I'm the 
solution!"
The moment the newspaper hit 
the streets, it was like handing 
out punchlines instead of 
political guidance. Instead of 
clarifying ITAK's position, 
the whole exercise became the 
punchline of every political 
joke in town. Supporters didn't 
know whether to laugh or cry. 
Questions started flying: "If 
they really wanted clarity, why 
didn't they just reprint the now-
defunct Suthanthiran, ITAK's 
official newspaper? Why the 
need for such self-glorification?"
Instead of rallying ITAK's 
confused base, Sumanthiram 
blew up in Sumanthiran's face 
like a botched magic trick. 
Voters, already worn out by the party's endless clown 
show, took one look at the newspaper and saw it for what 
it was—a shiny, oversized tribute to Sumanthiran's ego. 
According to sources, a few disillusioned supporters, lost 
in a fog of political despair, ended up voting for Sangu (the 
conch), the symbol of the common Tamil candidate. The 
punchline? This was the very candidate Sumanthiran had 
passionately warned everyone not to support.
Rather than rescuing ITAK from the edge of disaster, 
Sumanthiram turned the party's crisis into a full-
blown political comedy of Shakespearean proportions. 
What started as an attempt to "clarify" ITAK's stance 
quickly spiraled into an unintentional farce, revealing 
Sumanthiran's ego to be as inflated as a hot air balloon, 
while his and the party's credibility plummeted faster than 
the newspaper circulation. The election may be long over, 
but the legend of Sumanthiram—the paper, not the man—
still lives on as one of the most jaw-dropping spectacles in 
the grand circus of Tamil political theatre.

M
ore than three decades after their forced 
eviction from the Northern Province, 
thousands of Muslim families who returned 
to their ancestral lands in Jaffna still face an 
uncertain future, living in temporary shelters 
without permanent homes or basic amenities. 
Despite their hopes of resettling, these families 
remain trapped in a cycle of hardship, with 
little progress made on housing or land 
allocation.
In a poignant reflection of their ongoing 
struggles, Sharmina Sahabdeen, a third-gener 
ation Muslim originally from  Pommaiveli 
near Jaffna, recounted her return to Jaffna on 
September 16, 2002, with optimism. "We came 
back with immeasurable joy, thinking we were 
finally returning home. But 22 years later, we 
still don't have permanent land or homes. Our 
lives are confined to temporary tin-roofed 
shacks," she said.

Sharmina is one of many who returned to their ancestral 
land only to find themselves living in makeshift homes 
with no access to basic infrastructure. "Our daily life 
revolves around public toilets, community wells, and 
water supply limited to just an hour a day. The heat inside 
the shacks is unbearable in the dry season, and during 
the rainy season, we deal with waist-deep floods," she 
explained.
Her story is not unique. Sharmina also shared the tragic 
story of losing her mother during the floods. "When the 
floods hit last time, my mother fell ill and contracted an 
infection, according to the doctors. Despite treatments, 
she passed away," she said tearfully.
16 Years On, Still No Permanent Homes
Katheeja, another returnee, spoke of her family's 
displacement during the 1990 eviction and their 
subsequent struggle to resettle. "We were expelled from 
Jaffna and went to Puttalam. We returned to Jaffna 16 
years ago, but we still haven't been 
able to identify land or obtain 
the necessary documents. That's 
why we're still living in these 
temporary huts," she said.
Though many families have 
returned, they continue to 
face bureaucratic challenges in 
securing land. "We manage in 
these huts, but our children suffer 
the most. Their education is 
constantly disrupted by the floods. 
Our time may have passed, but for 
our children's future, education 
is the key. Yet, the environment 
doesn't allow them to study 
properly," she added, expressing 
her frustration.
Despite returning more than 15 
years ago, 278 families remain 
unable to build permanent homes 
or benefit from government 
housing schemes. They reside 
in rented houses in and around 
Jaffna, while others, without 
opportunities to construct homes, 
have relocated elsewhere in the 
country.
Historical Displacement and 
Unfulfilled Promises
The expulsion of Muslims from 
the Northern Province in October 
1990 remains one of the darkest 
chapters in the region's history. 
Over a two-week period, the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) forced out approximately 
14,400 Muslim families (about 5% 
of the province's population) from 
their homes. Families left behind 
their properties and belongings, 
fleeing with just 500 rupees and

the clothes on their backs, as they crossed the 
boundaries of the Northern Province.
Many of these displaced families are scattered 
across the country, with some settling in areas 
such as Puttalam, Negombo, and Panadura. 
Only a few sought refuge abroad. Despite 
returning to their homeland, many of these 
families still struggle to secure permanent 
resettlement and housing.
The issue is compounded by bureaucratic 
hurdles and the lack of adequate land 
allocation. "When we were displaced in 1990, 
there were 3,500 families. Now, our numbers 
have grown to 15,000. Yet, only about 1,000 
families have returned, and just 250 families 
have received housing schemes. What 
happened to the rest of us?" asked a young man 
from the resettled community in  Pommaiveli, 
who requested anonymity.
Continued Hardships
While 278 families continue to live in rented 
houses without their own land, others, despite 
owning ancestral land, cannot build homes due 
to building regulations. Urban Development 
Authority rules require at least six and a half 
perches of land to construct a house, but many 
Muslim families have less than this, and thus 
cannot build homes for their growing families.
The situation is dire for younger generations, 
who find themselves living in overcrowded 
conditions with no prospect of housing 
support. Many families now face the possibility 
of being displaced once again, as they lack the 
resources to improve their living conditions.
Calls for Action
Muslim community leaders and activists have 
been calling for more robust action from 
the government to address these issues. The 
Muslim Peace Secretariat has put forward an 
11-point proposal, urging the government 
to expedite resettlement efforts and provide 
necessary housing and land support to 
displaced Muslims.
Some of the key demands include:
The establishment of a Presidential 
Commission to investigate the forced eviction 
of Muslims in 1990 and recommend necessary 
reparations.
Prioritizing housing assistance for the 
displaced Muslim community.
Ensuring that displaced Muslims retain 
ownership of their ancestral lands.
Increasing compensation for those affected by 
the 1990 expulsion.
Despite these demands being put forward 
two years ago, there has been little progress 
in implementing the proposals, leaving the 
displaced community in limbo.
A Bleak Future
Human rights activist Shreen Saroor 
highlighted the failures in the resettlement 
process, stating, "Resettlement is seen as a 
favor, not as a right. For years, the resettlement 
of Muslims has been delayed due to issues 
related to land ownership. It took nearly 
ten years to establish an office for displaced 
Muslims in Puttalam. Despite multiple housing 
schemes, such as the 50,000 Indian Housing 
Project, strict eligibility criteria have left 
many affected families without access to these 
resources."
As more than 1,490 families express their 
desire to return to Jaffna, the government 
faces increasing pressure to address the land 
and housing crisis for the displaced Muslim 
population. Yet, without substantial action, 
the long-held dream of resettlement remains a 
mirage for many.
