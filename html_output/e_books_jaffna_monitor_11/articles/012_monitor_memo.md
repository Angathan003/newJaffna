uch to the relief of many in Jaffna, Jaffna 
District MP and former Justice C.V. 
Wigneswaran has announced that he will not 
be contesting in the upcoming parliamentary 
elections. However, before anyone celebrates, 
there's a twist—he's not entirely stepping away 
from politics. At the "youthful" age of 84, 
Wigneswaran is presenting his decision as a 
grand "sacrifice" for the benefit of the younger 
generation. While most people his age might 
be enjoying their retirement, Wigneswaran 
seems determined to continue serving, defying 
expectations.
In a press release, Wigneswaran framed his 
exit from the election race as an act of pure 
altruism. He explained that he is graciously 
stepping aside to give the youth their much-
deserved opportunity in the political spotlight. 
The timing is noteworthy—after all, when 
he last contested the parliamentary elections 
in 2020, he was already 80 years old. Fast-
forward four years, and now, Wigneswaran has 
seemingly realized that maybe it's time to let 
the younger generation take the reins.
But don't think for a moment that 
Wigneswaran is disappearing from the 
political scene. Instead, he appears to be taking 
on the role of a political elder statesman, 
ensuring his influence continues to shape 
Tamil politics.
