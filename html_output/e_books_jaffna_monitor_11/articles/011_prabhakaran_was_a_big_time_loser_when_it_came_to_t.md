Prabhakaran Was a 
Big-Time Loser When 
It Came to Targeting Me: 
Douglas Devananda 
Part-2

Our Reporter
How would you address the political 
parties and Tamil leaders who 
continue to align themselves with 
the ideology of the Tigers in today's 
context?
The ideology of the Tigers, that of their 
leader Prabhakaran, is not only defeated but 
also outdated. Those who claim to adhere to 
it now are simply engaging in opportunistic, 
vote-grabbing politics. A prime example 
of this is the Tamil National People's Front 
(TNPF).
Its MP, Gajendran, used to grandstand 
in Parliament, even throwing books and 
files at me during the height of the Tigers' 
influence. Yet, in person, he would act in a 
completely subdued manner.

At one point in Parliament, he made the 
provocative statement that 40,000 coffins 
should be prepared because the LTTE would 
eliminate that many Sinhala soldiers in the 
North. This caused significant anger among 
the people and politicians in southern Sri 
Lanka. However, despite all this bravado, what 
did Gajendran do during the final stages of the 
war? He fled abroad, got married, and after the 
conflict ended, brokered a deal with Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa, the then Defence Secretary, to 
return to Sri Lanka. He even managed to 
secure the release of his brother, who had been 
detained by the Sri Lankan government.
This sums up the true nature of politicians who 
claim to follow the Tigers' ideology. They use it 
as a convenient facade while pursuing personal 
gains. We didn't choose that path, did we?
To the parties and politicians who proudly 
thump their chests, claiming to follow the 
LTTE and its leader's ideology, I would like 
to remind them that this mindless, violent 
ideology dragged thousands of innocent 
Tamils to Mullivaikal and was the primary 
cause of our people's suffering. If you continue 
to cling to it, you will one day be defeated not 
by external forces but by our own people.
While other Tamil leaders, especially 
those from militant groups, either 
fled abroad in fear of Prabhakaran 
or surrendered and became mere 
mouthpieces of the LTTE, what gave 
you the courage to stand against him?
I saw Prabhakaran as a poisonous entity—
like a venomous insect whose very presence 
was harmful to everyone around him. I 
truly believed the world would be better off 
without him. However, I held no personal 
grudge against the ordinary Tiger fighters; 
they were merely misled. My conviction only 
grew stronger as I watched Prabhakaran kill 
many of my close relatives, comrades, friends 
and associates, which further solidified my 
determination to stay in this country and 
oppose his destructive policies.
The Tigers had a reputation for 
eliminating anyone who stood in their 
way.  LTTE sources we've spoken to 
mentioned that, while Prabhakaran 
tried to have you killed, his inability 
to do so eventually earned you a 
grudging respect from him. A writer 
even remarked that Prabhakaran's 
biggest failure was Douglas 
Devananda. So, how did Prabhakaran 
fail to get you? And how did you 
manage to escape his grasp?
I was absolutely convinced that Prabhakaran 
couldn't kill me—nor would I ever die by 
his hands. This wasn't just blind faith; I took 
every precaution to protect myself. I knew, 
without a shred of doubt, that I couldn't trust 
Prabhakaran or his Tigers—not even 0.0001%. 
That's why I'm still alive today. There's a 
Tamil saying, 'Only a snake knows another 
snake's legs,' and I had a deep understanding 
of how Prabhakaran operated—his mindset, 
his tactics. I could anticipate his every move, 
which always kept me one step ahead. For 
example, I developed the habit of sleeping 
while remaining alert to the faintest vibrations 
in the ground, aware that the LTTE could 
be tunnelling beneath me at any moment. 
Constantly changing my location also made it 
nearly impossible for them to target me.
When I lived on Park Road in Colombo, we set

up security sentries around the house. At that time, 
some members of my party, including 
Chandrakumar, suggested that since 
we had embraced the democratic 
path, such security measures were no 
longer necessary. However, my goal 
wasn't to prepare for an attack but to 
ensure that the Tigers knew we were 
always on high alert. This would make 
them think twice before attempting 
anything. Without these precautions, 
we would only realize they were upon 
us when it was too late.
Let me give you another example. Around this 
time, false rumours were spread by Chandrika 
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and others, claiming 
that we were armed hitmen for Premadasa, 
plotting to assassinate her and her mother. These 
baseless accusations created immense pressure, 
forcing us to leave Park Road. Unable to 
possess weapons for self-defense in Colombo, 
we had to surrender the few firearms we 
had. We then moved to Trincomalee with 
plans to head to the Jaffna islands. While 
waiting for a ship, we received the news 
that Premadasa had been assassinated by 
the Tigers.
After that, we returned to Colombo. I was 
convinced that I needed to stay in the capital and 
establish a base there, as I believed it would allow me 
to better address the issues and concerns of the Tamil 
people. We came back to Colombo and ended up 
staying covertly in a house in Havelock Town. This 
time, there were no sentries or security systems in 
place.
That's when the Tigers launched their first commando 
attack in Colombo. Without any sensors or early 
warnings, we only realized the attack was happening 
when they were at our doorstep. Tragically, four of 
my comrades lost their lives in that attack. However, 
thanks to the precautions I had taken, eight of us,

including myself, managed to escape. Despite 
the sophisticated weaponry the LTTE used in 
the assault, we survived. Had we maintained 
the level of security we had on Park Road, such 
an attack might have been thwarted.
How did the LTTE manage to carry 
out such a bold attack in the heart 
of Colombo—especially their first 
commando operation in the capital? 
Military commanders we've spoken to 
have said that escaping an attack of 
that magnitude was nearly impossible. 
So, how did the attack unfold, and how 
did you manage to escape unharmed?
The Tigers used someone I knew personally to 
gather intelligence for that attack. He was from 
Ariyalai, Jaffna—someone I had known for a 
long time. Back when my father worked for the 
Petroleum Corporation, this man used to sell 
kerosene door-to-door with a small cart.
He came to my home in Colombo and, during 
that visit, passed on precise details about the 
house—both the interior and exterior—to the 
LTTE. Later, he returned, showed me the scars 
on his back, and apologized. He explained 
that the Tigers had brutally tortured him and 
forced him into betraying me.
I typically met people in a small room 
downstairs in the house, and the informant 
had told the Tigers that this was where I 
stayed. So, they specifically targeted that room 
with grenades, bullets, and rocket launchers, 
believing I would be there. However, what they 
didn't know was that I never stayed there.
Wherever I stayed, I always had a secret 
escape route, regardless of the location. 
While the Tigers were attacking, bombarding 
the building with bullets and grenades, my 
comrades and I managed to escape. The 
Tigers, however, believed they had succeeded, 
convinced that I had been killed.
I stayed silent for a few hours, allowing the 
LTTE and their supporters to celebrate (he 
laughs), thinking they had finally eliminated 
me. After some time, I picked up the phone 
and called President Chandrika Bandaranaike 
Kumaratunga to inform her that I was still 
alive. Even she had believed I was dead until I 
made that call.
A senior Journalist once claimed that I was 
calmly eating Idiyappa Kottu (or String 
Hopper Kottu) and drinking coffee when 
the surprise attack began. But in reality, I 
don't drink coffee or tea at all. Many writers 
embellish such details for dramatic effect, 
but the truth is quite different. At that time, 
for security reasons, we never ate food from 
outside—everything was cooked at home 
to ensure safety. As you asked earlier, one 
Saiva religious preacher even accused me of 
operating like a militant leader. In truth, it was 
my survival instinct and preparedness—much 
like that of a militant leader—that saved my 
life that day and during many other attacks.
The next morning, you gave an 
interview to a prominent news agency, 
stating, 'Prabhakaran can't kill me.' Do 
you remember making that statement?
Yes, yes. I said it because it was true—
Prabhakaran tried multiple times to eliminate 
me. He sent two suicide bombers and even 
orchestrated a brutal attack on me at Kalutara 
Prison, but he couldn't kill me. When it came 
to targeting me, he was a big-time loser.
Prabhakaran operated entirely from the

shadows, always hidden behind layers of 
bunkers and security. He never participated in 
battles himself, nor did he openly meet people. 
In fact, he wouldn't even meet his own LTTE 
guards without thoroughly screening and 
checking them first. He lived in constant fear, 
always shielded from danger.
In contrast, ever since I chose the democratic 
path, I have lived openly among the people. 
Even during the height of the Tigers' attempts 
to kill me, I never went into hiding. I 
continued to meet hundreds of people 
daily, never letting fear dictate my 
actions. In my Jaffna office, I met 
thousands of people daily.
Now, ask yourself: who 
showed more courage—
Prabhakaran, who 
hid in bunkers and 
ordered bombings and killings, or me, who 
faced the world every day despite numerous 
assassination attempts, never running, never 
hiding?
During Prabhakaran's peak, when he 
was revered as the "Sun God" and 
managed to rally the majority of Tamils 
behind him—whether through fear 
or manipulation—did you foresee his 
defeat?
Absolutely. I always believed that Prabhakaran 
could be defeated, and I was certain the 
world would be a better place without him. 
My anger towards him wasn't solely because 
he murdered my brother, Premanandha, or 
killed close relatives, associates like Maheswari 
Velayutham, and comrades like Bala Nadaraja 
Iyer, among many others. It stemmed from 
the fact that he was the primary cause of our 
people's suffering. Every hardship the Tamil 
people endured, both past and present, could 
be traced back to Prabhakaran's actions.
Is there a particular killing of someone 
close to you by Prabhakaran that 
deeply affected you?
Each one of those murders brought me deep 
sorrow. There was no hierarchy in the pain 
they caused me. But those deaths fueled my 
resolve even further. They filled me with 
an unshakable determination to stay here, 
among my people, and resist Prabhakaran's 
fascism from within our own land. Many 
of my relatives and friends living abroad 
urged me to leave everything and join them. 
Some even suggested that I align myself with 
Prabhakaran. But I refused.
I remember when Soosai, the former LTTE 
Sea Tiger commander, once claimed that no 
one could ever get close to Prabhakaran, and 
if they did, not even grass would grow within

a 10-kilometer radius. But look at how it all 
ended. Prabhakaran, who was once feared and 
seen as invincible, was killed like a coward in 
the waters of Nandikadal. I always knew this 
would be his fate.
Recently, I visited Mullaitivu. Prabhakaran 
could never have imagined, even in his wildest 
dreams, that he would one day be killed and 
that I would walk freely through Mullaitivu, 
working to help the very people he once 
terrorized.
What was the reason for 
Chandrakumar, who was once close to 
you, splitting off to form his own party?
I had initially intended for Chandrakumar to 
succeed me as the leader of the party. He was 
intelligent and capable, and I began preparing 
him for that role. However, those around 
him began to mislead and confuse him. After 
the war, he became involved with pro-Tiger 
elements. My visits to Kilinochchi, the Tigers' 
stronghold, where I spoke out against the 
LTTE, didn't sit well with these groups. They 
influenced Chandrakumar, and unfortunately, 
he fell into their orbit.
Even in the late 1990s, out of fear of the Tigers, 
Chandrakumar distanced himself from me 
and the country, taking some of my closest 
comrades abroad with him. When he tried 
to reconnect with me after the war, one of 
my early comrades—whom I had raised like 
a younger brother—returned from abroad 
and warned me not to trust him. He revealed 
that Chandrakumar had been responsible for 
taking him away in the first place and couldn't 
be relied upon. Despite this warning, I placed 
my trust in Chandrakumar once again, but 
ultimately, I was proven wrong.
How were negative perceptions about 
you planted among a large number of 
people?

It was largely the result of false propaganda. 
The Tigers went to great lengths to portray 
me as a villain—depicting me as some kind 
of monster with horns and sharp fangs. They 
carefully crafted a narrative that painted me 
as a brutal figure. Unfortunately, many media 
outlets, driven by fear of the Tigers, chose to 
spread these falsehoods. This caused a large 
number of innocent people who had never 
even met me to believe these distorted stories 
and view me in a negative light.
I never felt the need to aggressively counter 
this narrative or promote myself because I 
always believed my actions and principles 
would speak louder than any propaganda. And 
let's not forget that the Tamil people continued 
to elect me to Parliament for over 30 years. If 
I had truly been the kind of person the Tigers 
and their supporters claimed, that would 
have never happened. The trust of the people 
ultimately reveals the truth, not the false 
rumors spread by those with an agenda.
In the recent presidential election, 
the candidate you supported, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, was defeated. 
How do you view this outcome? 
Additionally, at the time of the first part 
of this interview, you were a senior 
member of the government and the 
Cabinet Minister of Fisheries. Now that 
you're no longer in that position, how 
do you feel about this change?
We made a bold and strategic choice to 
support Ranil Wickremesinghe, keeping in 
mind the aspirations of the Tamil-speaking 
people and the broader economic challenges 
the country faces. While the majority of Sri 
Lankans opted for change, I fully respect their 
democratic will. At the same time, I remain 
optimistic that the newly elected President, 
Comrade Anura Kumara Dissanayake, will 
pursue his vision of creating a more equitable 
society and addressing the hopes of all citizens.
As for my position as Minister of Fisheries—
titles come and go, but my commitment to 
the people remains steadfast. Whether I hold 
office or not is secondary to me. I sincerely 
thank those who have supported our political 
journey. For decades, I've worked with an 
unwavering dedication to serving the people, 
always prioritizing national reconciliation and 
progress. Holding office doesn't define my 
work—it's the values and vision I stand for that 
matter most.
What motivates you to remain involved 
in politics?
I was among those who initiated the armed 
struggle, and in some ways, I feel a sense 
of responsibility for the current challenges 
my people face. I bear a moral duty to 
continue working for their well-being. Like 
other leaders, I could have surrendered to 
Prabhakaran, fled abroad, or simply stepped 
away and remained inactive in the country. 
But my connection to these people runs much 
deeper than that.
I feel a profound emotional bond with 
them, and abandoning them in their time of 
need was never an option. I believe it's my 
responsibility to stay with them, working 
towards a future where their struggles are 
eased. Whether I hold office or not, I am 
driven by a deep commitment to seeing our 
people flourish and overcome the hardships 
that have plagued them for so long.
The End.
