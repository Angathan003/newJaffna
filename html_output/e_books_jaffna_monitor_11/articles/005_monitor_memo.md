n a surprising revelation, it has come to 
light that a liquor license for the "A-9 Wine 
Store," located at Karadipokku Junction in 
Kilinochchi, was secured through the influence 
of Tamil People’s National Alliance leader and 
former Northern Province Chief Minister, 
C.V. Wigneswaran. This has raised serious 
questions about the integrity of a leader who 
has long portrayed himself as the torchbearer 
of righteousness.
Wigneswaran, often presenting himself as 
a staunch advocate of justice and morality, 
has left many bewildered by this latest 
development. The question on everyone's 
mind is: How could a self-proclaimed, proud 
Saivaite—who claims to champion religious 
and moral values, and urges others to follow 
suit—stoop to securing a bar permit?
“C.V. Wigneswaran is the last person we’d

expect to facilitate a liquor 
business,” remarked a 
political observer. “For a 
man who professes such 
strong religious beliefs, 
securing a liquor license 
contradicts the very 
principles he claims to 
uphold.
 What makes this situation 
even more perplexing is 
that Wigneswaran justified 
his actions by claiming the 
permit was obtained to 
help an orphaned woman, 
Thanusha Nadarasa, who 
had lost both her parents. 
“I obtained the license for 
a woman who had lost 
both her parents, not for 
myself,” Wigneswaran 
said when confronted 
about the matter. But 
critics argue that if his true 
intention was to help this 
orphaned woman, there 
are countless other ways 
he could have extended 
support. “Does helping 
an orphan really require 
setting her up with a bar 
permit?” asked a member 
of the public, raising 
doubts about the noble 
intentions behind the 
move. 
 While Wigneswaran 
tries to paint this as 
a compassionate act, 
sources indicate that the 
situation might not be as 
straightforward. Whispers 
from within political 
circles suggest that this particular permit may have come with a 
hefty reward—but only time will tell if there’s more to this ‘gesture’ 
than meets the eye. 
 It’s also worth noting that under then-President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe’s administration, 172 liquor licenses were 
granted, with this particular one standing out due to its 
association with Wigneswaran. For a man who once spoke about 
“changing the system,” he seems to be getting rather comfortable 
with it.
