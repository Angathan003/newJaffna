Steering the Nation Forward: An 
Era of Responsibility Begins!
O
n behalf of Jaffna Monitor, we congratulate Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake on his historic election as the President of 
Sri Lanka. His ascension to the highest office represents a 
monumental shift, marking a rare departure from the entrenched 
power structures that have long dominated the political 
landscape.
For the first time in recent memory, the insidious rhetoric 
of racial and religious divisiveness did not dominate the 
Sinhala-majority candidates' campaigns. Even fringe elements, 
historically prone to inflaming sectarian tensions, refrained 
from exploiting such incendiary tactics.
However, it is disheartening to observe that while Sinhala 
political discourse has matured beyond ethnic fault lines, 
segments of Tamil political rhetoric have regressed into 
Tamil racism. A faction of diaspora-funded troublemakers, 
masquerading as champions of community interests, rallied 
behind the 'Tamil candidate' and openly espoused the notion 
that Tamils must exclusively vote for Tamil candidates. Worse 
still, they promulgated a dangerous narrative that "authentic" 
Tamils, born of both Tamil parents, should vote for Tamil 
representatives. This ethnocentric myopia is not only divisive 
but a pernicious form of the very racism they claim to abhor.
The hypocrisy of such posturing is deeply troubling. Those who 
have historically condemned Sinhala racism must themselves be 
held to account when they incite Tamil chauvinism for electoral 
gain. While the majority of the Tamil electorate repudiated 
these divisive tactics, over 225,000 votes garnered through this 
regressive rhetoric warrant serious introspection within Tamil 
society.
Tamils must recognize the dangers of this form of political 
regression. Resorting to ethnic chauvinism in any guise is a

retrograde step for our political culture. Our 
focus must remain on nurturing a future where 
leaders are elected for their merit, vision, and 
moral integrity—not their ethnic identity. 
While it is heartening that the majority of 
Tamil voters rejected this brand of politics, 
the persistence of such rhetoric among some 
remains a red flag. As a society, we must 
remain vigilant in ensuring that we continue 
on the path of unity and inclusivity.
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's victory is 
noteworthy not just for what it symbolizes 
but for what it pragmatically represents. He 
did not achieve the 50% threshold needed for 
a sweeping mandate, a reality he candidly 
acknowledged in his inaugural address. His 
understanding of the weighty responsibility 
ahead was palpable, as he emphatically 
declared, "I will be the president for all." His 
emphasis on unity and reconciliation will 
be the cornerstone of his tenure as he seeks 
to govern beyond the narrow confines of 
electoral allegiances.
In his speech, the president also underscored a 
fundamental truth about democracy. "The most 
basic element of democracy is the election 
of leaders by the people. But democracy is 
more than just voting; it is about the perpetual 
safeguarding of institutions, the rule of 
law, and transparency." His words resonate 
with the urgency of the hour. Sri Lanka's 
democratic institutions have been battered 
by corruption, erosion of public trust, and 
a growing perception of political impunity. 
Rebuilding this trust is not merely a task—it is 
the mandate of his presidency.
The new president has inherited a country at 
a crossroads—politically disillusioned and 
economically beleaguered. Yet, in a moment 
of profound candour, he remarked, "I am not 
a magician," acknowledging the inherent 
limitations of one leader in addressing the 
multifaceted crises facing the nation. Instead, 
he envisions a collective effort, inviting 
professionals, intellectuals, and citizens from 
all walks of life to contribute to the arduous 
task of nation-building.
Anura Kumara's personal journey from 
humble beginnings as a child selling cigarettes 
on trains to the presidency of Sri Lanka is an 
inspirational testament to the possibilities that 
still exist in our country. His rise exemplifies 
the aspirations of a generation that believes in 
meritocracy, hard work, and the possibility of 
overcoming adversity.
As he embarks on this critical tenure, Anura 
Kumara must remain mindful of the immense 
expectations that accompany him. He takes 
office at a time of national reckoning, where 
the decisions made in the coming months 
will chart the course for the nation's future. 
The road ahead is fraught with challenges, 
but with the right combination of humility, 
strength, and collaborative spirit, he has the 
opportunity to recalibrate Sri Lanka's political 
and economic trajectory.
While this election may not have granted the 
new president an unequivocal mandate, it 
has provided him with something far more 
crucial—a mandate for change. It is now 
incumbent upon him to honor that trust, to 
serve all Sri Lankans, and to rebuild a nation 
yearning for renewal.
