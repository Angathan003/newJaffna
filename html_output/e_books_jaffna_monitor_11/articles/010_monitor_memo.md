T
he Election Commission has announced 
a reduction in the number of Members 
of Parliament (MPs) representing the Jaffna 
electoral district, with the total dropping from 
7 to 6. This change affects the Jaffna electoral 
district, which includes the administrative 
districts of Jaffna and Kilinochchi. In the 
upcoming general election, scheduled for 
November 14, only 6 MPs will be elected from 
the district. Similarly, Colombo has also seen a 
decrease, losing one seat and bringing its total 
from 19 to 18.
This decision by the Election Commission 
is based on voter registration data, which 
indicates a sharp decline in the voter base in 
both Jaffna and Colombo. The reduction in 
Jaffna’s representation is being linked to a mass 
migration of Tamils, particularly to countries 
like Canada. Data shows that around 20,000 
youth from Jaffna migrated to Canada in 
the past year alone, following the Canadian 
government’s relaxation of visa policies for Sri 
Lankan nationals.
Political analysts have pointed out that this 
migration crisis is rooted in long-standing 
socio-economic problems in Jaffna, which they 
argue have been largely neglected by Tamil 
nationalist politicians. “Instead of addressing 
key issues such as job creation and improving 
local infrastructure, our political leaders are 
stuck in a cycle of divisive rhetoric and identity 
politics,” one analyst remarked.
Another political observer noted that the 
strong desire among Jaffna Tamils to settle 
abroad has also contributed to this exodus. 
“For many, the idea of migrating to a foreign 
country represents hope for a better future, 
especially when local opportunities remain 
limited,” the observer added.
The impact of this migration is now being felt 
in the political arena. If this trend continues, 
experts warn that Jaffna’s representation in 
Parliament could shrink even further in future 
elections.
Local commentators argue that the solution 
lies in economic development. “Job creation 
and real economic opportunities could help 
curb migration, but these hollow speeches 
and empty promises from Tamil nationalist 
leaders are doing little to retain our youth,” a 
community leader noted. If the current rate 
of outmigration persists, Jaffna’s political 
representation may face further cuts—a stark 
warning that should push for urgent action 
beyond mere political rhetoric.
