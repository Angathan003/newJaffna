Looking Back, Moving 
Forward: Confronting Our 
History to Shape Our Future
Dear Esteemed Readers,
In our previous edition, we delved into the harrowing tale of 
the Verugal massacreâ€”an event from two decades ago where 
Tamils tragically turned on each other. This sombre episode, 
often eclipsed by other calamities in our annals, provoked 
substantial feedback. Many shared constructive insights, yet a 
few staunch LTTE adherents outright denied the occurrence 
of the Verugal massacre. Such refutations of historical horrors 
are not merely unjust; they are perilous. Consider the uproar 
should anyone negate the Kumuthini boat massacre, the Val-
vettithurai massacre, or the Navaly Church bombing. Would 
those same dissenters keep their silence or look the other 
way? This serves as a grave reminder of the injustices that 
arise when history is selectively acknowledged or intentionally 
ignored.
Adding a twist of irony, some self-proclaimed former mem-
bers of the LTTE's intelligence wing have lobbed accusations 
that our team at the Jaffna Monitor colluded with external 
forces to spotlight the Verugal massacre. These charges evoke 
images of the famously bumbling Inspector Clouseau from 
'The 'Pink Panther' series, whose detective work was comically 
misguided and consistently off the mark. If these accusers tru-
ly were the cream of the intelligence crop, one has to ponder 
how Pottu Amman managed to run a 'formidable' intelligence 
operation with such characters in the mix. It appears these 
erstwhile spies might do well to enroll in an introductory fact-
checking course rather than spinning conspiracy theories that 
could even make Clouseau himself blush with embarrassment!
Let us state this unequivocally and with profound clarity: the 
Verugal massacre was a harrowing tragedy, a bleak chapter 
where Tamils inflicted unspeakable harm upon their own. 
Both the assailants and the victims bore the same allegiance

to the LTTE. Given this truth, how can a faithful recounting of these events be 
twisted into an assault on the LTTE? How can it be branded as an anti-LTTE 
narrative when both those who perished and those who perpetrated were 
bound by the same cause? This isn't about taking sides; it's about acknowledging 
the painful realities of our shared history. 
Furthermore, we staunchly reject the oversimplified dichotomy of traitor versus 
hero that some attempt to enforce upon the narrative of our struggle. We also 
do not adhere to the prevailing notion that the actions of the LTTE leadership 
should remain beyond scrutiny. It is essential to state unequivocally that our 
role is to question. The LTTE leadership not only met its tragic demise in the 
Nanthi Kadal lagoon but also dragged hundreds of thousands of people and 
thousands of fighters into a devastating conflict with a grim and senseless end. 
These actions and decisions by the LTTE leadership must be critically examined 
and scrutinized to ensure our future generations understand what went wrong. 
If we fail to do this, we perpetrate a great injustice upon them. During their 
reign, any criticism of the LTTE leadership was met with lethal consequences. If 
we do not scrutinize their activities now, then when will we?
The Eastern fighters, whether under the banner of the LTTE or Karuna Amman, 
took up arms driven by their deep commitment to the rights of the Tamil peo-
ple. Labelling the Vanni Tigers as heroes and the entire Eastern cadre as traitors 
grossly misrepresents the complexity of their decisions and the intricate tapestry 
of our shared history. We refuse to endorse such a simplistic and unjust narra-
tive.
In this edition, we turn our attention to a critical contemporary issue: the white-
fly infestation and its significant impact on the livelihoods of Sri Lankan farm-
ers. We have delved into the extent of this agricultural crisis and discussed po-
tential solutions. It is our commitment to not only reflect on the echoes of our 
past but also to address the pressing challenges currently facing our community.
To our valued readers: Your engagement is crucial to us. We encourage you to 
share your thoughts and feedback. By confronting our past in all its complexity, 
we strive to build a more informed and empathetic future together.
Warm regards,
