2019 Whitefly Outbreak: 
In 2019, Sri Lanka's coconut plantations faced 
a significant challenge when the first major 
outbreak of pests was reported, originating 
in the Kegalle District. This event marked a 
critical turning point for the agricultural sector, 
particularly for communities dependent on 
coconut farming.
Scientific analysis pointed to the infestation 
being predominantly caused by whiteflies. 
Researchers and agricultural experts swiftly 
gathered data, confirming that the Kegalle 
District was the epicentre of this outbreak. 
This was evidenced by the drastic reduction 
in coconut yields, which was notably lower 
compared to previous years' data. The stark

contrast in the productivity levels served as a clear indicator of the 
severity of the infestation.
Furthermore, local farmers' eyewitness accounts and 
photographic evidence of the affected coconut palms 
supported these findings. Leaves exhibited classic signs of 
whitefly damage, such as yellowing, wilting, and premature 
dropping. These observations were consistent with the 
patterns typically associated with whitefly infestations, as 
documented in agricultural case studies.
The government and agricultural bodies responded by 
deploying teams to assess the situation and provide assistance. 
Reports from these teams revealed the widespread nature of the 
problem, not just confined to Kegalle but potentially threatening 
neighbouring regions as well.
In addition to local efforts, international agricultural agencies also took 
note of the situation, providing technical support and guidance. Their 
reports further validated the initial assessments and offered insights 
into potential long-term solutions and prevention strategies.
