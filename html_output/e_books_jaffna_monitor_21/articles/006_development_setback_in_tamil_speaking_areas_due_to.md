A 
significant lapse in responsibility by five Tamil MPs 
has resulted in the loss of 25 crore rupees originally 
designated for development projects in Tamil-speaking 
areas. The Jaffna Monitor learned that this substantial 
sum, which was part of a broader financial allocation for 
community improvement, remained unclaimed because 
the MPs failed to submit their project proposals within the 
required timeframe.

The parliamentarians in question, including 
R. Sampanthan and M.A. Sumanthiran from 
the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), C.V. 
Wigneswaran from the Tamil People's National 
Alliance (TPNA), and Selvarajah Kajendren 
and Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam from the 
Tamil National People's Front (TNPF), were 
each allocated five crore rupees. Their failure to 
act in a timely manner by submitting proposals 
has not only halted potential developments 
that could have benefited their districts 
but also highlighted the need for improved 
accountability and project management among 
elected officials. While R. Sampanthan was 
elected from Trincomalee District, the other 
four MPs were elected from the Jaffna District.
This incident directly impacted the intended 
improvements in their regions, stalling 
progress and enhancing the living standards of 
their districts. It underscores the critical need 
for elected representatives to manage their 
roles with greater diligence and adherence to 
deadlines, ensuring that development funds 
are utilized effectively and for the intended 
purposes.
The incident provides a critical governance 
insight: primary accountability for such 
oversights resides with the individual 
Members of Parliament. This scenario acts as 
a stark reminder of the necessity for proactive 
engagement and diligent responsibility in 
parliamentary duties. It calls for a thoughtful 
reassessment and strategic realignment by 
the involved representatives to avert similar 
shortcomings in the future. As the Tamil 
community diligently pursues enhancements 
across various sectors, ensuring the 
accountability of its elected officials is essential, 
serving as a cornerstone for authentic progress 
and community development.
