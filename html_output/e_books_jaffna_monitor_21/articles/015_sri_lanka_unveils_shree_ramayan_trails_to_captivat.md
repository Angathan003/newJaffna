S
ri Lanka has formally launched the Shree 
Ramayan Trails project, an ambitious 
initiative designed to draw millions of Indian 
and international Hindu pilgrims, travellers, 
and tourists. This initiative connects various 
locales mentioned in the epic Ramayana, 
spotlighting nine sacred sites across Sri Lanka, 
from Adam's Bridge in the Mannar Basin to 
Seetha Eliya in Nuwara Eliya, each imbued 
with significant historical and religious 
importance from the ancient Hindu epic.
A collaborative effort between Sri Lanka 
and India, this project mirrors the deep 
cultural bonds between the two nations and 
aims to bolster Sri Lanka's tourism industry 
by offering tailored pilgrimages and travel 
experiences centred around these storied sites. 
The featured locations in the Ramayan Trails

In a compelling public statement, M.A. Sumanthiran, a prominent member 
of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and parliamentarian for Jaffna, has 
made a poignant appeal to Tamil diaspora entrepreneurs. During a video 
interview with a Tamil online media platform, Sumanthiran, a key figure 
in the leadership dynamics of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), 
voiced significant concerns about the encroachment of financial interests 
into politics. He emphatically urged these business leaders to refrain from 
political engagements, highlighting the increasing anxieties about the role of

wealth in shaping political outcomes.
"Please withdraw from Tamil national 
politics," implored Sumanthiran in his 
statement. He emphasized that monetary 
dealings could potentially derail the 
Tamil people's journey toward liberation. 
He expressed that business activities and 
profit-making ventures should operate 
independently of national political 
interests.
During the interview, Sumanthiran 
responded to an incisive inquiry 
regarding whether any diaspora Tamil 
businessmen had broached the topic 
of financial contributions with him or 
his colleague Sritharan during their 
campaign for the leadership of the Tamil 
National Alliance. He described receiving 
an indirect proposal through a third 
party, which suggested that a political 
party was "for sale" and inquired about 
his interest. Sumanthiran emphasized 
that he never had direct contact with the 
businessman behind the message and 
could not reveal their identity.
The interaction highlights the 
complicated relationship between 
politics and business within the Tamil 
community, where significant influence 
is exerted by wealthy expatriates. "This 
is becoming a major issue today," 
Sumanthiran noted, pointing to instances 
in past parliamentary elections where 
external financial influences reportedly 
swayed opinions against him.
He recounted a specific communication 
from an influential figure holding a 
significant international position at the 
time, warning him about the infusion 
of money into politics in the northern 
regions.
Sumanthiran's appeal to the diaspora 
to steer clear of political involvement 
highlights ongoing concerns about 
the impact of financial influence 
on governance and the potential 
complications it could bring to the Tamil 
community's pursuit of fairness and self-
determination. As the Tamil community 
progresses politically, the interaction 
between diaspora wealth and local 
politics continues to be a topic of debate.
To provide a more comprehensive 
understanding of the dynamics at play, 
it is important to recognize that the 
concerns voiced by M.A. Sumanthiran 
about the influence of diaspora money 
in local politics are not confined to 
any single faction within the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA) or Ilankai 
Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK). These 
issues affect various political groups 
within the Tamil community, each 
influenced differently by their diaspora 
connections. For instance, the Tamil 
National People's Front (TNPF) has often 
been criticized for aligning more closely 
with the interests of certain diaspora 
groups, which are seen as surrogates for 
the former Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE). Critics argue that this 
alignment might prioritize the agenda 
of these diaspora groups over the 
immediate needs and aspirations of the 
local Tamil population in Sri Lanka. This 
underscores the complexity of diaspora 
influence across the spectrum of Tamil 
political parties, each of which may be 
swayed by external interests that do not 
always align with local priorities.

R
esearchers from the Centre 
for Cellular and Molecular 
Biology in Hyderabad and the 
University of Colombo have 
revealed significant findings 
in a recent study that shed 
light on the genetic origins of 
the Vedda tribe, Sri Lanka's 
indigenous inhabitants. The 
study, published in the journal 
'Mitochondrion', indicates a 
strong genetic link between the 
Vedda and certain tribal groups 
in India, potentially rewriting 
the narrative of ethnic and 
cultural histories in South Asia.
The collaborative research 
analyzed DNA samples from 
37 Vedda individuals to 
compare their genetic makeup 
with that of various tribal 
populations across India, 
including the Austroasiatic 
Munda-speaking Santhal and 
Juang tribes of Odisha, as well 
as the Dravidian-speaking 
Irula, Paniya, and Pallar tribes 
New Genetic Insights Reveal 
Ancient Connections Between 
Sri Lanka's Vedda 
and Indian Tribes
A Sri Lankan Vedda man
from Karnataka, 
Kerala, and Tamil 
Nadu. The findings 
show that the Vedda 
share a closer genetic 
connection with 
these Indian tribes 
than with Sri Lanka's 
Sinhalese or Tamil 
populations, despite 
centuries of geographic 
coexistence.
Gyaneshwer Chaubey, 
a population 
geneticist at Banaras 
Hindu University 
who supervised the 
study, expressed 
surprise at the results, 
highlighting that "Sri 
Lanka is an amazing 
place where three 
populations, living 
side by side, interacted 
very differently with 
one another." The 
research indicates that 
while the Sinhalese 
and Tamil populations 
have intermingled 
extensively, the Vedda 
have maintained their 
genetic and cultural 
distinctiveness with 
minimal mixing.
The implications of 
these findings are 
profound, suggesting 
that the Vedda's 
ancestors migrated 
from the Indian 
subcontinent around

55,000 years ago, much earlier 
than previously believed. 
This early migration supports 
the theory that modern 
humans moved out of Africa, 
through India, and into Asia, 
establishing one of the earliest 
known human settlements.
Anjana Welikala, a scientist at 
Colombo University and the 
study's first author pointed 
out the significance of these 
findings in understanding 
the unique demographic 
history of the Vedda. "The 
Vedda have long intrigued 
anthropologists, historians, 
and scientists because of their 
distinct language and culture. 
Our study unravels their 
genetic origins and affinities 
with Indian populations, 
emphasizing their role as 
direct descendants of the 
island's earliest inhabitants," 
Welikala explained.
The study also highlights the 
Vedda's linguistic uniqueness, 
with their language being 
one of the three linguistically 
isolated languages on the 
subcontinent. This linguistic 
evidence, combined with 
genetic data, underscores 
the Vedda's long history 
of isolation and cultural 
preservation.
The scientific community has 
greeted the latest research 
with enthusiasm, as it 
provides fresh perspectives on 
the settlement of the Indian 
subcontinent and the intricate 
patterns of human migration. 
Additionally, this work 
prompts crucial discussions 
about the preservation 
of indigenous cultures in 
the context of increasing 
globalization. As Sri Lanka 
and India further explore their 
shared prehistoric heritage, 
the history of the Vedda 
people highlights the rich and 
varied narratives that inform 
our contemporary existence.
