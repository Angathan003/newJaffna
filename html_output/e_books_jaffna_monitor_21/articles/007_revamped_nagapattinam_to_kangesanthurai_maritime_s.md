T
he long-awaited revival of the 
Nagapattinam to Kangesanthurai ship 
service, set to commence operations on May 
13th, is poised to usher in a renewed era of 
connectivity and cultural exchange across 
the Tamil regions, Jaffna Monitor learns. 
According to reliable sources, this initiative 
is ready to make waves with the newly 
refurbished 'Sivagangai' vessel at the forefront, 
overcoming numerous delays that have 
historically plagued its launch.
Crafted to foster cultural ties and offer 
economical travel options, the service is 
strategically designed to serve as a vital 
maritime link. Scheduled to run daily, it 
promises to enhance commercial exchange 
and tourism, connecting these regions rich 
in historical significance. Each journey from 
Nagai to Kangesanthurai will offer a swift 
four-hour passage, with return voyages 
scheduled on the same day to maximize both 
convenience and operational efficiency.
The pricing strategy is notably inclusive 
and aimed at broadening accessibility to the 
service. Based on the prevailing exchange 
rates, a round-trip fare is set at 114 US dollars, 
equivalent to roughly 34,000 Sri Lankan 
rupees. This pricing model is intended to 
attract a wider audience, encouraging an 
appreciation for the distinct beauty and 
heritage of the connected regions.
In addition to the launch's importance, sources 
indicate that President Ranil Wickremesinghe 
is expected to attend the inaugural journey. As 
the service sails through the waters of the Gulf 
of Mannar, it links geographic locations and 
seeks to strengthen the bonds among diverse 
communities, fostering a sense of unity.
