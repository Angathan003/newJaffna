The most satisfying moment in my militant 
career
 In the wake of the burning of the library and the subsequent 
destruction of downtown Jaffna in 1981, tensions escalated 
rapidly. People reported seeing several buses loaded with 
Buddhist monks arriving at the Naga Vihara on Stanley 
Road in Jaffna. Rumours spread quickly that the monks 
were also involved in the burning of the library. 
On the same day, I accidentally visited a secret LTTE meeting 
house; my visit was unplanned. In the house, prominent 
members, including Rasupillai, Seelan, and Mahathaya, were 
preparing for a retaliatory attack on the Buddhist monks at 
Naga Vihara Temple. They planned to kill as many Buddhist 
monks as they could. They mistakenly believed that the 
monks had participated in the burning of the library. 
I realized the gravity and foolishness of the plan and 
became convinced that, had this attack been carried out, 
it would have irreparably harmed the legitimacy of the 
Tamil liberation movement. Feeling nervous and tense, I 
knew I couldn't stop the planned attack alone. However,

KT Sivakumar, also known as 
Anton Master, is a prominent 
early member of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and a close associate of leader 
Prabhakaran. He significantly 
contributed to the LTTE 
as a member of its Central 
Committee and as the founder 
and head of the Military Office 
(MO), enhancing the group's 
military effectiveness. Known 
for his reticence in media 
interactions, Sivakumar prefers 
'dialogues' over interviews. 
The following is a part of a 
series of dialogues I had with 
him, providing rare insights, 
which will be featured in the 
forthcoming issues.

Prabhakaran could. I urged them not 
to take any action until I returned from 
meeting with Prabhakaran. 
I rushed to see Prabhakaran, who was 
lying ill in one of my safe rooms. I 
explained the consequences of such 
actions to him, emphasizing that an 
attack would tarnish the reputation of 
our movement and irreversibly brand 
us as terrorists beyond redemption. 
I stressed that if this reckless attack 
happened, it would immediately end 
our struggle for freedom. 
Prabhakaran agreed with my arguments, 
and I obtained a written order to halt 
the attack. With this letter in hand, 
I returned to them and stopped the 
planned attack. I believe this decision 
was crucial in preventing the LTTE from 
being labelled a terrorist organization at

vandalism, the library was burned down by Sinhala mobs, allegedly 
with the tacit approval of the then ruling UNP government and its 
ministers.

that early stage internationally. 
I prefer not to dwell on my militant days, as they 
bring me immense agony. However, reflecting 
on this incident, I realize there's a hint of 
satisfaction in knowing I prevented a massacre. 
It's comforting to realize that my actions helped 
avert a great calamity that could have befallen 
the Sri Lankan Tamil community. 
What is your opinion about Karuna 
Amman, who was the Eastern 
Commander of the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE)?
I saw Karuna only as Prabhakaran's bodyguard. 
If you are selected in Prabhakaran's bodyguard 
unit, chances are high that you will be promoted 
to the ranks of the LTTE. Looking back at the 
LTTE, it is clear that Prabhakaran prioritized 
loyalty over talent and merit. This is an everyday 
reality for anyone leading an organization in an 
authoritarian way. They have to protect their 
backs, and Prabhakaran is no exception.
Whenever I met Karuna in the 1980s, he would 
address me as 'Anton Anna,' If I am correct, 
Karuna was a third-batch trainee in Salem 
camp. At that time, I did not perceive him as 
particularly talented.
As for his revolt against LTTE leadership, his 
motives behind it, and the politics and rivalry 
between him and other LTTE leaders, I have 
no knowledge of what happened. Since I left/
fired the LTTE, I have never looked back. I only 
see events here and there on social media or 
whenever people approach me.
What is your view on Rajiv Gandhi's 
murder?
I was not in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. I 
left a few years ago, in 1988. In my opinion, the 
killing was a big mistake and shameful.
Internationally, this massacre and other alleged 
terrorist activities by the LTTE became the 
primary reasons for the LTTE to be considered 
a terrorist organization. The killing of Tamil 
United 
Liberation 
Front 
(TULF) 
leader 
Amirthalingam was also a significant error and 
unforgivable. An organization like the LTTE, 
which was an ethnic liberation movement, 
should never have indulged in such crimes.
I believe the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was 
an act of revenge orchestrated by Prabhakaran.

Prabhakaran was foolish to think that after 
assassinating a former Prime Minister of 
a nation like India, other countries would 
continue to support him. Such massacres, along 
with other senseless killings and misconduct by 
the LTTE, contributed to the transformation of 
the LTTE from a movement of freedom fighters 
to a widely condemned terrorist group. 
By committing these murders, Prabhakaran not 
only diminished his status as a freedom fighter 
but also portrayed himself as a terrorist to 
the world. Similarly, the LTTE's image shifted 
from that of freedom fighters to a dreaded 
terrorist organization. Ultimately, it was the 
innocent LTTE fighters who paid the price for 
Prabhakaran's folly.
Receiving arms from Premadasa's 
government
The LTTE's decision to receive arms from the 
then President of Sri Lanka, Premadasa, to fight 
against India – which had come to the aid of 
the Sri Lankan Tamil people – was profoundly 
misguided and unforgivable.
It's entirely indefensible for the Tigers, having 
engaged with the Sri Lankan government for 
their own survival and self-interest, then to 
accuse other liberation movements of being 
quislings for similar collaborations. If one were 
to adhere to this logic of labelling, then the 
LTTE and Prabhakaran should be deemed the 
foremost traitors for colluding with Premadasa's 
government. However, I don't subscribe to this 
simplistic labelling.
The inconsistency in the Tigers' stance is stark: 
they received substantial funds and arms from 
Premadasa to wage war against the Indian 
government, yet they vehemently criticized 
and killed leaders and members of other 
movements for forming alliances with the 
Sri Lankan government, denouncing them as 
traitors. This approach is fundamentally flawed 
and epitomizes a double standard.
What was your state of mind when 
Prabhakaran died in 2009?
I had been anticipating this downfall since 
1988. It became clear to me back then that 
Prabhakaran, through his foolishness, would 
ultimately destroy himself and the LTTE. This 
was apparent to me when Prabhakaran rejected 
the interim government proposed by the Indian 
government and chose to wage war against it in 
1988. However, I did not know when or where 
their end would come.
Therefore, when Prabhakaran died, and the 
LTTE was completely destroyed in 2009, I 
did not experience any particular emotion. 
However, the fact that Prabhakaran, through his 
recklessness, caused the deaths of thousands of 
innocent lives, including his own, is something 
that deeply saddens me.
He did not have the foresight to realize that 
there is no such straight-line road to Tamil 
Eelam, federalism, whatever. This would not 
have happened if he had known that there are 
many steps and paths to overcome during the 
process of achieving a freedom struggle.
Now, I see many moderate Tamil parties/
leaders making the same mistakes. Their empty 
sentimental slogans and cinematic heroic 
populist speeches do not achieve anything. 
They do not want to use the 13th Amendment 
as a stepping stone. However, the same people 
fight tooth and nail with others for less powerful 
provincial councils who are still rejecting the 
13th Amendment. This is a funny joke.
