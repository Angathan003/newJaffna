en years ago, on the night of April 6th, Sri Lanka rejoiced 
like it had never done before. It was a night where, against 
all odds, Sri Lanka overcame India to win an elusive ICC title 
after numerous attempts. It would be unfair to consider it 
payback for that painful, dewy night in Mumbai in 2011, as the 
Limited Overs World Cup remains the king of all crowns. Yet, 
for a nation starved for ultimate recognition despite remarkable 
consistency in the shortest format, it was the ultimate high.
It was a kind of redemption for Sri Lanka in many ways. But this 
story isn't about Sri Lanka; it's about two men. You may think,

"Yes, we have heard it before—the last four 
overs, isn't it?" Yes, partially, but mostly no. It's 
about a redemption arc that went unnoticed 
amidst the unconventional heist those two 
men pulled off against the Bradmanesque 
Kohli, Dhoni, and Yuvraj—who are no lesser 
mortals by any means.
Yes, it's about Kulasekara and Malinga, but 
not what happened that night. On a similar, 
perhaps even bigger, night in October 2012, 
all roads led to R Premadasa Stadium. 
Having beaten a strong Pakistan team, Sri 
Lanka began the match with almost one 
hand on the coveted, elusive title. By halfway 
through the first innings, it seemed like only 
a mere formality remained before Sri Lanka 
would erupt into roars of supremacy. In the 
meantime, a struggling Samuels hit a flat ball, 
which slipped out of Kulasekara's reliable 
hands. It sounded a bell because a similar drop 
had hurt Sri Lanka the year before.

One thought a repeat wasn't 
possible that night. But 
somehow, Marlon acted as if he 
had an account to settle with 
Malinga. It was an onslaught 
of intense aggression. Samuels 
tamed the beast in Malinga 
that night. Malinga was 
massacred. As Sri Lanka went 
to bed that night, hoping and 
praying what had unfolded 
was just a nightmarish dream, 
those two men would have 
known it came down to them. 
Nobody would point that out 
to Kulasekara, who was the 
most likeable, or Malinga, who has seen worse 
and proved himself over the years, but surely 
they might have wondered whether they would 
ever have a shot at glorious redemption, which 
both they and the team deserved.
Ten years ago, on that night in Mirpur, it had 
literally come down to them. Kohli was in 
a phase where it seemed he could dictate to 
the ball where he wanted it to go. Dhoni was 
Dhoni—unflappable, as always. Though out 
of touch, Yuvraj could never be dismissed as a 
potential game-changer. If Marlon could turn 
the tide, Yuvraj certainlyYuvraj certainly would 
not be considered a spent force. Sri Lanka 
had performed well, but all that could have 
dissipated into thin air had the deathovers 
proceeded according to Kohli and Dhoni's 
prerogative.
In addition, Malinga grasped Kohli early on. It 
was now or never in every possible way for the 
duo and Sri Lanka.
What followed was unconventional brilliance 
and out-of-the-box thinking orchestrated by 
audacity. The pinpoint precision with which 
the play was executed warrants it a place in the 
history books, and to date, the cricket world 
has rightly recognized it. But it was those two 
very men, who would have hit the pillow a few 
months earlier with heavy hearts and heavier 
heads, who orchestrated their own and the 
team's rightful redemption on a misty night 
against all odds.
That misty night in Mirpur was surely a crest 
in the chests of the whole squad. But for those 
two men, Kulasekara and Malinga, it was 
more than recognition. It was a validation of 
character and a living reminder that life will 
not remember you for how badly you fell, but 
for how strongly you rose again.
Kulasekara and Malinga will be remembered 
just for that on that mystical, misty night in 
Mirpur, which makes Sri Lanka smile even 
today.
They fell at Maligawatte and rose back in style 
in Mirpur. That's the magic of resilience.
