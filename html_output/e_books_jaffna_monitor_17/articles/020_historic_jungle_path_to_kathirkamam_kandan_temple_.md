groups of pilgrims on their spiritual 
journey. Many devotees also choose to 
undertake this pilgrimage individually, 
driven by personal faith and the serene 
call of the jungle path.
"Kataragama" is synonymous with belief, 
faith, and devotion. It is a place where 
devotees from all corners of Sri Lanka, 
irrespective of pride or prejudice, come 
to ask Kataragama Deviyo, the Hindu war 
god Murugan, for favors, often bound by 
a promise to be repaid. During the peak 
season, hundreds of devotees pack all 
corners of the temple grounds, bearing 
offerings of fruit baskets laden with fruits. 
The sound of coconuts crashing to the 
ground and devotees chanting prayers 
is a common sight, with some extreme 
devotees putting their bodies through 
mortal pain, driven by the notion of 
immortal satisfaction from the gods.
A significant highlight of this devotion 
is the annual foot pilgrimage made by

devotees from hundreds of kilometers away, 
converging on the temple grounds after a 
quick wash in the river bordering the sacred 
grounds. Ordinary people who feel they have 
received a 'call' take part in this marathon 
walk, leaving behind everything but a bundle 
of essentials, experiencing the life of a poor or 
religious recluse.
The pilgrimage offers profound lessons about 
the paradoxes of life through a sustained act of 
self-denial.
Every year, a notable number of devotees 
from the Selva Sannidhi Murugan Temple 
in Thondaimanaru, Jaffna, undertake a 
long pilgrimage walk. This journey spans 
approximately 48 days and covers 815 
kilometers, passing through the Northern, 
Eastern, and Uva provinces and the districts of 
Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, 
Batticaloa, Ampara, and Monaragala. This 
pilgrimage is considered the longest holy 
journey in Sri Lanka, during which devotees 
visit hundreds of temples.
The devotees from Selva Sannidhi Murugan 
Temple join those at the Ukanthai Murugan 
Temple to continue their journey along the 
forest path. Among them is Murugenthiram, 
a 70-year-old regular Yatra participant, who 
shared with the Jaffna Monitor that this is his 
15th time undertaking the pilgrimage. He 
emphasized the significance of the pilgrimage 
in Hindu beliefs, stating that undertaking a 
long Yatra at least once a year helps align the 
body and mind. Murugenthiram explained 
that his life changed dramatically after he 
started going on Yatras, as he now harbors only 
positive thoughts. Given the uncertainties that 
may arise, he elaborated that a tremendous 
amount of positive thinking is required for 
such a long journey.
"Whether it rains or not, you won't complain. 
Rather, you will see it as God's gift," he 
said. "Eventually, this mindset shifts your 
perspective entirely. You start seeing only 
positive things and generating positive 
thoughts, not just during the Yatra but also in 
everyday life," he concluded.
