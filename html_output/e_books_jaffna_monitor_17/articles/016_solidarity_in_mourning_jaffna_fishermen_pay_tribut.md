Solidarity in Mourning: 
Jaffna Fishermen Pay Tribute 
to Fallen Sinhala Navy Hero
I
n a tragic incident off the coast of 
Kankasanthurai, Jaffna, Senior Sailor 
Priyantha Rathnayake (41) of the Navy Special 
Boat Squadron lost his life during a special 
operation aimed at apprehending a group 
of Indian fishermen. The mission sought to 
intercept an Indian bottom trawler engaged 
in illegal fishing activities within Sri Lankan 
waters. During the operation, the aggressive 
maneuvers of the Indian trawler resulted in 
critical injuries to Rathnayake. Despite being 
swiftly transported to the Teaching Hospital 
in Jaffna, he unfortunately succumbed to his 
injuries.
Following the incident, a post-mortem 
examination conducted by the Jaffna 
Magistrate determined that the sailor's death 
resulted from spinal cord damage. The seized 
Indian trawler and the ten fishermen on board 
were brought to the Kankesanthurai Harbour. 
The fishermen face charges of illegal fishing, 
causing the death of naval personnel, and 
damaging naval property.

Senior Sailor Priyantha Rathnayake 
was laid to rest in a solemn 
ceremony with full naval honors 
in Hippawwa, Ibbagamuwa. In 
a poignant display of solidarity, 
the Jaffna fishermen community 
made the journey to Kurunegala to 
pay their respects. One fisherman 
shared with the Jaffna Monitor, 
"He, a Sinhala Navy sailor, died for 
Tamil fishermen." Their presence 
and words underscored the deep 
respect and gratitude they felt. 
The Jaffna fishermen called on the 
Sri Lankan government and the 
Fisheries Minister to take decisive 
action against the persistent issue 
of Indian trawlers encroaching on 
their fishing grounds, damaging 
the seabed, and depleting fishing 
reserves. Fisheries Minister 
Douglas Devananda, in a poignant 
tribute, carried the coffin on his 
shoulders. Rathnayake, a father to 
a 6-year-old son and an 11-year-
old daughter, was posthumously 
promoted to the rank of Fleet Chief 
Petty Officer by the Commander of 
the Navy.
In recent years, North-East fishermen have voiced their 
concerns about Indian trawlers using larger boats, which 
damage the seabed and carry larger catches, making it 
harder for Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen to obtain a catch. 
In March 2022, Eelam Tamil fishermen wrote to Tamil 
Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin, seeking a progressive 
solution for the two Tamil fisherman communities on 
either side of the Palk Strait.
The illegal and encroaching fishing activities within 
Sri Lankan maritime waters, evidently orchestrated by 
the Tamil Nadu fishing mafia, are primarily aimed at 
exploiting marine resources. These bottom trawlers, 
employed by the mafia, are depleting the resources 
available to northern Sri Lankan fishermen and causing 
significant and often irreversible harm to the aquatic

environment. The extensive damage inflicted 
on the seabed by these trawlers disrupts 
marine ecosystems, leading to a decline in fish 
populations and other marine life, thereby 
threatening the livelihood of local fishermen.
Furthermore, this illicit fishing activity is 
exacerbating tensions between Sri Lankan 
Tamil and Indian Tamil fishermen. The 
encroachment creates economic hardships and 
fosters distrust and conflict between the two 
communities.
Credible sources from Tamil Nadu indicate 
that Tamil Nadu politicians are directly 
involved in these activities, with many 
boat owners being political leaders from 
various main parties. Notably, a former 
central minister from the DMK is among 
the owners. These politicians' complicity 
and direct participation provide support and 
protection to the fishing mafia, enabling the 
continuation of these destructive practices. 
The ramifications of such illegal operations 
extend beyond environmental degradation, 
undermining regional stability and inter-
community relations.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has 
also written to Union Minister for External 
Affairs S. Jaishankar, requesting the convening 
of the Joint Working Group to secure the 
release of all the fishermen and their fishing 
boats from Sri Lankan custody. Indian 
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar assured 
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin of 
efforts to secure the release of 34 Indian 
fishermen from the southern state who have 
been in Sri Lanka's custody. Jaishankar said 
the Indian High Commission in Colombo 
and the Indian Consulate in Jaffna have been 
expeditiously and consistently taking up such 
cases for the early release of those detained.
