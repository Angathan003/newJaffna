ikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has finally returned 
to his homeland, Australia, after a U.S. judge approved 
an unexpected plea deal. "Julian Assange is free," WikiLeaks 
announced in a statement on X. "He left Belmarsh maximum 
security prison [in the U.K.] on the morning of June 24, 
after having spent 1901 days there." The co-founder of the 
whistleblowing website has agreed to plead guilty to one count

of conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified 
U.S. national defense documents, thus 
concluding his prolonged legal struggle against 
extradition to the United States. This marks 
the first time in 12 years that Assange is free. 
The decision, announced early Wednesday 
morning, has led to celebrations among his 
supporters worldwide.
Homecoming in Canberra
Assange landed at Canberra Airport in the 
Australian capital, where he was greeted 
by a cheering crowd of supporters. As he 
disembarked the aircraft, he waved to the 
crowd and shared an emotional reunion with 
his wife, Stella. The couple embraced on the 
tarmac, visibly moved by the moment.
"Julian wanted me to sincerely thank 
everyone," Stella said at a press conference. "He 
wanted to be here. But you have to understand 
what he's been through. He needs time, he 
needs to recuperate, and this is a process." 
With tears in her eyes, she requested privacy 
for their family as they adjust to their new life 
together.
The Plea Deal and Legal Proceedings
After formalizing his plea deal earlier that 
day, Assange walked out of a courtroom in 
Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, a remote 
U.S. Pacific territory. He pleaded guilty to one 
count of conspiracy to unlawfully obtain and 
disclose classified information. "I am, in fact, 
guilty of the charge," Assange told the court.
Assange's U.S. lawyer, Barry Pollack, 
highlighted the unprecedented nature of the 
case under the Espionage Act, emphasizing 
that Assange had revealed truthful, 
newsworthy information. "The prosecution 
of Julian Assange is unprecedented in the 
100 years of the Espionage Act," Pollack said. 
"Mr. Assange revealed truthful, newsworthy 
information ... We firmly believe that Mr. 
Assange never should have been charged 
under the Espionage Act."
A Decade-Long Pursuit
Assange's release from London's high-security 
Belmarsh prison on Monday was pivotal in 
a legal saga that spanned over a decade. His 
arrest in 2019 came after Ecuador withdrew 
his asylum, ending his seven-year stay at the 
Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Since then, he 
has faced numerous legal challenges, including 
an extradition order signed by the U.K. Home 
Secretary in 2022, which he successfully 
appealed on mental health grounds.
In a surprising move, Assange was flown to 
the Northern Mariana Islands for the court 
proceedings, avoiding the continental U.S. 
due to his deep mistrust of the country. 
This location was chosen for its logistical 
convenience, being closer to Australia.
The Evolution of WikiLeaks: From 
Inception to Global Impact
WikiLeaks was established in 2006 by Julian 
Assange, who registered the domain name 
and set the foundation for what would 
become a groundbreaking platform. Initially 
designed as a disclosure portal modeled after 
Wikipedia, WikiLeaks allowed anonymous 
submissions that were edited by volunteers. 
However, it quickly evolved into a repository 
for anonymously sourced material, where 
news and classified information could be 
uploaded using the anonymity software Tor. 
This software ensured the uploader's identity 
remained protected from network surveillance, 
including WikiLeaks.

One of WikiLeaks' earliest and most significant 
revelations concerned the U.S. government's 
practices at the Guantanamo Bay detention 
camp, which violated Geneva Convention 
protocols. It was the period when the site's 
anonymized submission system was fully 
operational that saw some of the most 
consequential leaks.
Among these were millions of classified 
files from the U.S. Department of Defense 
concerning the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 
as well as numerous State Department 
communiques. These documents were released 
by former U.S. soldier Chelsea (then Bradley) 
Manning.
A pivotal moment came on April 5, 2010, 
when WikiLeaks released a 39-minute video 
showing gun-sight footage from two U.S. AH-
64 Apache helicopters during a 2007 incident 
in Iraq. The video depicted the helicopter crew 
firing indiscriminately, killing civilians and 
two Reuters war correspondents. Reuters had 
unsuccessfully sought access to this video for 
nearly three years through the U.S. Freedom of 
Information Act.
Impact and Legacy
The release of the war logs, published by a 
consortium of media organizations, exposed 
human rights abuses by occupation forces 
and highlighted the increased fatality counts 
in Iraq. These leaks provided significant 
public insight into the operations, lifestyles, 
and attitudes of elites in various countries, 
dramatically influencing global perceptions 
and discussions.
WikiLeaks' innovative use of cryptographic 
tools to safeguard sources and enable 
anonymous leaks of sensitive information has 
revolutionized investigative journalism. By 
exposing the inner workings of governments 
and power structures, WikiLeaks has 
significantly impacted the field of journalism, 
advancing the global pursuit of transparency 
and accountability.
Returning Home
Australian officials, including Ambassador to 
Washington Kevin Rudd and Prime Minister 
Anthony Albanese, played crucial roles in 
negotiating Assange's return. Upon his arrival, 
Albanese expressed his satisfaction with the 
outcome, highlighting the diplomatic efforts 
involved.
Assange's homecoming, however, comes with a 
significant financial burden. He owes $520,000 
for the charter flight back to Australia. To 
cover these expenses and support his recovery, 
an international campaign has been launched, 
appealing for donations from his supporters.
Future Prospects
As Julian Assange begins his new life in 
Australia, the impact of his work with 
WikiLeaks continues to resonate globally. His 
case has set a precedent for the protection of 
journalistic freedom and the role of the media 
in holding power to account. While WikiLeaks 
is now a shadow of its former self, its legacy 
of transparency and whistleblowing remains 
influential.
