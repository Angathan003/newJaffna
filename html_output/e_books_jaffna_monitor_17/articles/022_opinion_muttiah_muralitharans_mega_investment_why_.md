Muttiah Muralitharan's 
Mega Investment: 
Why Not in Sri Lanka?

n a surprising move, Sri Lankan cricket 
legend Muttiah Muralitharan has chosen 
to invest an astounding â‚¹1,400 crore INR 
(approximately 5105.12 crore SLR) in 
Karnataka, India, rather than in his homeland, 
Sri Lanka.
The ambitious project, named "Muttiah 
Beverages and Confectioneries," aims to 
establish a state-of-the-art beverage and 
confectionery manufacturing facility in 
Badanakuppe, Chamarajanagara district, 
Karnataka, with plans for further expansion in 
Dharwad.
Karnataka's Minister for Large and Medium 
Industries, M.B. Patil, announced this major 
investment following detailed discussions with 
Muttiah Muralitharan. The manufacturing 
unit, which will span 46 acres, is slated to 
commence operations by January 2025. This 
marks a significant milestone in Muralitharan's 
post-cricket entrepreneurial journey, 
transitioning from a legendary spinner to a 
strategic business magnate.
Minister M.B. Patil expressed optimism about 
the project, noting the allocation of 46 acres 
and the resolution of minor land issues to 
facilitate the venture. He highlighted that this 
investment would bring significant economic 
benefits to the region and create numerous 
job opportunities, further strengthening 
Karnataka's industrial landscape.

Lanka?

made his recent decision to invest significant 
money abroad a topic of great curiosity and 
speculation. Some suggest that Sri Lanka's 
recent economic crisis might have influenced 
his decision. Additionally, the challenges 
faced by an Indian company's windmill 
project in Mannar, valued at approximately 
LKR 40,000 crore, might have served as a 
cautionary tale.
This project encountered numerous obstacles 
from local politicians, civil societies, and 
vested interests. In their eagerness to belittle 
the project, some politicians seemed to 
forget the sustainability and environmental 
friendliness of windmills, not to mention the 
potential reduction in electricity bills. 
One Tamil politician, opposing the project for 
reasons known only to him, even claimed that 
the noise from the windmills would disrupt 
students' studies. Muralitharan, keen to avoid 
similar hindrances, may perceive India as a 
more welcoming and supportive environment 
for his business ventures.
Sri Lanka's loss is palpable, as the country has 
missed a major investment that could have 
spurred economic growth and development. 
Muralitharan's decision underscores the 
broader issue of investor confidence in Sri 
Lanka, highlighting the need for a more stable 
and transparent business environment.
The recent economic turmoil in Sri Lanka 
has significantly influenced the decisions 
of prominent investors like Muttiah 
Muralitharan. His choice to invest abroad 
exemplifies a broader trend of investors wary 
of Sri Lanka's complexities and uncertainties. 
Muralitharan's decision underscores the 
urgent need for Sri Lanka to address its 
economic and political challenges, as well as 
the tendency of some individuals to oppose 
progress. 
This decision reflects the country's 
challenging investment climate and 
represents a significant loss for Sri Lanka, 
both financially and in terms of missed 
opportunities for economic growth and 
international appeal. By opting to invest in 
India, Muralitharan highlights the necessity 
for reforms to attract and retain substantial 
investments in the future.
