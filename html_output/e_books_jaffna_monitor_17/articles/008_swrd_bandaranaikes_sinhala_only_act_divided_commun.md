In this exclusive interview with the Jaffna 
Monitor, Professor Gunaratna discusses Sri 
Lanka’s transition into confronting new forms 
of threats that affect every citizen, and he out-
lines practical steps needed to enhance safety 
and security.
Based on your latest research into 
'Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday Massacre: 
Lessons for the International 
Community,' what are the primary 
motivations driving young Sri Lankan 
Muslims towards radicalization and 
joining groups like the Islamic State?
A tiny percentage of Sri Lankan Muslims 
are attracted by the narratives of al-Qaeda, 
the Islamic State, and like-minded groups. 
They were politicised and radicalised into 
embracing an ideology of separation from the 
larger Muslim community. During this period, 
two anti-Muslim ideologies—ultra-Tamil 
nationalism and Sinhala Buddhist exclusivism 
and extremism—also emerged. In two phases, 
the love and loyalty of a tiny percentage of Sri 
Lankan Muslims diminished. They became 
vulnerable and susceptible to embracing 
extremist and violent ideologies.
Phase One: It all started after Sri Lanka 
became an open economy in 1977. Sufism, 
a beautiful form of Islam, was gradually 
replaced. Sri Lankan Muslims that travelled 
to the Gulf countries and to Pakistan brought 
exclusivist foreign ideologies that transformed 
the Sri Lankan Muslim landscape. They 
started to dress like Arabs and Pakistanis, and 
a few hundred attacked local and traditional 
Muslims, notably in Kathankudi.
Over a decade preceding the Easter attack, 
Jamaat-e-Islami, Salafi Wahhabism, and 
other foreign ideologies created a wedge 
between the Muslims from the non-Muslims. 
A tiny percentage of Muslims, especially in 
the Eastern Province, were indoctrinated 
to oppose local and traditional Islam that 
forms a part of Sri Lankan Muslim heritage. 
With religious radicalisation, they rejected 
and replaced the Sri Lankan Muslim heritage 
largely characterised by Sufism with their 
brand of Islam. A new social and cultural 
milieu prepared the ground to embrace vicious 
ideologies that would hurt and harm the 
larger Muslim community and then the non-
Muslims.   
Phase Two: With deepening religious 
radicalisation, a small percentage of Muslims 
started to believe that al-Qaeda, the Islamic 
State, and similar groups are Islamic 
movements promoting puritanical Islam. 
According to the Islamic State, about 1,500 
Muslims were influenced and indoctrinated by 
these foreign ideologies. They joined the rank 
and file of the Islamic State.
Jamaat-e-Islami student wing national 
organiser Sadiq Abdul Haq travelled to Iraq 
and trained with an al Qaeda associate group. 
After returning, he joined the Islamic State 
together with his brother Sadiq Abdul Haq,

and their followers attacked the 
Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian 
images. With two dozen followers 
and family members, Nilam, who 
married into a Salafi Wahhabi 
family, travelled to Iraq and 
Syria and died fighting. Nilam's 
father-in-law founded All Ceylon 
Tawheed Jamaat, another Salafi 
Wahhabi group that is still 
functioning in Colombo.
Not a single Sri Lankan Sufi joined 
either al-Qaeda or the Islamic 
State. Operating both physically 
and virtually, these groups recruit 
Muslims radicalised by these 
foreign ideologies that have now 
taken root in Sri Lanka.
How are these radical 
groups still successfully 
recruiting members within 
Sri Lanka despite increased 
scrutiny and counter-
terrorism efforts?
Sri Lankan security forces have 
developed competencies to fight 
terrorism at the operational and 
tactical levels. When confronted 
with religious exclusivism and 
extremism, the threat must be 
addressed at a strategic level. This 
means dismantling the ideologies 
by reviewing what the clerics 
preach, scrutinising the syllabi of 
the madrasahs, and monitoring 
the online platforms that radicalise 
Muslims to hate non-Muslims and 
vis-a-versa.
To address the threat at a strategic 
level, the Government should build a partnership with 
Muslim political, religious, and community leaders. 
Religious violence and terrorism stem from the 
indoctrination of the community. As such, to protect 
the religious space, mainstream Muslim elders, elites, 
clerics, and leaders have a much bigger role to play than 
government security forces.
Without subscribing to conspiracy theories, Muslim 
leaders should do the following:  First, implement the 
recommendations of the Presidential Commission of 
Inquiry into the Easter Sunday attacks. Second, identify, 
select, and train the best and the brightest clerics from All 
Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) to visit the terrorists 
in custody and the extremists released on bail and start 
to mainstream their deviant thinking. Third, community 
engagement programs should be established to build 
and enhance relations between Mosques, churches, 
Buddhist temples, and kovils. Fourth, engage far-reaching 
Muslim religious leaders to protect their religious 
space, a precious treasure, by reintroducing local and 
traditional religion. Fifth, build Harmony Committee 
in every province, Harmony centres in every district, 
and harmony clubs in every University and school to

promote intercultural relations. Sixth, create 
a dedicated Joint Information Warfare Centre 
to monitor and rebut the radical and violent 
ideologies coming from the misinterpretation 
of all faiths radicalising Sri Lankans. Seventh, 
build a Presidential Council of Religious 
leaders to promote moderation, tolerance, and 
coexistence within their communities.
In your opinion, has the Sri Lankan 
government effectively addressed 
the root causes of radicalisation? 
What gaps do you see in their current 
strategy?
The first step to preventing and counter-
radicalisation is understanding the changing 
regional and global threats.
Before the introduction of virulent foreign 
ideologies, Sri Lankan Islam was described as 
idyllic. Sri Lankan Islam coexisted with all the 
other communities until foreign ideologies 
with funds from the Gulf established a 
footprint in Sri Lanka. This has happened 
not only in Sri Lanka but in many countries. 
Instead of being an exception, Sri Lanka 
should address the ongoing drift away from Sri 
Lankan Islam.
There is a protocol to prevent and counter the 
radicalisation of Muslims. To curb violence 
and terrorism, the most intelligent approach 
is not to act after an attack happens. It is to 
prevent the radicalisation of innocent Muslims 
into exclusivism, extremism, violence, and 
terrorism. The strategy is to build social 
cohesion between Muslims and non-Muslims. 
The gap has widened between Muslims and 
non-Muslims after the introduction of Jamaat-
e-Islami, Salafi Wahhabi, and other foreign 
ideologies.
A relative of an Easter attack victim mourns during the funeral. The Easter Sunday attacks on April 21, 2019, were a series of 
coordinated bombings targeting churches and hotels across Sri Lanka, resulting in the tragic loss of over 270 lives and injuring 
more than 500 people.
