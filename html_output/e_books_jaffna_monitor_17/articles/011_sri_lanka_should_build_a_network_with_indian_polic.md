You have mentioned the need 
for community engagement and 
rehabilitation programs. What specific 
steps should Muslim community 
leaders take to combat radicalisation 
within their communities?
After the Easter Sunday attack on April 
21, 2019, the rehabilitation program was 
disrupted by Muslim organizations filing cases 
against the rehabilitation of extremists. This 
should first be addressed by explaining what 
rehabilitation is and why it is necessary to 
mitigate recidivism, regeneration, and terrorist 
iconography. The methods of rehabilitation, 
developed and designed to reform the 
beneficiaries, should be conducted by Muslim 
bodies in partnership with the Sri Lankan 
government.
1.	Religious and spiritual rehabilitation,
2.	Educational rehabilitation,
3.	Vocational and entrepreneurial 
rehabilitation,
4.	Social, cultural, and family rehabilitation,
5.	Creative and performance arts in 
rehabilitation,
6.	Sports and recreational rehabilitation,
7.	Psychological rehabilitation,
8.	Financial rehabilitation
To build an effective rehabilitation program, 
each inmate should be assessed, categorised, 
engaged, and, transformed. In parallel, there 
should be a community engagement program 
in the physical and virtual space to address 
radicalisation. The approach is to detect and 
disrupt the cycle of suspicion, prejudice, 
resentment, hatred, anger, violence, and 
terrorism. In this regard, leaders of Buddhist, 
Hindu, and Christian communities should 
work closely with Muslim leaders to resolve 
any misunderstandings or disputes that can 
lead to hatred and violence.
Similarly, clerics, madrasahs, and mosques that 
radicalized Muslims to join the Islamic State 
group that staged the Easter Sunday attack 
should be identified and reformed. Muslim 
leaders should exercise leadership to secure the 
Muslim religious space by constantly alerting 
its community members to be vigilant of 
infiltration.
Why do you think there has been 
resistance or reluctance from some 
Muslim leaders to acknowledge and 
address the issue of radicalization?
After the Easter Sunday attack, both the Sri 
Lankan government and Muslim leaders 
"Sri Lanka should build a network with Indian police 
intelligence and counter-terrorism units, including 
Tamil Nadu's Q Branch and Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism 
Squad, to combat the Islamic State threat."

should have taken the threat of Muslim 
radicalisation seriously. The Government 
and community should have built a sustained 
partnership and addressed the threat at a 
national and community level. To build a safe 
and secure community for all, the Government 
first, banned foreign radical and violent 
preachers; second, removed the Salafi Wahhabi 
and Jamaat-e-Islami textbooks surreptitiously 
introduced to OL and AL syllabi; and third, 
designated Salafi Wahhabi groups and Jamaat-
e-Islami student wing groups.
Ideally, the Government should have built 
an enduring partnership by creating trusted 
groups within the Muslim community. The 
Government should have shared information 
and intelligence about those in custody and 
those released on bail without rehabilitation.
Unfortunately, Muslims as a community was 
suspected by the Sinhalese and Tamils. Even 
the Muslim leaders were asked to step down 
by Sinhala Buddhist extremist groups. Most 
Sri Lankan Muslim leaders are mainstream 
- except a handful, they are not religious 
fanatics. They love Sri Lanka and non-
Muslims.
Had the Muslims been taken into confidence 
by the Sri Lankan government, the outcome 
would have been to collectively build a safe 
and secure Sri Lanka for all communities. 
The Government should have permitted 
and facilitated mainstream Muslim leaders 
to visit the Easter Sunday attackers and 
supporters. Those detained were indoctrinated 
to erroneously believe that the attack was 
conducted to please Allah. In my view, most of 
the ideologues, perpetrators, and supporters 
still believe in ideology and will not lie. To me, 
they willingly and some proudly admitted to 
their role of indoctrinating, providing finance, 
and manufacturing explosives. There is an 
abundance of evidence that, as true believers, 
they perpetrated the Easter massacre. To 
me, they have admitted to their actions and 
thinking.
Such a rendezvous would have convinced 
Muslim leaders, the elite, and the community 
to realize how their faith was distorted to 
conduct a barbaric attack. In return, the 
Muslim political, clerical, and community 
leaders would have informed the community 
that there is a real problem of religious 
radicalization in the community and taken 
steps to curb religious exclusivism. This 
did not happen, unfortunately. As Muslim 
leaders did not understand the gravity of this 
challenge, many live in denial to date. Their 
ostrich-style approach has damaged Islam's 
image as a peaceful faith and the reputation of 
Muslims as a harmonious community.

It is high time for government and opposition 
leaders to develop a bipartisan approach to 
security threats. By continuously exploiting 
the Easter massacres as a political football 
to capture power and for their personal and 
political advantage, Sri Lanka will become like 
India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, where there 
are frequent riots against Muslims and attacks 
by Muslims.
The first step is to take the Muslims, especially 
their leaders, into confidence and for the 
Muslim leaders to reject conspiracy theories 
that the Easter attack was staged by the 
MOSSAD, RAW, or Sri Lankan intelligence. 
The Sri Lankan intelligence community is 
staffed at the apex and ground level by brilliant 
and patriotic Muslim rank and file, and they 
would never permit any senseless violence. If 
anyone has any doubt that the Easter massacre 
is not the work of religious fanatics, they 
should watch Zahran's farewell video and 
speak to Easter attack detainees and inmates.
My interview with Zahran's successor Noufer, 
military chief Milhan, wife Hadiya, and others 
published now in "Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday 
Massacre- Lessons for the International 
Community" gives details of how the attack 
was conceptualized, planned, prepared, and 
executed.
How can the Sri Lankan government 
and peace-loving Muslim leaders 
work together to prevent the spread of 
radical ideologies?
Salafi Wahhabi and Jamaat-e-Islami ideologies 
are politico-religious doctrines of Saudi Arabia 
and Pakistan, respectively. Both countries 
experienced religious extremism that disrupted 
their social harmony, political stability, and 
economic prosperity. Furthermore, wherever 
these ideologies traveled, they radicalized 
Muslims to attack mainstream Muslims and 
then attack non-Muslims.
The founder of Salafi-Wahhabism, Muhammad 
ibn Abd al-Wahhab, taught "al Wala Wal Bara" 
as the central piece of his doctrine. "Al Wala" 
means "loyalty" to Muslims, and "Wal Bara" 
means "hatred" of non-Muslims. Using this 
doctrine, Zahran indoctrinated thousands of 
his followers to kill non-Muslims. Zahran's 
farewell video is the best evidence.
In a multicultural country like Sri Lanka, 
where Muslims and non-Muslims live, 
coexistence will be a challenge if Muslims 
are taught to "love" only Muslims and "hate" 
non-Muslims. That is what Zahran and 
his followers did, culminating in a dozen 
incidents, including the Easter Sunday attack. 
In the first place, the Sri Lankan government 
and peace-loving Muslim leaders should have 
never allowed Wahhabi ideology to enter and 
establish a presence in Sri Lanka. After 70-80 
Saudi nationals joined al-Qaeda, Saudi leaders 
belatedly realized the danger of Wahhabism. 
Of the 19 al-Qaeda hijackers of the 9/11 attack, 
15 were citizens of Saudi Arabia. Khalid Sheikh 
Mohammed from Pakistan was the attack 
coordinator now on trial in the US.
To keep religious extremism in check, the 
religious space should be tightly controlled to 
ensure that teachings are moderate and respect 
all faiths. In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman decided to reform 
the religious space admirably. He placed 5000-
6000 radical and violent clerics in the national 
security prisons that I visited.
Similarly, Jamaat-e-Islami is the Asian version 
of the Muslim Brotherhood or Ikhwanul 
Muslimeen. Not only Christians in Egypt and 
Pakistan but mainstream Muslims witnessed

the brunt of these movements. These Islamic 
movements aim to transform their target 
countries into Islamic states and govern them 
by Sharia law. They endorse "Jihad," or holy 
war, with devastating consequences the world 
has witnessed. After the far-reaching rulers 
of UAE and Saudi Arabia realized the threat 
posed by these ideologies, they proscribed 
them.
Sri Lankan Muslim clergy, community leaders, 
and politicians should have closely guarded 
Sufism, their local and traditional Islam that 
ensured peace between Muslims and non-
Muslims for generations.
However, before and after the Easter massacre, 
these foreign ideologies started to replace Sri 
Lanka's rich Muslim cultural and religious 
heritage. Before the massacre, they accepted 
donations and facilitated the spread of these 
foreign ideologies in Sri Lanka. After the 
Easter massacre, they did not learn. They 
unashamedly campaigned for the delisting 
of Salafi Wahhabi groups. The time is right 
to take firm action against these virulent 
ideologies or pay a heavy price in the coming 
years. The Sri Lankan government should 
ban these groups, confiscate their assets, and 
pay compensation to the victims of the Easter 
attack and other attacks.
There have been allegations of 
conspiracy theories surrounding 
the Easter attack. How important is 
transparency and accountability in 
counter-terrorism efforts to build 
public trust?
Today, a few Sri Lankan Muslim leaders 
believe in conspiracy theories. These theories 
are rampant in the Arab and Muslim world,
