Islam is one of the great religions of this 
world. Except for one chapter, all the chapters 
of the Quran start with the word "mercy." 
As such, there is nothing wrong with Islam 
or the Quran, only its misinterpretation. 
Unfortunately, most Muslims are ignorant 
about Islamic history, including the Medina 
Charter, a covenant on coexistence crafted by 
Prophet Muhammad.
Like all the other religions, Islam, too, has 
assumed a political dimension. Islam is 
being misinterpreted by Muslims driven 
by politics. Due to historical developments 
and contemporary challenges, over 80% 
of the terrorist attacks worldwide are by 
Muslim threat groups, networks, cells, and 
personalities. Non-Muslims should work 
with mainstream Muslims to protect all 
communities.
Unfortunately, many Muslim leaders are 
not adequately addressing the distortion of 
their faith. A few bold and visionary Muslim 
leaders, such as Mohammed bin Salman Al 
Saud (MBS) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
(KSA), Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan 
(MBZ) of the UAE, the kings of Jordan and 
Morocco, and the sultans of Oman and Brunei, 
are taking decisive action. However, others do 
not address the threat as decisively and firmly 
as they should to turn the tide of violence.
Despite four fact-finding commissions after 
the Easter attack, some Muslim leaders 
are still promoting conspiracy theories 
and disseminating fake news about the 
governments of Israel, India, or Sri Lanka 
being behind the Easter massacre. The greatest 
harm they are doing is denying the truth about 
the ongoing Muslim radicalization.
Likewise, madrasahs have not been reformed, 
the Muslim clerics have not been accredited, 
and most importantly, five years after the 
Easter Sunday attack, its perpetrators and 
supporters have not been rehabilitated.
For personal and political reasons, Sri Lankan 
Muslim leaders have not rejected the virulent 
ideologies that have damaged harmony. It 
is not too late for them to advocate for and 
establish a form of Islam that is suitable for Sri 
Lanka, a multicultural country.
Do you think the reports suggesting 
that the LTTE played a significant role 
in radicalizing Muslims by expelling 
them from their native places in 
northern Sri Lanka and through the 
rampant killing of innocent Muslims 
are accurate?
To create a mono-ethnic Tamil state, 
Prabhakaran wished to expel the Muslims 
and Sinhalese from Sri Lanka's north and 
east. The ethnic cleansing of the Muslims 
from the north and attacks, especially the

How Could a Religious Fanatic Like Zahran

Nationalist Like Gotabhaya Rajapaksa?."

massacres in the east by the LTTE, 
radicalised the Muslims to rise. 
Tragically, 147 Muslims, including 
children, were killed on August 
3, 1990, after 30 LTTE members 
attacked Meer Jummah Mosque, 
Kattankudy-01 & Hussainiyya 
Mosque, Manchanthoduwai, where 
300 Muslims prostrated in Isha 
prayers. To protect their loved 
ones, the Muslims formed a dozen 
armed groups supported by the 
Government. The idea of "Jihad," or 
holy war, was first introduced to fight 
the LTTE.
After his father, returning from Haj 
was killed by the LTTE, a former 
policeman, Mohomed Faiz from 
Kathankudi, formed one of the first 
groups to fight the LTTE. The head of 
the military wing of Zahran's group, 
Hyathu Mohammed Ahmed Milhan 
alias Abu Shila from Kathankudi, 
was trained by Faiz to fight the LTTE 
killing of Muslims. Milhan said 
to me that he regarded Faiz as his 
mentor. To build Zahran's armory, 
Milhan and an accomplice stabbed 
and shot to death the policemen in 
Vavunathivu on November 29, 2018.  
A Tamil police officer, Dinesh 
Alagaratnam, 28, from the Kalmunai 
area, and a Sinhalese police officer, 
Niroshan Indika, 35, a father of 
one from Udugama in Galle, were 
killed at dawn while on duty at a 
police checkpoint in Vavunativu. 
Milhan used one of the weapons 
recovered to shoot Mohamed Razak 
Thaslim, coordinating secretary to 
the then Minister Kabir Hashim in 
Mawanella.
Thaslim helped the police to identify the two Jamaat-
e-Islami leaders who vandalised the Buddha statutes 
in the Mawanella, Peradeniya, and Velambada. To 
create a riot, the statues were attacked by Mohammed 
Ibrahim Sadiq Abdul Haq, who was the national 
organiser of the Jamaat-e-Islami student wing, and his 
brother Mohammed Ibrahim Shahid Abdul Haq.
Sadiq Abdul-Haq alias Abu Umair travelled to Syria in 
2014 to receive training from an al Qaeda-associated 
group. Jamaat-e Islami members helped Zahran to 
build a base for training and manufacturing explosives 
in Vanathavillu. Together with Sadiq and his father 
Ibrahim Mawlawi, Milhan conducted 17 terrorist 
training sessions, and each class had 30-35. The 
Tamils, Muslims, and Sinhalese should move forward 
from this dark phase of their history and live like one 
family.
