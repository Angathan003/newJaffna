Captaincy
S
ri Lankan Tamil cricket prodigy Sharujan 
Shanmuganathan has been appointed 
vice-captain of the Sri Lanka U19 cricket 
team for their upcoming tour of England. A 
student at St. Benedict's College, Sharujan 
rose to prominence at a very early age due 
to his stroke-making abilities, which have 
been compared to those of veteran former 
Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar 
Sangakkara. This appointment recognizes 
his impressive performance over the past 
year as both a batsman and a wicketkeeper 
for the U19 team.
The upcoming England tour will feature 
three One Day Internationals (ODIs) 
and two Test matches, offering Sharujan 
and his teammates valuable international 
experience. This series is expected to be 
a pivotal development opportunity for 
Sharujan, who still has one more year of 
eligibility in the U19 category, potentially 
paving the way for future captaincy.

Sharujan's cricket journey began at a young 
age, and his talent was recognized early on by 
the late cricket commentator Tony Greig, who 
nicknamed him "Little Sanga" in reference to 
Sri Lankan cricket legend Kumar Sangakkara. 
As Sharujan continues to grow and refine 
his skills, there is great optimism that he will 
follow in the footsteps of other U19 players 
who have gone on to achieve significant 
success at the national level.
The Sri Lanka U19 team, led by Dinura 
Kalupahana, includes players such as 
Pulindu Perera, Sadeep Samarasinghe, 
Hiran Jayasundara, Mahith Perera, Diniru 
Abeywickramasingha, Gayana Weerasinghe, 
and Thisara Ekanayake. The squad is 
18-strong, showcasing a diverse array of talent 
and potential.
Sharujan is focused on performing well for the 
U19 team, with aspirations of breaking into 
the national team. Consistent performances in 
domestic competitions and international youth 
tournaments will be key to achieving this goal. 
His dedication and potential suggest a bright 
future in Sri Lankan cricket.
In mid-February 2024, a reporter asked 
Sharujan Shanmuganathan about his 
thoughts on playing the big match between 
St. Benedict's College and Wesley College, 
considering his experience as an under-19 
Sri Lankan player who has played a few 
international cricket matches.
The reporter inquired whether it felt like a 
step down to play school matches. Sharujan 
responded with poise: "In international 
matches, I react to the ball. In school matches, 
I react to the ball. It's all about how you 
respond to each delivery. The fundamentals 
remain the same, regardless of the level of 
play." This reply characterized Sharujan's 
mature and focused approach to the game.
