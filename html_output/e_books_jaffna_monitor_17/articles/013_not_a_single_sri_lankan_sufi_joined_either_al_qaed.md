The long-term stability and security of Sri 
Lanka can be maintained by restoring its 
Sri Lankan identity. Politicians have created 
divided ethnic and religious identities for their 
own personal and political advantage.
We should ensure that all the communities 
are treated equally. Although rectified after 
the damage was done to the social fabric of 
the country, SWRD Bandaranaike's Sinhala 
Only Act divided the communities, damaged 
the minds of one generation, and destroyed 
100,000 lives. To restore harmony, Sri Lanka 
should have a Sedition Act or Maintenance of 
Religious and Ethnic Harmony Act to deter, 
prevent and prosecute people from insulting 
people of different ethnic and religious groups.
I am very proud of the current Attorney 
General, Sanjay Rajaratnam, a Tamil, and the 
current Foreign Minister, Ali Sabry, a Muslim. 
They are both brilliant and patriotic. My most 
trusted friend is a Tamil, and my accountant 
is a Muslim. To address ethnic and religious 
discrimination, the Government should ensure 
that there are no exclusively Sinhalese, Tamil, 
or Muslim schools. It is suspicion that leads to 
prejudice and resentment and resentment to 
anger, hatred, and violence. To defeat violence 
and terrorism, we must replace exclusivism 
with inclusivism and extremism with 
moderation.
Do you believe the Sri Lankan 
government's statement that the 
individuals arrested in Ahmedabad are 
drug dealers and not terrorists?
The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in Gujarat 
arrested four Sri Lankans on May 19, 2024: 
Mohamed Nusrath, 33, from Negombo; 
Mohamed Faris, 35, from Colombo 10; 
Mohamed Rasdeen, 43, from Colombo 13; 
and Mohamed Nafran, 27, from Colombo 14. 
These Islamic State suspects revealed that they 
were radicalised three to four months before 
traveling to India to attack Christian, Hindu, 
and Jewish targets.
The Sri Lankan investigation revealed that two 
of them engaged in crime, including trafficking 
drugs and smuggling other contraband items. 
To seek redemption and to atone for their past 
"Not a single Sri Lankan Sufi joined either 
Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State".
