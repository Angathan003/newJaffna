T
he Indian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) 
Tribunal has recently issued a notice to 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
demanding an explanation as to why it should 
not be declared unlawful. This action follows a 
notification by the Indian central government 
last month, which banned the LTTE, claiming 
that the organisation continued to engage 
in activities harmful to India's integrity 
and security. Given that the LTTE has been 
ultimately defeated, the method by which the 
panel sent this notice remains unclear.
On June 5, 2024, the Centre established the 
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal 
under Section 5 of the Unlawful Activities 
(Prevention) Act 1967. This Tribunal, led by 
Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora of the 
Delhi High Court, is tasked with determining 
whether there is sufficient cause to declare the 
LTTE an unlawful association.
The Tribunal directed the LTTE to submit a 
written explanation by June 14, 2024, detailing 
why it should not be deemed unlawful and 
why the government's declaration should 
not be upheld. The LTTE was also given the 
opportunity to appear before the Tribunal 
in New Delhi on July 23, 2024, and was 
represented by authorized legal counsel.

Monitor Memo
TNA Leader R. Sampanthan 
Likely to Endorse Ranil 
Wickremesinghe in 
Presidential Race, Says 
UNP Chairman
Tamil Nadu Notifies Ban
On May 18, 2024, the Tamil Nadu 
government also issued a notification 
banning the LTTE. This notice stated 
that even after its military defeat in May 
2009 in Sri Lanka, the LTTE had not 
abandoned the concept of 'Eelam' and 
continued to work towards this goal 
through fundraising and propaganda 
activities. Efforts by remaining LTTE 
leaders and cadres to regroup and 
resurrect the organisation both locally and 
internationally were also noted.
U
nited National Party (UNP) Chairman 
and Member of Parliament Vajira 
Abeywardena announced his firm belief 
that Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader 
R. Sampanthan will endorse President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe in the forthcoming 
presidential election. Abeywardena also 
expressed optimism that leaders of Tamil 
parties from the Northern and Eastern 
provinces will align with this decision, 
paving the way for unified Tamil support for 
Wickremesinghe.
"President Ranil Wickremesinghe stands out 
as one of the most politically experienced 
Sinhalese leaders in Sri Lanka, while R. 
Sampanthan is the most politically experienced 
Tamil leader with substantial political acumen," 
Abeywardena stated. "Their leadership and 
experience make them indispensable figures in 
the political landscape. We believe Sampanthan 
will support Wickremesinghe, and this decision 
will be backed by other Tamil party leaders 
from the North and East."
Abeywardena further emphasized the potential 
impact of Tamil votes in the upcoming election. 
"With the overwhelming support of Tamil 
voters from the Northern and Eastern regions, 
we are confident that Ranil Wickremesinghe 
will secure a decisive victory," he remarked.
He dismissed discussions about a Tamil 
common candidate as futile and a waste of 
time. "Our focus should be on pragmatic 
and strategic decisions that will lead to a 
historic victory for Ranil Wickremesinghe," he 
concluded.
Separatist Tendency
The notification further explained that pro-LTTE 
groups and elements continue to encourage 
separatist sentiments among the population, 
particularly in Tamil Nadu. This growing 
support for the LTTE could ultimately threaten 
India's territorial integrity. Additionally, LTTE 
sympathisers abroad have been spreading 
anti-India propaganda, blaming the Indian 
government for the LTTE's defeat. This, if 
unchecked, could foster hatred towards the 
Central Government and the Indian Constitution 
among the Tamil populace.
