esarasa Dakshitha from Jaffna University 
has set a new national record in the 
pole vault with a leap of 3.72 meters at the 
2024 National Athletics Championship. This 
achievement surpasses the previous record of 
3.71 meters, set by female army soldier Sachini 
Perera in 2022.
Dakshitha, an alumna of Chavakachcheri 
Hindu College, broke the record on June 27th, 
continuing the tradition of excellence in pole 
vaulting from Northern Sri Lanka. Before 
Sachini Perera, Anitha Jegatheeswaran, also 
from Jaffna, held the national record.
In the men's category, Arunthavarasa 
Puvitharan secured the gold medal in the 
pole vault with an impressive height of 5.00 
meters. Puvitharan, also an alumnus of 
Chavakachcheri Hindu College in Jaffna, is 
currently representing the Army Sports Club. 
Despite having set a national record of 5.17 
meters during the Army Decathlon last March,

vault event commenced at 2:30 
PM and, due to insufficient 
lighting, extended until 6:30 PM. 
The inadequate illumination 
significantly impacted his 
performance, hindering his 
ability to surpass his previous 
national record.
 He noted that the extended 
duration of the event, coupled 
with the suboptimal lighting 
conditions, created a challenging 
environment for all competitors.
Despite these obstacles, 
Puvitharan's achievement of 5.00 
meters remains a remarkable 
accomplishment, highlighting his 
skill and determination. 
Both Dakshitha and Puvitharan 
are currently coached by the 
talented Kanadheepan.
