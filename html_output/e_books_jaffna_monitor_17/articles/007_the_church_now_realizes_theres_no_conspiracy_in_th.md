F
ive years have elapsed since the devastat-
ing Easter Sunday attacks, raising a critical 
question: Are we any safer today? The recent 
arrest of four Sri Lankans by the Anti-Terror-
ism Squad of Gujarat in May 2024 underscores 
concerns about the effectiveness of measures 
to curb ongoing community radicalization. 
 
To delve into the evolving threat landscape 
from then to now, I engaged in a comprehen-
sive discussion with Professor Rohan Gu-
naratna, a preeminent authority on national 
security issues. Professor Gunaratnaâ€™s extensive 
research encompasses interviews with key fig-
ures in various armed groups, including Velu-
pillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and operatives 
at various levels within the Islamic State. 
 
Professor Gunaratna is a renowned expert on 
national, regional, and global security. His lat-
est book, "Sri Lanka's Easter Sunday Massacre: 
Lessons for the International Community," 
published by Penguin, provides vital insights 
into the escalating security threats and chal-
lenges at global, regional, national, and local 
levels.
