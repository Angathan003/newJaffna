Confronting Radicalization in Sri Lanka: 
A Multifaceted Approach
Five years have passed since the tragic Easter Sunday 
attacks, prompting an essential question: Are we any safer 
now? The recent arrest of four Sri Lankans by Gujarat's 
Anti-Terrorism Squad in May 2024 highlights ongoing 
concerns about the effectiveness of measures to combat 
community radicalization. To explore how the threat 
landscape has evolved and assess our current security 
status, We had an in-depth discussion with Professor 
Rohan Gunaratna, a leading expert on global security. 
His insights emphasize the urgent need for a nuanced and 
comprehensive approach to address the root causes of 
extremism, particularly among young Muslims.
Professor Gunaratna's analysis serves as a crucial guide 
for understanding the interplay of foreign ideologies, 
historical grievances, and socio-political dynamics that fuel 
radicalization. He traces the radicalization of a segment 
of Sri Lankan Muslims to the economic liberalization of 
1977, which facilitated the infiltration of foreign ideologies 
from the Gulf and Pakistan. These ideologies supplanted 
the traditionally peaceful Sufi practices that characterized 
Sri Lankan Islam, creating a culture of exclusivism and 
puritanism. Over time, this shift prepared the ground 
for the adoption of radical views, which were further 
exacerbated by the emergence of ultra-Tamil nationalism 
and Sinhala Buddhist extremism. The expulsion of 
Muslims by the LTTE and subsequent massacres deepened 
the sense of alienation and resentment, driving some 
towards radical ideologies as a form of self-defense and 
identity assertion.
Professor Gunaratna emphasizes that combating terrorism 
requires more than tactical and operational measures; it 
necessitates addressing the ideological roots of extremism. 
This involves scrutinizing religious teachings, reforming 
madrasah syllabi, and monitoring online platforms that 
propagate hate.

Moreover, building a strong partnership 
with Muslim community leaders is essential. 
Religious and community leaders must play 
a proactive role in countering radicalization 
by promoting traditional forms of Islam 
that emphasize peace and coexistence. 
Additionally, fostering interfaith dialogue and 
community engagement programs is crucial 
for rebuilding trust and harmony among 
different religious groups.
Professor Gunaratna's recommendations are 
strategic. He suggests fully implementing 
the recommendations of the Presidential 
Commission of Inquiry into the Easter 
Sunday attacks, training clerics to engage 
with extremists in custody, establishing 
programs to enhance interfaith relations, and 
creating Harmony Committees and Clubs to 
encourage intercultural dialogue. Furthermore, 
he advocates for the establishment of a Joint 
Information Warfare Centre to monitor and 
counter radical ideologies and the involvement 
of influential Muslim leaders to promote a 
peaceful and inclusive form of Islam.
In addressing the persistent challenge of 
radicalization in Sri Lanka, education emerges 
as a pivotal strategy. Reforming the education 
system to incorporate robust programs on 
religious tolerance, critical thinking, and 
the history of coexistence among diverse 
communities can effectively immunize 
young minds against extremist ideologies. 
Equally crucial is economic empowerment, 
which offers alternative pathways for youth 
vulnerable to radical influences.
Moreover, the Sri Lankan government and the 
majority Sinhalese population must prevent 
chauvinistic elements from exacerbating the 
radicalization of Muslim youth. Recognizing 
their role as the majority, every Sinhalese 
citizen bears a responsibility to foster an 
environment of inclusivity and reject divisive 
rhetoric that fuels extremism.
Reflecting on the lessons from the tragic 
events of 1983, where a handful of politically 
backed thugs instigated pogroms that led to 
widespread radicalization among the Tamil 
community, provides a critical historical 
perspective. This underscores the duty of 
every citizen, regardless of ethnicity, to 
actively oppose and counteract extremist 
elements within their own communities. As 
the majority, Sinhalese citizens, in particular, 
bear a significant responsibility to question 
and challenge chauvinistic elements and any 
atrocities committed in the name of their race. 
This commitment is essential for fostering a 
more inclusive and harmonious Sri Lanka.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka must strengthen its 
regional partnerships and cooperation with 
neighboring countries to enhance intelligence-
sharing and bolster joint counter-terrorism 
efforts. Establishing a multi-agency counter-
terrorism center and fostering collaborative 
security networks are critical to fortifying 
national resilience against terrorist threats.
By adopting a multifaceted approach that 
integrates education reform, economic 
empowerment, community engagement, and 
robust international cooperation, Sri Lanka can 
mitigate the risk of radicalization and foster 
a more secure and harmonious society. This 
comprehensive strategy, rooted in proactive 
measures and inclusive governance, is 
essential for safeguarding the future of all Sri 
Lankans amidst evolving security challenges.
