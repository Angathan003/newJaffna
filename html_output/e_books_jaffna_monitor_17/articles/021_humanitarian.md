N
iththilan (name changed), a former 
courageous United Nations worker, 
witnessed the harrowing scenes of Sri Lanka's 
final war in 2009. Among the few living 
who can testify to the devastating atrocities 
committed by both the Sri Lankan government 
and the LTTE, he played a crucial role in the 
conflict's final stages. In September 2008, 
after the directive for the evacuation of UN 
and international humanitarian organizations 
from LTTE-controlled territories, Niththilan 
was appointed as the officer in charge of 
all UN operations in the region. He led the 
UN mission within LTTE-controlled areas, 
directing local staff in the absence of his 
international colleagues. Currently residing in 
Europe, Niththilan has decided to break his 
silence and share his experiences with 'Jaffna 
Monitor' under the condition of anonymity.
How many shells landed inside the UN 
hub in the no-fire zone?
Based on my estimations, approximately 25 
shells landed inside the UN hub on the first 
day. The following day, we left the no-fire 
zone, although food distribution continued 
at the UN hub. While people were lined up to 
receive food items, the government shelled the 
area, resulting in numerous casualties. Those 
standing in line were brutally killed.
Later, I met with a general whose name has 
been frequently associated with allegations 
of war crimes and confronted him by asking,

"Why did you shell the no-fire zone?" Initially, he 
denied it, but after much hesitation, he admitted 
it was true. He explained that they had no choice 
but to compel the people from the LTTE-controlled 
area to move into their territory. While making this 
admission, he showed no emotions; he was not happy 
but resolute in his justification.
Where and how did you end up meeting 
him?
That's a long story..." Niththilan paused for a long 
moment, gathering his thoughts before continuing. 
"Before that, you should ask me how we, the UN 
workers, escaped the war zone."
Ok... How did UN workers finally escape 
from the war zone?
We were desperate to escape the war zone. In our 
plight, I wrote a heartfelt letter to Balasingham 
Nadesan, the head of the LTTE's political wing, 
pleading for our family members to be allowed 
to leave. At that time, all the UN staff in the 
LTTE-held area were men, and the thought 
of our families' safety weighed heavily on our 
minds. In my letter, I assured the LTTE that if 
they permitted our families to leave, we male 
UN staff members would remain with the 
LTTE until the end. Every male worker at 
the UN signed that letter, demonstrating our 
collective desperation and commitment.
However, the response we received was 
disheartening. "We cannot let your family 
members leave the war zone. It will set 
a bad precedent," Nadesan replied. His 
words shattered our hopes, leaving us 
to grapple with the harsh reality of our 
situation.
Managing my staff became immensely 
difficult due to the lack of proper

bunkers, shelters, and adequate food. In the 
midst of this chaos, I managed to secretly send 
15 of my staff members and their families 
on a ship under the guise of being wounded. 
However, I still had 115 UN staff members 
with me, and the responsibility for their safety 
weighed heavily on my shoulders.
We devised a plan for a 15-member team of 
men, women, and children to escape the war 
zone through the Nandikadal Lagoon. This 
was essentially a pilot program, and the head 
of this mission was a brave UN worker from 
Kilinochchi. He took the lead despite the 
uncertainty of reaching the army-controlled 
area amidst intense fighting.
There was a lady in the group whose infant 
child was gravely illâ€”they needed to leave the 
war zone urgently, or else the child would die. 
I had initially arranged for her to leave on one 
of the ICRC ships and obtained the necessary 
pass from the LTTE office due to the child's 
critical condition.
However, near the ship, Varathan, an LTTE 
leader in charge of transport, stopped her 
and her child, accusing them of being traitors 
to Tamil Eelam. He shouted at her, citing 
the reason: her husband, a UN worker, had 
previously helped his brother escape from the 
LTTE-controlled area.
Varathan forcefully removed the mother 
and her gravely ill infant from the ship, 
proclaiming, "We show no mercy to traitors 
of Tamil Eelam." In the melee, he even labeled 
the infant as a traitor. The scene was heart-
wrenching, as the mother's desperate pleas for 
her child's life fell on deaf ears.
I confronted Varathan, arguing that it was 
An injured Tamil civilian lies in a makeshift hospital, a victim of brutal shelling by the Sri Lankan government, highlighting the 
devastating impact on innocent lives.

unjust to punish this innocent child for the 
actions of his father. I implored him, saying, 
"If you don't allow this infant to leave on this 
ship, she will die." Varathan, with a chilling 
calmness, responded, "We have enough land 
to bury this child if it dies." His words pierce 
through me even today.
What was her husband's 
transgression?
He was a UN worker who, using a UN vehicle, 
covertly helped his brother escape from the 
LTTE-controlled area to the army-controlled 
area to avoid forced enlistment by the LTTE. 
He concealed his brother in the vehicle during 
this operation.
Did he come back again?
No, he did not return. Had he come back, the 
LTTE would have arrested him and forced him 
into enlistment.
What happened to Varathan?
I heard that he took his own life in the last days 
of the war in Mullivaikkal.
Returning to the main story, this woman and 
her child were part of a team of 15 members 
who were included in our pilot escape program 
from the LTTE-held area. We notified the 
army through our Vavuniya office about the 
group's escape attempt. Around 1:30 AM one 
night, they began their journey in complete 
secrecy. Suddenly, intense fighting erupted, 
and they found themselves caught in the 
crossfire with bombs falling heavily around 
them. I was terrified, fearing they had all 
perished.
The next morning, around 10 AM, I received 
a call from my colleague who was in charge of 
the UN Department for Safety and Security 
(UNDSS) based in Vavunia,  confirming the 
safe arrival of our group of UN workers. The 
team leader urged me to send another group 
and implored me to join them. I responded 
unequivocally, "I am the captain of this ship; 
I will only leave when every staff member has 
safely exited the war zone.
Later, I received a call from the woman's sister, 
who had been forced off the ship by Varathan. 
She, who was calling me from the UK, 
informed me that her sister was in the hospital. 
I later learned that during their escape, she 
had stepped on a landmine and lost her entire 
leg. Remarkably, their group leader carried her 
on his shoulders for three kilometers. When I 
asked my UNDSS Colleague why he had not 
informed me about the incident, he replied, 
"Had I told you, you would not have sent 
another batch of UN workers. That is why I did 
not tell you. 
By the end of March 2009, I had successfully 
coordinated the evacuation of multiple groups 
of UN staff and their families in a manner 
similar to the initial deployment. Only my 
family, myself, and a few remaining personnel 
were left in the conflict area by this time.
How did you and the remaining UN 
workers finally escape from the LTTE-
controlled area?
The Tigers had established forward defense 
positions along the shores of Nandikadal 
Lagoon specifically to prevent Tamil civilians 
from fleeing LTTE-held territories. The LTTE 
fighters manning these positions were ordered 
to shoot any civilians attempting to escape. 
Approaching the sea without being detected at 
these checkpoints was nearly impossible.

We devised a strategy accordingly. Two of 
our local United Nations staff members 
approached one of these positions and 
gradually befriended the LTTE members 
guarding it. After several days of building 
rapport, we managed to bribe the LTTE 
fighters at that position with 25,000 rupees, 
securing their agreement to let us pass during 
the night. The Tigers, who prided themselves 
on never having accepted a bribe before, took 
the 25,000 rupees and allowed us to escape 
through Nandikadal Lagoon to the army-
controlled area.
They informed us that a particular night would 
present the optimal opportunity for escape. I 
personally funded the necessary bribe. At that 
time, even a single sovereign of jewelry in the 
Vanni region was valued at less than 3,000 
rupees. The fighters likely needed the funds, 
perhaps even to plan their own eventual escape 
from the conflict zone. I do not blame the 
fighters who accepted the bribe under these 
circumstances.
Instead, I attribute responsibility to the 
leadership that placed them in such a 
precarious position. It is probable that these 
fighters were conscripted against their will. 
Who can say for certain?
