influencing their poorly educated masses. They 
think the 9/11 attack was staged by the CIA to 
justify the US invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq 
and that the Hamas attack was orchestrated by 
MOSSAD to justify the Israeli occupation of 
Gaza.
Conspiracy theories surround almost all 
catastrophic attacks, from 9/11 to the Bali 
bombing. Regarding the Easter Sunday 
attack, the Sri Lankan government is also not 
without fault. Despite receiving comprehensive 
intelligence from India about a pending attack, 
Sri Lankan political leaders, defence officers, 
and law enforcement authorities did not act 
swiftly. They pandered to politics.
Intelligence on the enemy will never be 
complete, accurate, or up-to-date. Every 
leader and commander must take action with 
partially available intelligence based on their 
intuition, maturity, expertise, and experience. 
Intelligence is not merely a jobâ€”it is a 
craft. Only the trained and experienced can 
accurately read the threat.
When they received intelligence of a pending 
attack, the Sri Lankan government should have 
deployed hunting teams to catch or kill Zahran 
and his team and protected the churches 
and hotels. At least, the Government should 
have made the threat information about 
the perpetrators and attack plans public. As 
national security was the brand of the previous 
Government, Yahapalanaya leaders did not 
take national security seriously. The country 
paid a heavy price for politics.

The conspiracy theories surrounding the 
Easter Sunday attack in Sri Lanka have no 
basis. I interviewed almost everyone detained, 
reviewed their debriefings, and examined 
their electronics. In addition to domestic 
law enforcement authorities investigating 
the Easter attack, international police and 
intelligence services, as well as INTERPOL, 
also investigated the attack. Over the past 
five years, New Scotland Yard, the FBI, 
CIA, AFP, RAW, IB, Mossad, and other law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies have 
not disputed the findings. Additionally, the US 
indicted the main accused. Four fact-finding 
reports concluded that the attack was driven 
by Muslim religious extremism, a global 
phenomenon.
Catholics questioned how God could allow 
the faithful to be killed in houses of worship. 
This caused a crisis in the Church and in 
the community. Despite the efforts of the 
Cardinal's legal advisor, Shammil Perera PC, a 
brilliant and farsighted leader, to educate the 
Church, the Easter attack was turned into a 
political tool. The misinformed and misguided 
believe that there is a conspiracy behind the 
Easter Sunday attack. How could a religious 
fanatic like Zahran commit suicide to please 
a Sinhala Buddhist nationalist like Gotabhaya 
Rajapaksa?
After all questions from the Church were 
answered by the investigators, the Cardinal 
requested all the volumes of the Presidential 
Commission of Inquiry led by Justice Janaka 
de Silva, a competent and hardworking legal 
expert. The Cardinal received the entire set 
of volumes, something another government 
might not have done. Without basis, the 
Church went too far in accusing the security 
forces of staging the attack to bring the 
Rajapaksas to power. Now, the Church has 
realized there is no conspiracy. However, the 
extent to which they went is too far to retract.
To buy indefinite time, the Church is now 
using different third parties to create new or 
renew old conspiracy theories each year as a 
getaway strategy. From the initial conspiracy 
theories, the Church has now deviated. All this 
has damaged the nation's security - it divided 
the Catholics and non-Catholics and stopped 
the rehabilitation plans.
My opinion is that an international 
investigation is not necessary as foreign 
governments have already concluded that 
the massacre was conducted by religious 
extremists. However, if the next Government 
wishes, we should constitute an independent 
investigative body with foreign and local 
experts. This is not to start a fresh investigation 
but to revisit and review the investigations 
conducted so far, find out any lapses, and then 
investigate those gaps. Then, the Government 
can come to a conclusion as to whether the 
investigations were conducted appropriately 
and determine what exactly happened.
The conspiracy theory surrounding the Easter 
Sunday attack was introduced by power-
hungry Sinhala politicians. It was conveniently 
embraced by the Church, the grieving party. 
Not all Catholics believe in it. The damage to 
national security is huge - social cohesion was 
compromised and the counter radicalisation 
program was disrupted. When those in 
custody are released, they will harm others, 
inflect others, and will be hailed as heroes.
What long-term strategies do you 
believe are essential for Sri Lanka 
to implement to ensure the safety 
and security of its citizens while 
addressing the underlying issues of 
radicalization?
