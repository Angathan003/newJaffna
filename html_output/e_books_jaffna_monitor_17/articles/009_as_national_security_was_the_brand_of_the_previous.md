The strategy is to get mainstream Muslims to 
rehabilitate the deviant Muslims in custody 
and those released back to society without 
correcting their belief. If governments and 
Muslim clerical bodies do not rehabilitate 
those with distorted views about their religion, 
they will pose a security threat, will infect 
others, and will be hailed as heroes.
There are three knowledge gaps. First, there is 
a lack of expertise and experience in dealing 
with Muslim religious exclusivism and 
extremism. As Muslim religious extremism is 
on the rise, the Government should establish 
a counter-terrorism research and training 
centre with expertise and experience in 
religious extremism and terrorism. Second, the 
Government should establish dedicated courts, 
educate and train judges and prosecutors in 
counter-terrorism, and build special prisons 
for terrorist and extremist prisoners.
Specialisation is key to manage the current 
and emerging threat. Third, ACJU leadership 
should train and certify every cleric to promote 
moderation, tolerance, and coexistence. Anti-
radicalisation and counter radicalisation 
should be the responsibility of the clerical 
body. The entire leadership of the group 
that staged the Easter attack were Muslim 
clerics. As such, mentoring, grooming, and 
supervising the clerics are vital. Fourth, the 
Government of Sri Lanka should send its best 
and brightest officers to study Arabic and how 
Muslim religious extremism is dealt with in 
Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. These three 
countries' leaders and security and intelligence 
services have built significant knowledge and 
understanding of the threat.
Given your insights on Islam and the 
rise of religious extremism, what 
steps do you believe are essential for 
Muslim leaders, particularly in Sri 
Lanka, to take in order to address and 
counteract the radicalization within 
their communities?
