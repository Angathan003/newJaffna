hen I fi rst met Matale Suneetha Th ero, I couldn’t 
help but be captivated by his mastery of the Tamil 
language. His way with Tamil wasn’t just fl uent; it was 
eloquent, technically precise, and grammatically impeccable. I was 
genuinely surprised to fi nd a Sinhala-Buddhist monk speaking 
Tamil so fl uently. My astonishment got the better of me, and I 
asked, “How did you become so profi cient in Tamil?”
With a wry smile, he replied, “Actually, you should be asking me 
how I became fl uent in Sinhala, not the other way around. I’m 
Tamil, born to Tamil parents in the heart of Matale. 
He continued, “Th ere’s a common misconception that all 
Buddhists are Sinhalese and that Buddhism is exclusive to the 
Sinhalese in Sri Lanka. But that’s far from the truth. Centuries ago, 
before the Chola and Kalinga Magha invasions, Buddhism was 
the predominant religion among Tamils in Sri Lanka. While my 
immediate ancestors followed Saivism, I feel a deep connection to 
the Buddhist path, which resonates with the beliefs and practices 
of my forefathers.”
He continued. “You know,  particularly in the northern and 
eastern regions. Now, predominantly Tamil-majority areas 
have a rich history with Buddhism. Th ey were home to Tamil-
speaking communities that played a pivotal role in spreading and 
nurturing Buddhism in the country. What’s really intriguing is 
that Buddhism made its mark in these parts of Sri Lanka before it 
reached the areas that are now predominantly Sinhalese-majority. 
Th is means that the infl uence of Buddhism in these Tamil-
majority regions actually predates its expansion into the areas 
where the Sinhalese community eventually became the majority. 
It’s a testament to the deep-rooted connection between Buddhism 
and the cultural history of these Tamil-speaking regions.
