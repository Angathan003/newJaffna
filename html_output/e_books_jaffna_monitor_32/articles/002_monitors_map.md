Greetings, readers!
Today, as we unveil the fi rst issue of the "Jaff na Monitor," there's an unmis-
takable thrill in the air and a responsibility we are determined to uphold. 
We embark on this journalistic journey with a clear vision, as evident in 
our name: we are here to monitor.
Th e news world is vast and intricate, brimming with perspectives and 
narratives. But amidst this diversity, one thing remains constant: the truth. 
Our commitment to you, our dear readers, is to provide news untouched 
by bias and free from political leanings. In an era where the lines between 
facts and fi ction are oft en blurred, we pledge to be the torchbearers of 
integrity and honesty.
Th is venture is the brainchild of a group of passionate individuals from the 
'90s – a generation that grew up amidst change and now wants to be the 
change. We're not just journalists but doctors, scientists, engineers, and 
professionals from diverse fi elds. Every team member brings expertise and 
perspective, ensuring our content is comprehensive and multifaceted.
But why the decision to embark on this journalistic journey? We real-
ize words' immense power and their role in shaping minds. We want our 
future generations to grow up reading quality English, to think critically, 
and to question the world around them. We aim to be the catalyst for this 
very change.
Our mission goes beyond just reporting news. We delve deep, providing 
detailed, in-depth articles that don't just skim the surface but dive into 
the core of matters. We are here to question, challenge, and redefi ne the 
so-called standard norms of journalism. In our pursuit, we off er a diff erent 
perspective that oft en questions the status quo and challenges entrenched 
beliefs. For too long, the dynamics of power have dictated and infl uenced 
narratives. Th e Jaff na Monitor aims to break this mold. We stand unbowed, 
unafraid, and unyielding in our relentless quest for the truth.
We invite you to join us on this journey. Dive deep into our articles, ques-
tion our narratives, engage with our team, and, most importantly, hold 
us accountable. In this dynamic relationship between the reader and the 
publisher, the essence of trustworthy journalism thrives.

M
aaveerar Naal, also known as Great Heroes’ Day, is a day of 
remembrance observed by Sri Lankan Tamils, primarily by supporters 
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Th is day is dedicated 
to honouring the sacrifi ces of militants who fought alongside the LTTE to pursue 
an independent Tamil homeland. While it is important to remember those who 
fought for the LTTE, it is equally crucial to acknowledge the existence of various 
other liberation movements representing Sri Lankan Tamils. Th ese groups and 
their members have oft en been overshadowed, and their sacrifi ces have gone 
unnoticed due to the dominance of the LTTE in the narrative.
The Multifaceted Tamil Struggle
Th e Tamil struggle for independence is not a monolithic movement led solely by 
the LTTE. Over the years, several other militant organisations emerged, each with 
its objectives and methods to achieve an independent Tamil homeland. Th ese 
groups were born out of a shared aspiration for Tamil self-determination, and 
many of their members were driven by pure intentions to liberate their people 
from the oppression they faced.

The LTTE’s Dominance and Consequences
Under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran, 
the LTTE emerged as the predominant force 
in the Sri Lankan Tamil struggle. Gaining 
notoriety for its relentless tactics and steadfast 
dedication to its mission, the LTTE also 
clamped down on other Tamil militant groups. 
Rival factions were outlawed, and their leaders 
and members were oft en brutally executed by 
the LTTE, labelled as traitors.
A Day to Remember the Forgotten Heroes
While Maaveerar Naal serves as a day to 
commemorate the LTTE militants who 
fought for Tamil independence, there is a 
pressing need for a separate day dedicated to 
remembering the youths who were driven by 
their passion for the Tamil cause but were part 
of diff erent groups. Th ese individuals also made 
signifi cant sacrifi ces and endured immense 
hardships pursuing Tamil self-determination.
Remembering Intellectuals and Politicians
Several esteemed fi gures in politics 
and intellectual circles, including A. 
Amirthalingam, Alfred Duraiappah, Neelan 
Tiruchelvam, Rajani Th iranagama, C. E. 
Anandarajah, and V. M. Panchalingam, 
tragically lost their lives to the LTTE due to
