He continued, “A pivotal moment in the spread of 
Buddhism in this region revolves around Sangamittā, 
the daughter of Emperor Ashoka. She undertook a 
remarkable mission, carrying with her a sacred branch 
of the Bodhi Tree—an esteemed symbol of Buddhism—
from India to Sri Lanka. Her arrival took place at the 
ancient port of Dambakola Patuna, which we now 
recognize as Mathagal, situated within the Jaff na region 
of Sri Lanka. Arrived in Dambakola Patuna, she made 
her way to Anuradhapura. Th is remarkable journey 
traversed predominantly Tamil-speaking areas. As she 
made her way from Mathagal to Anuradhapura, her 
presence and the sacred branch of the Bodhi Tree, she 
carried profoundly impacted the local communities 
along the route. Many people in these areas embraced 
Buddhism, inspired by Buddha’s teachings and 
Sangamittā’s mission. Th is journey played a signifi cant 
role in spreading Buddhism and fostering Buddhist 
communities in these Tamil-speaking regions.
He went on, “Indeed, it’s disheartening to see the 
prevailing misconception in modern Sri Lanka, which 
wrongly associates Buddhism solely with the Sinhalese. 
Th e real story is far more inclusive. Buddhism had a rich 
and enduring legacy among the Tamil population. Tamil 
scholars and Buddhist monks of Tamil descent have 
played crucial roles in spreading the profound teachings 
of the Buddha’s Dhamma.”
“As you might know,” he continued, “the Five Great 
Epics—Silappatikāram, Manimekalai, Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi, 
Valayapathi, and Kuṇṭalakēci—are treasured in Tamil 
culture. Manimekalai and Kuṇṭalakēci were craft ed 
by Buddhists, while the other three were composed 
by Tamil Jains. Interestingly, Tamil Saivites did not 
contribute any epics in this context, underscoring the 
diverse religious landscape of ancient Tamil society.”
“Furthermore,” he emphasized, “it’s crucial to grasp a 
fundamental aspect. Buddha explicitly stated that his 
teachings should transcend any specifi c race or religion. 
He vehemently opposed the creation of any religious 
sect in his name. Instead, he off ered the Dhamma—a 
universal way of life. His teachings and his Dhamma, 
are intended for all sentient beings, transcending any 
particular ethnic or cultural group. It’s vital to recognize 
this universal aspect of Buddhism and wholeheartedly 
embrace its inclusive nature.”
He took a deep breath, momentarily interrupting his 
extended monologue. 
To be continued.
On October 18, a curious 
event unfolded. Th e former 
northern chief minister, C. 
V. Vigneswaran, alongside 
some parliament members, 
penned a letter to actor 
Vijay. Th eir request? To 
delay the release of ‘Lio’ 
from October 19, given 
their scheduled protest on 
October 20. It’s common 
knowledge that an actor, even one of Vijay’s immense 
stature, doesn’t hold the cards regarding release dates. Th ose 
decisions are typically in the hands of production houses. 
However, in a move that puzzled many, our representatives 
seemed to sidestep the practical route of appealing to 
distributors, theatre owners, or Vijay’s enthusiastic fanbase. 
Maybe they assumed these groups were out of their sphere 
of infl uence, or perhaps they were all too aware that their 
request might fall on deaf ears. Not surprisingly, this 
decision became fodder for mockery on various social 
platforms.
Venturing into Vigneswaran’s historical escapades, he has 
a knack for audacious requests. Earlier in his tenure as 
the Chief Minister of Northern province, he took to his 
writing desk to dispatch a letter to Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi, seeking leniency for the convicts in the 
Swami Premananda case. Swamy Premananda wasn’t just 
any spiritual guide. He was embroiled in—and subsequently 
convicted of—serious off ences, including multiple rape 
cases and a murder. And to thicken the plot, Vigneswaran 
isn’t merely an observer from afar; he’s a devout disciple of 
Swamy Premananda.
Given Vigneswaran’s affi  liation with Swami Premananda, 
eyebrows have been raised regarding the wisdom behind 
his political choices. Nevertheless, C. V. seems set on 
continuing his distinctive brand of political theatrics.
Guess what? C. V. Vigneswaran and his parliament buddies 
played the ‘not us’ card on the very next day, claiming they 
never penned a note to superstar Vijay. But word on the 
street is they did scribble that letter to Vijay. And they did a 
classic switcheroo when things got giggly, and the joke was 
on them! Oh, Jaff na politics!

I
n the 16th century, Palestine, situated 
at the crossroads of the Middle 
East, became a part of the vast 
Ottoman Empire. It was divided into six 
administrative regions, one of them being 
the district of Gaza, which stretched from 
Jaff a in the north (now within Israel) to 
Rafah in the south, adjacent to Egypt’s 
border. Th is structure persisted for over four 
centuries under Ottoman rule.
By the 19th century, Jewish immigrants 
began arriving in Palestine, primarily 
seeking sanctuary from European 
persecution. As World War I approached 
its conclusion in 1917, the British 
captured Palestine from the weakening 
Ottoman Empire. Th e same year, the 
British Balfour Declaration supported 
a “national home for the Jewish people” 
in Palestine. Consequently, modern-day 
Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza came under 
British mandate aft er the war. Th is period 
witnessed signifi cant Jewish immigration, 
which, combined with longstanding Arab 
residency, set the stage for heightened 
Arab-Jewish tensions, culminating in violent 
confrontations in the 1930s.

Aft er World War II and with a signifi cant 
Jewish presence established, Britain 
withdrew from Palestine, referring the 
matter to the United Nations. Th e UN 
put forth a partition plan: separate Jewish 
and Arab states, with Jerusalem under 
international administration. While this 
was accepted by Jewish leaders, it was 
rejected by the Arab leadership. 1948, as 
the British mandate ended, the State of 
Israel was proclaimed. Th e declaration 
of Israel sparked a war, pulling fi ve Arab 
countries into the fray. When peace was 
restored, territories had new boundaries: 
Egypt governed the Gaza Strip, and Jordan 
oversaw the West Bank. Beyond territorial 
shift s, the war led to the displacement of 
around 700,000 Palestinians. Many sought 
shelter in Gaza, drastically changing its 
demographic makeup quickly.
Th e subsequent decades saw shift ing 
control over the territories. In 1967, 
following another war, Israel took 
control of both Gaza and the West Bank. 
Th e latter half of the 20th century saw 
the emergence of various Palestinian 
factions, each with distinct visions, from 
the secular PLO to Islamist groups like 
Hamas.

Palestinian resistance to Israeli 
governance led to two signifi cant 
uprisings or intifadas. Th e peace 
process, marked by events like the 
1993 Oslo Accords, aimed to navigate 
a path toward Palestinian statehood. 
However, its execution was met 
with numerous challenges, leading 
to continued unrest, notably with 
Hamas playing a signifi cant role in 
the subsequent upheavals.
In the early 21st century, Israel 
disengaged from Gaza in 2005, 
though this was not universally seen 
as a gesture of peace. Following 
a 2006 election, Hamas emerged 
dominant in Gaza, leading to internal 
Palestinian political divisions. Given 
Israel’s classifi cation of Hamas 
as a terrorist organization, the 
subsequent blockade around Gaza 
has led to profound economic and 
humanitarian consequences. Referred 
to as the world’s “largest open 
prision,” it grapples with skyrocketing 
unemployment and infrastructural 
challenges with the populace caught 
in political agendas.
Today, with its immense population 
density, the Gaza Strip remains at 
the heart of the Israel-Palestine 
discourse. Th e audacious ground 
incursion by Hamas on October 7 
marks a deviation from the norm, 
challenging Israel’s longstanding 
security paradigms and thrusting the 
Israel-Palestine confl ict back into the 
global limelight. As Israel retaliates, 
the cyclical nature of this decades-
long strife reaffi  rms the need for a 
sustainable solution.
Th e history of the Gaza Strip off ers a 
window into the intricate dynamics 
of Middle Eastern geopolitics. 
Recognizing the aspirations and 
concerns of all parties is essential for 
a resolution that promotes human 
rights, security, and peace for both 
Israelis and Palestinians.

Origins and Ideological Foundations:
Emerging during the tempestuous times of the fi rst Intifada in 1987 
in the Gaza Strip, Hamas quickly established itself as a signifi cant 
actor in the Palestinian narrative. Guided by Sheikh Ahmed Yasin 
and Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi, Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood primarily 
infl uenced its foundational ideologies. Distinct from the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas questions Israel’s right to 
exist, advocating for a Palestinian nation Conversely, the LTTE 
envisioned and led by Velupillai Prabhakaran was established in 1976 
as a response to escalating tensions and perceived discrimination 
against Tamils by the Sinhalese-majority Sri Lanka. Aimed at forging 
an independent Tamil nation, the group’s inception was profoundly 
infl uenced by ethnic disparities and resentments.

Between Resistance and Ruthlessness: 
The Harsh Realities of 
Hamas and LTTE’s Tactics
In geopolitics, two resistance organizations conspicuously stand 
out for their strategies, significance, and controversy: Hamas, 
originating in the Palestinian territories, and the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from Sri Lanka.

Tactics, Civilian Engagement, and Internal Dynamics:
Th e LTTE, militarily defeated in 2009, and Hamas 
have faced scrutiny for their approach to civilian safety. 
While LTTE’s operations in densely populated areas 
in the past sometimes heightened risks for civilians 
during counterattacks, Hamas continues to operate in 
such sites, leading to potential civilian casualties during 
confrontations with Israelis. Th ese incidents oft en garner 
international sympathy and aid in recruitment eff orts.
Despite the diff ering contexts, One common tactic between 
the two entities is the use of suicide bombings. Th e LTTE is 
credited with popularizing suicide bombings, while Hamas 
has also targeted buses, restaurants, and public areas with 
such attacks. Th ese bombings aren’t just a military strategy 
but also aim to send a psychological message.
Th ough arising from diff erent cultural contexts, both 
groups bear the indelible mark of targeting defenseless 
civilians from opposing factions. Hamas’s actions against 
unsuspecting Israelis, paralleled by the LTTE’s assaults on 
innocent Sinhalese, have elicited widespread international 
censure. Th eir strategies, intent on instilling fear, frequently 
unfold with little to no consideration for civilian casualties
For instance, during its 2009 confl ict, the LTTE notoriously 
used Tamil civilians as Human shields. Similarly, Hamas 
has embedded its operations within the dense populace 
of Gaza, establishing numerous tunnels in civilian zones. 
Such tactics indicate that both groups may prioritize their 
agendas over the safety of the people they represent.

Moral and Ethical Dilemmas: Use of Child Soldiers
Child soldiers have been a grievous point of contention in 
the tactics of both Hamas and the LTTE. Th e LTTE has a 
notorious history of recruiting and deploying child soldiers 
in its combat ranks. As documented by organizations 
such as Human Rights Watch and UNICEF, the LTTE 
oft en forcibly conscripted children, some as young as 12. 
Parents in the Tamil regions lived in perpetual fear of their 
children being abducted and indoctrinated into the LTTE’s 
militant cause. On the other hand, Hamas, while not as 
systematically involved in child recruitment as the LTTE, 
has faced accusations of using children in its military 
endeavors. Reports from groups like the Palestinian 
Center for Human Rights have highlighted instances 
where children were involved in militant parades, digging 
tunnels, and sometimes even participating in hostilities 
against Israel. Th e use of child soldiers by both groups not 
only contravenes international law but also underscores the 
severe ethical compromises these organizations have made 
in their respective struggles.
Elimination of Dissent: An Unsavory Commonality
Hamas has been known to execute Palestinians, especially 
those suspected of collaborating with Israel or challenging 
their governance model in Gaza. Th e LTTE’s intolerance 
to alternative viewpoints led to the elimination of many 
Tamils who proposed diff erent avenues of confl ict 
resolution. During its prolonged confl ict with the Sri 
Lankan government, the LTTE was implicated in killing 
many Tamils whom they labeled traitors or collaborators. 
In several instances, these internal killings surpassed the 
number of Tamils killed by the Sri Lankan military during 
specifi c periods of the confl ict.
Both movements have exhibited a dark inclination to 
eliminate internal dissent, assassinating many within their 
ranks and branding them as traitors. A striking example 
within the LTTE was labeling its deputy, Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja (known as Mahattaya), as a traitor, leading 
to his execution. During the Eastern-Wanni split, the LTTE 
killed thousands of its fi ghters from the Eastern division. 
Similarly, when the LTTE expelled Muslims from northern 
and southern Sri Lanka, all the Muslim fi ghters within its 
ranks were eliminated.
Over the years, reports have indicated that Hamas has 
killed those perceived as internal threats. For instance, 
during the 2014 confl ict with Israel, Hamas reportedly 
executed several Palestinians accused of collaborating with 
Israel without a fair trial. Aft er its violent takeover of Gaza 
in 2007, Hamas was also accused of persecuting members 
of rival factions, especially those affi  liated with Fatah.

International Sympathy, Perception, and Financing:
Internationally, Hamas is recognized as a terrorist 
organization by signifi cant entities, including the US, EU, 
and Canada. Yet, they’ve managed to secure support from 
nations like Iran and Turkey. By framing its resistance as a 
pan-Islamic cause, Hamas has also garnered sympathy from 
the global Muslim community.
Th e LTTE faced similar international condemnation, 
designated as a terrorist entity by 32 countries, including 
powerhouses like the US, India, and the EU. Th eir global 
operations were extensive, relying on international 
networks for arms procurement, fundraising, and lobbying. 
Th e LTTE and Hamas have leveraged their military 
successes to appeal to international sympathizers for 
fi nancial support. Diaspora Tamils and the global Muslim 
community have fi nancially bolstered the LTTE’s and 
Hamas’s operations, respectively.
The Dichotomy of Motives and Methods:
Both groups were established in response to genuine 
societal grievances and a need for representation. However, 
their chosen methods, oft en endangering and even harming 
the civilians they professed to champion, blurred ethical 
lines and posed moral quandaries.
Th e intricate narratives of Hamas and LTTE off er a 
multifaceted view of the challenges resistance movements 
encounter in the modern era. Th eir formation, rooted 
in undeniable grievances juxtaposed against their oft en 
questionable methods, provides deep insight into the moral 
and tactical dilemmas resistance movements face in their 
quest for justice and identity.
C
ue dramatic music! On the 20th, 
Northern and Eastern Provinces 
became the stage for a political thriller. 
Seven Tamil political parties announced 
a hartal, raising a fuss over the so-called 
death threats to Mullaitivu District Judge 
T. Saravanaraja. But there’s a twist! Th ey 
also threw in some spice by opposing 
new Buddhist temples and land transfers 
in the region.
Enter the traders with a grand gesture: 
the Northern Provincial Traders 
Association put up their ‘Closed’ signs. 
Th e magistrates? Oh, they played it cool 
and reported to work. Lawyers, however, 
decided to take a day off , maybe to 
binge-watch their favourite shows?
A signifi cant twist to this narrative has 
emerged with Judge T. Saravanaraja’s 
relocation to Canada. Whispers are 
everywhere. Was this all an Oscar-
worthy performance to snag that coveted 
Canadian asylum? Some say if he was 
in danger, he’d stay and rally the masses, 
maybe even star in his action-packed 
sequel!
Amidst all this drama, major retail 
players like Cargills Food City rolled 
out the red carpet, attracting shoppers 
in droves. Furthermore, the decision 
to conduct the hartal on a Friday came 
under public scrutiny. Usually, Muslim-
owned shops are either fully or partially 
closed on Fridays, owing to the Friday 
prayers. Critics argue that the organizers 
intentionally capitalized on this regular 
closure to exaggerate the hartal’s impact.
And, in a surprise crossover episode, 
Muslim-majority areas shift ed the 
spotlight to support Palestine instead of 
our leading judge.
One thing is evident in this whirlwind of 
events: while some bought the premiere 
tickets to the Hartal show, many were 
left  wondering about the authenticity 
of the judge’s plotline and his sudden 
Canadian escapade! Stay tuned for the 
next episode!

T
he Tamils of Sri Lanka called 
him ‘the Sage of Jaff na.’ 
His thousands of devotees, 
including many Singhalese Buddhists 
and Christians, called him a saint. 
Some of those closest to him 
referred to him as the ‘Old Lion,’ or 
‘Bodhidharma reborn,’ for he could be 
very fi erce and unpredictable, chasing 
away unwelcome supplicants with a 
stick. I just called him Swami. He was 
my introduction to Hinduism in its 
pure Vedanta form and my teacher 
for the nearly four years I served as 
the Canadian High Commissioner 
in what was still called Ceylon in the 
early sixties when I was there.
For the previous ten years I had 
been apprenticed in the Gurdjieff  
Work, and it was through a former 
student of P. D. Ouspensky, James 
Ramsbotham (now Lord Soulbury), 
and his brother Peter, that, one hot 
aft ernoon, not long aft er our arrival 
in Ceylon, I found myself outside a 
modest thatched hut in Jaff na, on the 
northern shore of Ceylon, to keep my 
fi rst appointment with.
I knocked quietly on the door, and 
a voice from within roared, ‘Is that 
the Canadian High Commissioner?’ 
I opened the door to fi nd him seated 
cross-legged on the fl oor, sitting 
erect with a commanding presence, 
clad in a white robe, with a generous 
topping of white hair and a long white 
beard. ‘Well, Swami,’ I began, ‘that is 
just what I do, not what I am.’ ‘Th en 
come and sit with me,’ he laughed 
uproariously.
I felt bonded with him from that 
moment. He helped me go deeper 
towards discovering who I am 
and to identify less with the role I 
played. Indeed, like his great Tamil 
contemporary, Ramana Maharshi 
of Arunachalam, in South India, 
Yogaswami used ‘Who am I?’ as a 
mantra and an existential question. 
He oft en chided me for running 
around the country, attending one 
offi  cial function aft er another, and 
neglecting the practice of sitting 
in meditation. When I got back to 
Ceylon from home leave in Canada, 
aft er visiting, on the way around 
the planet, France, Canada, Japan, 
Indonesia, and Cambodia, he sat me 
down fi rmly beside him and told me 
that I was spending my life energy 
uselessly, always looking outward for 
what could only be found within.
‘You are always running about, doing 
something, instead of sitting still and 
Sage of Jaffna!

Authored by: JAMES GEORGE, former Canadian High Commissioner 
to Sri Lanka, India, and Iran, a brilliant diplomat who was deeply 
infl uenced by Yogaswami, wrote this remarkable 1994 fi rst-person 
account of his experiences with Yogaswami, the Sage of Lanka who lived 
from 1872 to 1964. Th e following are his words.
just being. Why don’t you sit at home and confront yourself 
as you are, asking yourself, not me, “Who am I? Who am I? 
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?” ‘His voice 
rose in pitch, volume, and intensity with each repetition of 
the question until he screamed at me with all his force.
Th en suddenly, he was silent, very powerfully quiet, fi lling 
the room with his unspoken teaching that went far beyond 
words, banishing my turning thoughts with his simple 
presence. At that moment, I knew without question that 
I AM; that is enough; no ‘who’ needed. I just am. It is a 
lesson I keep having to relearn and re-experience, for the 
‘doing’ and the ‘thinking’ takes me over again and again as 
soon as I forget.
Another time, my wife and I brought our three children 
to see Yogaswami. Turning to the children, he asked them, 
‘How old are you?’ Our daughter said, ‘Nine,’ and the boys, 
‘Eleven’ and ‘Th irteen.’ To each in turn, Yogaswami replied 
solemnly, ‘I am the same age as you.’ When the children 
protested that he couldn’t be three diff erent ages at once 
and must be much older than their grandfather, Yogaswami 
just laughed and winked at us to see if we understood.
At the time, we took it as his joke with the children, but 
we slowly came to see that he meant something profound, 
which we could decipher. Now, I think this was his way of 
saying indirectly that although the body may be of very 
diff erent ages on its way from birth to death, something 
just as accurate as the body, and for which the body is only 
a vehicle, always was and always will be. In that sense, we 
are essentially all ‘the same age.’
Aft er I had met Yogaswami many times, I learned to 
prepare my questions carefully. One day, when I had done 
so, I approached his hut, took off  my shoes, went in, and sat 
down on a straw mat on the earth fl oor while he watched 
me with an attention that never seemed to fail him. ‘Swami,’ 
I began, ‘I think…’ ‘Already wrong!’ he thundered. And my 
mind again went into the nonconceptual state that he was 
such a master at invoking, clearing the way for being.
Th ough the state desired was thoughtless and wordless, 
he taught through a few favorite aphorisms in pithy 
expressions to be plumbed later in silence. Th ree of these 
aphorisms I shall report here: ‘Just be!’ or ‘Summa iru’ 
when he said it in Tamil. ‘Th ere is not even one thing 
wrong.’ ‘It is all perfect from the beginning.’ He applied 
these statements to the individual and to the cosmos. 
Order was a truth deeper than disorder. We don’t have to 
develop or do anything because, essentially, in our being, 
we are ideally in charge here and now, when we are here 
and now.
Looking at the world as it is now, thirty years aft er his 
death, I wonder if he would utter the same aphorisms with 
the same conviction today. I expect he would challenge us 
to go deeper to understand what he meant. Reality cannot 
be imperfect or wrong; only we can be wrong and evil 
when we are not real or now!
