F
or over 5,000 heart-wrenching days, the echoes 
of veteran cartoonist and journalist Prageeth 
Ekneligoda's disappearance have relentlessly 
resonated within the heart of his bereft  wife, 
Sandhya. Each day since that fateful January 24, 
2010, has been a testament to her unwavering 
resolve. With fervour, she has openly and 
persistently pointed to the Rajapaksa family as the 
architects of her husband's abduction.
Her relentless search for answers has seen her 
darkening the doorsteps of police stations, 
echoing her pleas in courtrooms, and reaching 
out to the international community at Th e Hague 
Tribunal. But 2022 marked a soul-stirring shift  
in her battle. Driven to despair, she discarded her 
white saree, the emblem of her mourning. In an 
act of profound symbolism, she shaved her head, 
invoking the ancient deities to bear witness to 
her pain, seeking their wrath against those who 
wronged her.
Th at very day, she proclaimed her battle anew. 
With the 'Naga Sandeshaya' (Th e Epistle of the 
Cobra) in hand, she made her way to the Modara 
Sri Maha Badra Kali Amman Kovil. Th is poignant 
‘Vas Kaviya’, seemingly an impassioned message 
from Goddess Pattini to the mighty Goddess 
Kali, called for obliterating the Rajapaksas and all 
complicit in Prageeth’s disappearance. Whether by 
divine design or sheer human momentum, a vast 
tide of public unrest surged against the Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa administration in the following months 
as citizens grappled with mounting crises.
And yet, amidst the tumult of politics and power 
games, stands Sandhya, a beacon of enduring love, 
her heart forever yearning for her lost husband.
