n the wake of the historic resumption of ferry services 
between India and Sri Lanka, numerous claims have 
surfaced, with various individuals and organizations from 
Jaff na seeking credit for making this cross-border maritime 
connection a reality. However, insiders and those familiar 
with the behind-the-scenes negotiations reveal that one of 
the driving forces behind this signifi cant initiative is the Sri 
Lankan Minister of Fisheries, Douglas Devananda.
Amidst the competing narratives and counterclaims 
surrounding the commencement of the ferry service, 
insiders with knowledge of the situation suggest that 
Douglas Devananda's dedication quietly but eff ectively 
infl uenced this signifi cant initiative. Sources indicate 
Devananda's involvement extended far beyond mere 
claims or casual support. He embarked on a relentless 
lobbying campaign that spanned the Indian and Sri Lankan 
governments. To further his cause, Minister Devananda 
made unique visits to Delhi on a few occasions, engaging 
directly with the high command of the Indian government. 
Th ese face-to-face interactions provided a platform for 
Devananda to elucidate the importance of reinstating the 
ferry service between the two nations. Sources further say 
Devananda's eff orts extended well beyond Indian shores. 
He engaged in intensive discussions with the Sri Lankan 
government, advocating for cooperation and support for 
this critical initiative. His diplomatic endeavours aimed 
to ensure that all stakeholders recognized the potential 
benefi ts of the ferry service for both nations.
