any of us have unique 
collecting habits. I know 
someone who amasses 
stamps, while another is passionate 
about collecting coins from various 
nations. My uncle takes pride in his 
collection of liquor bottles, ranging 
from DCSL Extra Special to the 
prestigious Johnnie Walker Blue. 
Th e extent of our collections oft en 
refl ects our fi nancial capabilities, 
doesn’t it? However, in Colombo, 
an individual’s collection went 
beyond the ordinary. He was not just 
passionate about cars, but specifi cally 
high-end Mercedes-Benz vehicles. 
His residence on Queens Road in 
Colombo was emblematic of this 
passion, featuring an expansive 
portico explicitly designed to protect 
and display his Mercedes-Benz 
collection. Th is selective collector 
was Mr. Gaasinather Gangaser 
Ponnambalam, commonly called 
Kumar Ponnambalam.
During a car exhibition at Colombo’s 
BMICH, the city’s elite showcased 
their prized vehicles. Amidst the 
display, a man kept returning, 
parking another luxurious car 
each time. Th is raised suspicions 
among the police. Could one person 
possess so many luxury cars? Th ey 
speculated he might be a car thief. 
However, upon questioning him, 
they discovered he was none other 
than Kumar Ponnambalam.
Th e Ponnambalam family is 
renowned as one of Sri Lanka’s 
wealthiest, if not in Asia. Kumar’s 
son, Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, 
president and an MP from the Tamil 
National People’s Front (TNPF), 
is widely considered one of the 
Country’s most affl  uent politicians. 
He inherited a substantial fortune 
from his family. Th anks to Kumar’s 
impressive collection of Benz cars, 
his son Gajendrakumar earned the 
nickname “Benz Gajendran.” Sources 
suggest that Gajendrakumar receives 
around ten crores monthly from 
rents on various properties he owns 
in Colombo.
I would not have felt compelled to 
write this if Gajendrakumar had 
simply focused on amassing wealth 
or enjoying his familial fortune. 
Th e issue arises when he begins 
radicalizing innocent Tamil youths 
for his politics. My concern deepens 
when he, driven by self-interest, 
opposes potentially benefi cial 
solutions like the 13th amendment 
and, in doing so, further radicalizes 
a new generation. Th e systematic 
activities of him and his political

party suggest a disturbing intent: a desire for further 
confl ict. Even in the shadow of the Mullivaikkal tragedy, 
his thirst for blood appears unquenched. Recent actions 
by his party lend weight to suspicions that he might be 
pursuing even more sinister agendas, reminiscent of a 
bloodthirsty giant from mythological tales.
TNPF’s Memorial Rally: A Provocative Strategy
Th e Tamil National People’s Front (TNPF), under the 
leadership of Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, orchestrated 
a memorial rally in honor of Th ileepan. Th ileepan, once 
the head of the LTTE’s political wing, is remembered for 
his intense hunger strike, where he abstained from food 
and water until his passing. Th is commemorative event 
featured a dedicated vehicle and spanned from Pottuvil, a 
town in the eastern Ampara District of Sri Lanka, all the 
way to Nallur, a village in the northern Jaff na region.
Th e distance from Pottuvil to Nallur is approximately 477 
km. Th is journey traverses several towns and villages with 
predominantly Sinhala and Muslim populations. Both 
communities hold deep-seated animosities towards the 
LTTE. While the Muslim community remained passive 
during the rally, tensions escalated in Kappalthurai, 
Trincomalee, where a Sinhala mob confronted and attacked 
the commemorative vehicle with stones and batons.
While Th ileepan’s unyielding determination during his 
fast unto death might have elevated him to a heroic status 
among Tamils, it’s challenging to see him being revered in 
the same light by Sinhala and Muslim communities that 
have been deeply aff ected by the LTTE’s violent actions. 
Th e rally appears to have been meticulously planned 
to provoke Sinhalese and Muslims. Routing it through 
areas predominantly inhabited by these two communities 
seemed like a calculated move, possibly anticipating and 
capitalizing on the expected confrontational reactions. 
Th e very design of this path might reveal its intent. While 
the Muslim community exhibited restraint in the face of 
these potential provocations, a section of the Sinhalese 
community responded.
Subsequently, the propaganda arm of the TNPF sprang 
into action. Fueled by substantial fi nancial backing 
from the Tamil diaspora, they launched an extensive 
indoctrination campaign on social media. Some Tamil-
language publications and journalists, dubiously labeled as 
‘neutral,’ also contributed to spreading this narrative. Th e 
propagated message rang loud and clear: ‘Th e Sinhalese 
attacked Th ileepan, who sacrifi ced his life for the Tamils 
without consuming even a single drop of water. Th e 
solution to this injustice? Rally behind TNPF and support 
them electorally and fi nancially,’ they proclaimed.
TNPF’s Propaganda and Echoes of LTTE
While most Tamils cautiously approached the TNPF’s 
propaganda, a segment of naive Tamil youths in their teens 
and 20s were swayed by its harmful indoctrination. Due 
to this skewed narrative, Th ese young individuals believed 
that the entire Sinhalese community was responsible 
for the attack on the memorial fl oat commemorating 
Th ileepan. Th ey overlooked the TNPF’s role in stoking the 
fl ames of confl ict.
Th e concern arises from the observation that the TNPF 
seems to adopt the same strategies that the LTTE once 
employed on the Tamil population. Th is approach appears 
systematic in its intent to infl uence perceptions and 
ideologies. Instead of fostering critical thinking within the 
younger generation, there is a clear push to adopt certain 
narratives without critical examination. Th is can instigate 
confl icts with other communities, escalating violence 
while portraying themselves as victims. It’s crucial to note 
the similarities in tactics between the TNPF and LTTE, 
particularly in how they engage with the youth.
As a Tamil who has personally witnessed the devastating 
civil war, I am acutely aware of the severe consequences the 
LTTE’s propaganda machine had on the Sri Lankan Tamil 
community. Th e misleading narratives and tactics LTTE 
employed brought unimaginable suff ering to our people.
Weaponizing the ‘Traitor’ Label
Th ere’s also growing concern regarding the tendency of 
TNPF to label those who disagree with them politically or 
ethically as ‘Traitors.’ Th is tactic mirrors the methods of 
the LTTE, who accused and killed countless Tamils under 
the same label. During the last confl ict, Tamils attempting 
to fl ee LTTE-controlled territories were labeled traitors 
and subsequently killed. Th ose challenging the force 
recruitments of the LTTE also faced similar fates. TNPF 
continues this troubling tradition of labeling. Almost every 
leader or individual, regardless of their political Stance, 
who challenges or questions the political machinations 
of the TNPF is deemed a traitor. Kanagaratnam Sugash, 
a prominent voice for TNPF, is notably quick to use this 
label. In the journalistic circle, there was a joke: Sugas once 
labeled a biryani vendor a ‘national betrayer ‘just because 
he failed to give him the desired leg piece.
A Dangerous Blend: Narcotics and Politics in Jaffna
Jaff na is increasingly gaining notoriety as a hub for 
narcotics. A range of substances, from heroin to crystal 
methamphetamine (commonly known as “ice”), codeine, 
and even cannabis (oft en referred to as “ganja”), can be

readily found in the area. Alarmingly, a small portion of 
its youth, including school-going children, is succumbing 
to addiction due to the unchecked fl ow of drugs within 
the region. A recent report that particularly disturbed 
many parents in Jaff na was the arrest of schoolgirls in 
possession of heroin. Th e idea of students indulging in 
such substances just a few years ago would have been 
unthinkable.
Some experts believe this trend isn’t accidental but a 
deliberate targeting of the younger generation. While 
many drug distributors have been apprehended, their 
release oft en follows shortly aft er. Why? Prominent legal 
advocates, directly or indirectly associated with the TNPF, 
have represented these individuals, facilitating their 
escape. Th is questionable allegiance of some advocates 
who claim to champion Tamil nationalism is drawing 
criticism. Th ere’s widespread talk in Jaff na about a leading 
TNPF-affi  liated lawyer who consistently represents drug 
off enders. Rumors also suggest that the earnings from 
representing these criminals enabled him to buy prime real 
estate in the heart of Colombo. Numerous respected Jaff na 
fi gures have publicly pleaded with these lawyers to refrain 
from representing drug-related cases, but to little avail. 
Drug peddlers in Jaff na operate with a sense of impunity, 
confi dent that they have a solid legal support system ready 
to back them.
Adding another layer to the complexity of the drug issue 
in Jaff na is the alleged misuse of these vulnerable drug-
addicted youth by certain factions within the TNPF. 
Th ere are claims that these “Tamil nationalists” exploit the 
situation by leveraging these impressionable youths for 
their agendas, mainly to enforce their infl uence or quell 
dissent.
Reports suggest that those who oppose or criticize the 
TNPF might be at odds with these manipulated youths, 
who are dispatched to ‘set things straight.’ Such tactics, 
if true, have grave implications. In examining the surge 
in violent incidents, particularly the so-called “sword 
violence,” fi ngers increasingly point towards this unholy 
alliance. Such developments underscore a dangerous blend 
of narcotics and politics, further destabilizing a vulnerable 
community.
TNPF’s Stance on the 13th Amendment: 
Inconsistencies and Contradictions
Th e 13th Amendment in Sri Lanka has sparked varied 
reactions within Tamil political groups since its 
introduction in 1987. Intended as a remedy to address 
the grievances of the Tamil minority by providing some 
degree of autonomy to provinces, its reception has been 
mixed. Politicians like Douglas Devananda see the 
amendment as a positive step forward. On the other hand, 
Sampanthan, the leader of the Tamil National Alliance, 
had famously remarked that he wouldn’t even touch 
the amendment with a broomstick. As time passed, he 
began to acknowledge its potential importance. However, 
TNPF, under Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam’s leadership, 
staunchly opposes it, going so far as to label its supporters 
as “traitors.”
TNPF opposes the 13th Amendment act from its amused 
“Two Nations in One Country” ideology. Frankly, I 
don’t know if Gajendrakumar himself fully grasps its 
meaning. Th e core issue is the seeming contradiction 
between TNPF’s “Two Nations in One Country” 
ideology and its participation in general elections, which 
implies recognizing Sri Lanka as a singular entity. If 
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam and the TNPF truly 
support this “Two Nations” concept, their electoral 
involvement within the Sri Lankan framework appears 
inconsistent.
An open-minded observer might think the TNPF is just 
clowning around, wondering if they’re even in the big 
league. But dismissing them as mere political jokers would 
be a grave oversight. Th eir deliberate tactics targeting 
the youth and provocations toward other ethnicities 
require thorough examination. Th e substantial fi nancial 
backing they allegedly secure from the diaspora should 
not be taken lightly. Given the Tamil community’s history 
marred by three tumultuous decades of confl ict, vigilance 
against emerging threats, notably the TNPF, is paramount. 
Equally important is the Sri Lankan government’s role 
in meticulously monitoring diaspora fund transfers and 
investigating any unsubstantiated allegations of illicit ties 
with the TNPF. Complacency is not an option.

O
n September 5, 2023, the esteemed 
British broadcasting entity 
Channel 4 unveiled an investigative 
documentary titled “Sri Lanka’s Easter 
Bombings.” Th is fi lm has cast a profound 
shadow over Sri Lanka’s political landscape. 
Th e documentary postulates the direct 
complicity of several Sri Lankan political 
fi gures in the harrowing Easter bombings 
in 2019. Central to these allegations is 
the implication that the Rajapaksa family 
masterminded the attacks to orchestrate a 
political shift  in power.
Th e documentary draws its conclusions 
from the testimonies of three pivotal 
informants:
Hanzeer Azad Maulana, a former confi dant 
of Sivanesathurai Chanthirakanthan, also 
known as Pillaiyaan, the leader of the Tamil 
Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP). 
Chanthirakanthan currently presides as the 
State Minister for Rural Road Transport.
 Nishantha Silva, an ex-police offi  cer, earned 
accolades for his rigorous probe into the 
mysterious death of journalist Lasantha 
Wickrematunge. His investigation led him 
to a comprehensive interview with Mr 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Given the sensitive nature of the revelations, 
a senior Sri Lankan government offi  cial 
chose to provide his insights under the 
cloak of anonymity, abstaining from any on-
screen appearance.
While each informant brought unique 
insights, Hanzeer Azad Maulana stood out. 
His damning allegations, especially those 
levelled against prominent fi gures like the 
former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa,

Director of State Intelligence Suresh Sallay, and Minister 
Pillaiyaan, served as the linchpin for the documentary’s 
narrative. Th ese testimonies accentuated the documentary’s 
eff orts to unravel the complex nexus underpinning the 
tragic bombings.
Channel 4’s claims largely stem from the statements of 
Azad Maulana, a former liaison offi  cer to Chandrakanthan, 
also known as “Pillayan.” Th e latter, once the Chief 
Minister of the Eastern Province, currently serves as an MP 
and State Minister.
Azad Maulana, born initially as Muhammad Mihilar 
Muhammad Hanseer, is a native of the Maruthamunai 
village situated in the Kalmunai Ampara district. He carries 
a signifi cant lineage; his father was deeply entrenched in 
the Tamil Eelam Liberation struggle. Recognized by the 
nom de guerre ‘Kamalan Th ozar,’ Maulana’s father was a 
seasoned Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front 
(EPRLF) militant. He also held the esteemed position of 
a personal bodyguard for the organization’s paramount 
leader, Padmanabha. However, tragedy struck on June 19, 
1990, when the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
executed a strategic assault in Chennai’s Kodambakkam 
locale. Th is assault resulted in the unfortunate demise of 
several key EPRLF fi gures, including Kamalan Th ozar.
Kamalan Th ozar was the father of four children: two 
daughters and two sons. His eldest son, Hanzeer, born 
in 1983, was a mere seven years old when tragedy struck 
and he lost his father. Following this loss, the family faced 
tremendous fi nancial hardships. As time passed and the 
family sought a sense of normalcy, Hanzeer’s mother 
eventually remarried.
Bearing the weight of personal loss, Azad Maulana 
harboured deep-seated resentment towards the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), oft en called the ‘Tigers.’ 
One of his close relatives echoed this sentiment: “Given 
that his father was mercilessly killed by the LTTE, it’s only 
natural for Azad to feel a profound anger towards the 
‘Tigers’.”
Azad Maulana demonstrated academic prowess early 
and studied at the Maruthamunai Shams Madhya Maha 
Vidyalaya, according to one of his former teachers who 
commended him for his academic excellence. Pursuing 
bio-science at the Advanced Level (AL), Maulana achieved 
commendable scores that secured his enrollment at the 
Sri Lanka School of Agriculture in Kundasale, Kandy. 
However, there are contrasting accounts regarding his 
educational journey aft er that. While some contend that he 
discontinued his studies aft er a mere year, others assert that 
he eventually returned to the institution and completed his 
academic pursuits. During his university years, Hanseer 
assisted Gunasekaram Shankar (a former EPRLF militant), 
an MP for the EPDP at the time. 
In a pivotal 2004 schism, the dominant Tamil militant 
group LTTE experienced an internal revolt. Its Eastern 
regional commander, Vinayagamoorthy Muraleetharan, 
more commonly recognized as Col. Karuna, openly 
challenged the authority of LTTE’s paramount leader, 
Veluppillai Prabhakaran. Th is insurrection resulted in a 
pronounced division within the LTTE’s organizational 
framework.
Emerging from this rift , the LTTE Karuna faction, as it was 
initially termed, shift ed its allegiances to collaborate with 
the Sri Lankan Government. Th is partnership extended to 
the nation’s military and intelligence sectors. Empowered 
by state support, the Karuna faction confronted the 
LTTE, focusing primarily on the Eastern territories of 
Sri Lanka. In this new power structure, Karuna’s deputy, 
Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, known more widely as 
Pillaiyan, ascended as the commanding fi gure in Batticaloa.
Parallel to these military developments, a political off shoot 
took form as the Tamil Eelam Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal 
(TEMVP). Over time, the party rebranded, adopting 
Th amil Makkal Viduthalaip Puligal (TMVP). Amidst the 
backdrop of confl ict and shift ing allegiances, this political 
establishment emerged as a central player in the Eastern 
region’s evolving geopolitical landscape.
By 2006, the Eastern Tigers faction required a suitable 
representative to support their spokesperson, Uruthira 
Master, also known as ‘Th ooyavan.’ Recognizing Hanseer’s 
background and potential advantages (given his personal 
loss at the hands of the LTTE and his Muslim identity), 
Pillaiyan entrusted him with the responsibility. Th e hope 
was that Hanseer’s heritage would cement his loyalty 
against the LTTE, and his religious identity might off er 
him protection from the Tigers’ hostilities. Within the 
organization, he was given the name ‘Suhanthan,’ while 
externally, he was referred to as ‘Azad Maulana’—both 
names bestowed upon him by Pillaiyan. 
Th e Eastern Tigers methodically and successfully drove the 
Northern Tigers, also known as the Vanni Tigers, out of the 
Eastern Province. By July 11, 2007, the Eastern Province 
was offi  cially declared free from the Vanni Tigers.
Concurrently, the Eastern Tigers initiated the publication 
of a magazine named ‘Tamil Alai.’ Azad Maulana 
contributed numerous articles to this magazine, writing 
under the pseudonym ‘Uttaman.’ During this period, Azad 
Maulana wedded a woman named ‘Noskia,’ who was born 
in Colombo and raised in Panadura.

In 2008, the Eastern Tigers pivoted to politics, registering 
as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (Tamil Peoples 
Liberation Tigers) for the Eastern Provincial Council 
elections on May 10. Th e 37-seat council saw UPFA 
win 20 seats, UNP 15, and JVP and another Tamil party 
one each. Contesting under the UPFA’s banner, TMVP’s 
Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, or “Pillaiyan,” garnered 
an impressive 41,936 votes from Batticaloa, subsequently 
becoming Chief Minister. Acknowledging Azad Maulana’s 
loyalty, Pillaiyan appointed him as a coordinator. Th eir 
close alliance lasted until 2021.
second marriage
Azad Maulana, already wedded to Noskia, with whom he 
has two children, deceitfully entered another matrimonial 
bond. He falsely claimed to have separated from his fi rst 
wife and went on to marry a woman named Benaseer from 
his neighbouring village of Sainthamaruthu. Benazir is an 
English teacher by profession. On 27/09/2021, Maulana’s 
engagement to Benazir was celebrated with a grand Valima 
feast at the Rivera Resort Hotel in Batticaloa. Aft er the 
meeting, on 28/09/2021, Azad Maulana formally registered 
his marriage at the ‘Al-Majjitul Huda Bazar Mosque located 
in Wangamam Village, Amparai District.
Following his second marriage, Azad Maulana’s personal 
life was plunged into turmoil. His fi rst wife mounted a 
fi erce protest, and the families of both wives confronted 
him with signifi cant challenges. Both factions sought 
intervention from Pillaiyan. To shield himself from the 
ensuing chaos, Azad Maulana appealed to Pillaiyan for 
protection. However, Pillaiyan maintained a stance of 
neutrality, suggesting that the matter was beyond his 
infl uence, and advised all parties involved to seek legal 
counsel. He emphasized that Azad Maulana should submit 
himself to the course of justice.
Stripped of Pillaiyan’s support, Azad Maulana found 
himself at the mercy of the angered family members of his 
fi rst wife, who physically assaulted him. Th e police began 
to closely monitor his activities, intensifying their scrutiny. 
Further, on 30/01/2022, his second wife lodged a complaint 
against him (Complaint No. CIB 153/263) over the 
deceptive marriage at the Sainthamaruthu Police Station. 
Th e ensuing events rendered Azad Maulana’s personal life 
tumultuous and deeply distressing. She further escalated 
the matter by lodging a complaint with the Ampara CID 
alleging Azad Maulana had forged government documents. 
With no viable alternatives, Azad Maulana boarded a plane 
bound for India.
Upon reaching Paris from India in June 2022, Azad 
Maulana travelled to Switzerland for political asylum. 
However, his request was declined, leading to his 
deportation to France, where his asylum plea was similarly 
turned down.
In light of these events, Azad Maulana stepped into the 
spotlight, providing an interview to Channel 4 in which he 
professed knowledge of the intricate details surrounding 
the Easter bombings. His narrative garnered considerable 
attention internationally. However, ironically, those 
acquainted with Maulana locally exhibited scepticism. 
Many dismissed his testimony relatively lightly, suggesting 
it was merely a strategy to secure asylum in a European 
country.
