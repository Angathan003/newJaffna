Monitor Memo
M
inister of Transport, Highways, Ports, 
and Civil Aviation, Bimal Rathnayake, 
has announced that Palaly Airport in Jaffna 
will be officially elevated to the status of a 
fully functioning international airport by 
September 30, 2025.
Speaking to Jaffna-based journalists during 
an inspection tour of the airport earlier this 
month, the Minister set a firm deadline and 
assured—in a mix of Sinhala and Tamil—
“Appi poi ille – this time, it’s not a lie,” directly 
addressing the long-standing frustrations of 
Northern residents over a string of unfulfilled 
promises by successive governments.
“This is not like the previous administrations 
that made empty pledges. This time, we are 
serious” he emphasized.
Just days before the Minister’s visit, Jaffna 
Monitor, in its editorial, highlighted the urgent 
need for reliable international air connectivity 
in the region. Jaffna Monitor also learned 
that weeks ahead of the Minister’s arrival, a 
powerful civil society group named IMPACT 
(Interdisciplinary Multifaceted Professionals 
for Active Community Transformations)—
comprising leading figures from Jaffna—met 
with influential members of the National 
People’s Power (NPP) in Jaffna to advocate for 
the full-fledged development of the airport.
Minister Rathnayake was accompanied on 
his visit by senior officials and NPP members, 
including Fisheries Minister Ramalingam 
Chandrasekar and Jaffna MPs Ilangkumaran 
and Sripavanandarajah. The delegation held 
on-site discussions with aviation engineers, 
airport officials, and technical experts to assess 
current capabilities and identify necessary 
upgrades.
The Minister noted that the existing 
infrastructure at Palaly already meets several 
key international standards. He further 
emphasized the government’s intention 
to amend aviation laws to permit greater 
‘Appi poi ille’:
Jaffna Airport to Become

flexibility for domestic and private airline 
operators to utilize the airport—aiming to 
boost tourism, investment, and regional 
access.
“At present, Jaffna residents must rely solely 
on the Katunayake Airport for international 
travel, despite having an airport in their own 
region. That must change. With appropriate 
legal reforms, even private aircraft owners will 
be able to operate flights to and from Jaffna—
serving public needs and business interests 
alike,” he stated.
The transformation of Palaly Airport into 
a fully operational international hub is 
widely regarded as a crucial move toward 
reconnecting the Northern Province—still 
recovering from the aftermath of decades of 
conflict—with the rest of the country and the 
global community. The initiative is expected 
to invigorate the regional economy, facilitate 
diaspora engagement, enhance accessibility, 
and strengthen national integration.
Whether this turns out to be appi poi ille (not 
a lie) or simply appi poi (just another lie), only 
time will tell.
T
he National People’s Power 
(NPP) mayoral candidate for 
Jaffna, Dr. Kapilan, is under fire 
amid allegations of abandoning 
key academic responsibilities at the 
University of Jaffna’s Faculty of Arts.
Once a senior lecturer, now 
suddenly a politician, Dr. Kapilan 
is accused of vanishing from 
academia mid-semester—leaving 
behind unchecked exam scripts, unfinished 
lectures, and abandoned research supervision, 
much to the frustration of students and faculty 
alike.
“For more than six months, papers remained 
unchecked, and students were left in limbo,” 
said a faculty member who wished to remain 
anonymous. Final-year students have 
reportedly suffered the most due to incomplete 
research supervision and halted coursework.
Adding fuel to the controversy is that Kapilan 
had previously been on paid academic leave 
for postgraduate studies. Critics argue that 
after benefiting from public 
resources, his sudden departure has 
left both students and colleagues in 
disarray.
“It’s about accountability,” said a 
student leader in a conversation 
with Jaffna Monitor. “He has every 
right to enter politics, but he should 
have completed the academic duties 
he promised. Leaving unfinished 
work behind to chase a big opportunity is 
nothing short of betrayal.”
"Whether he wins or loses is secondary," 
added another academic. "What matters is the 
precedent being set. Can someone who walked 
away from their duty as a teacher be trusted to 
serve the public?"
With public scrutiny mounting, the spotlight 
now falls on whether Dr. Kapilan—or his 
NPP leadership—will address these concerns, 
or continue to let silence speak for them, as 
many in Jaffna accuse the NPP of doing since 
coming to power.
