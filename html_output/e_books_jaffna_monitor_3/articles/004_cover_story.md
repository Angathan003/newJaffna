operate discreetly across the country, given 
the controversies and serious criminal charges 
associated with him.
Despite his notoriety, Nithyananda has 
attracted a significant number of devotees in Sri 
Lanka—primarily from Tamil-speaking areas. 
However, his following is not as widespread 
as that of another controversial figure, the late 
Swami Premananda, who was also accused 
of rape and was known to be the spiritual 
guru of C.V. Wigneswaran, the former Chief 
Minister of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. 
Wigneswaran continues to organize Guru Pooja 
ceremonies annually on Premananda’s death 
anniversary—despite the fact that Premananda 
was a convicted rapist and molester.
Nithyananda’s influence is such that a few 
Tamils, who are among his most ardent 
devotees, shared accounts of supposed 
miraculous healings with Jaffna Monitor. 
One woman said she had resolved her long-
standing migraine problem many years 
ago after invoking him. Another man from 
Batticaloa, who wished to remain anonymous, 
claimed that the ‘miracle godman’ healed 
his mother’s chronic health issue through a 
Zoom call. However, Jaffna Monitor could not 
independently verify these extraordinary claims 
from a medical standpoint.
More than in Sri Lanka itself, Nithyananda 
seems to have infiltrated the Sri Lankan Tamil 
diaspora communities abroad—particularly 
in Canada—on a surprisingly deep level. He 
has managed to attract a significant following 
among Sri Lankan Tamils, with many even 
joining his cult and becoming sannyasis 
(renunciates). 
 
For instance, a woman of Jaffna origin and a 
Canadian citizen adopted the name Kailasa's 
Nithya Premaroopananda, while a Jaffna-
born man named Umesh became Sri Nithya 
Omkarananda. These are just a couple of 
examples. According to sources, hundreds of 
Sri Lankan diaspora members have joined the 
cult as sannyasis, while thousands more have 
become die-hard followers—mesmerized by 
Nithyananda’s teachings, sugar-coated sermons, 
theatrical flair, or perhaps simply the promise 
of a spiritual utopia in an imaginary nation.
When the noose tightened around him 
following multiple rape allegations by former 
female disciples and a child abduction case 
involving two sisters who refused to return 
home from his ashram, Nithyananda vanished 
from India in 2019. He later re-emerged with 
perhaps the most brazen claim ever made by 
a self-styled godman: that he had founded a 
sovereign Hindu nation—the “United States of 
Kailasa” (USK), or simply, Kailasa.
This so-called nation, first declared in 
December 2019 by Nithyananda and his band 
of devout (and deluded?) followers—who claim 
it actually has real, physical territory. For many 
Sri Lankan Tamils—who spent nearly three 
decades fighting, bleeding, and dreaming of 
an independent state—the idea was, at first 
glance, nothing short of surreal. A few were 
even overheard muttering, half in jest and half 
in disbelief, that the Swami—godman, conman 
or cosmic prankster—had pulled off what even 
the mighty Prabhakaran, hailed by his hardcore 
fans as an avatar of Lord Murugan, and the 
LTTE couldn’t manage.
Interestingly, Nithyananda even sought 
political asylum in Sri Lanka in 2022. Citing 
deteriorating health, the fugitive godman 
wrote a letter to the then President of Sri Lanka 
on 7 August 2022, requesting protection. 
Unsurprisingly, no one paid attention to his 
appeal.
While all this was unfolding, Indian law 
enforcement issued a Blue Notice via Interpol 
to help locate him. The Indian government 
went as far as canceling his passport and

warning foreign governments not to grant him 
entry. But Nithyananda had already vanished—
slipping into a fog of speculation since 2019. To 
this day, nobody really knows where he is.
But Nithyananda is hardly stoppable. Clad in 
ornate attire resembling depictions of Lord 
Shiva—adorned with multiple rudraksha beads 
and his signature Jada Mudi (long matted 
hair)—he continues to appear regularly in 
online videos. In these broadcasts, he delivers 
sermons, answers questions from his devotees, 
mocks his critics, and even challenges Indian 
authorities with taunts like, “Catch me if you 
can.”
In one such session, he even blessed the 
controversial Jaffna MP, Ramanathan 
Archchuna, at the request of a devotee. 
However, he made it clear that, as the “Supreme 
Pontiff of Hinduism,” he would not take any 
political stance.
Wait... what? Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism? 
Yes, you read that right—Nithyananda doesn’t 
just style himself as the head of Kailasa; he has 
also grandiosely declared himself the “Supreme 
Pontiff of Hinduism.” And he hasn’t stopped 
there. According to him, his country has a 
population of two billion. How did he arrive 
at that number? Simple mathematics—by 
counting every Hindu in the world as a citizen 
of Kailasa.
In the early years following his Houdini-style 
disappearance, Nithyananda and his loyal band 
of followers cleverly and systematically spread 
the tale that Kailasa had been established on 
a private island off the coast of Ecuador. They 
even released a step-by-step travel itinerary to 
reach this mythical land—the first step, rather 
bizarrely, was to go to Australia.
However, the Ecuadorian government was

quick to pour cold water on the fantasy, 
firmly stating that Nithyananda had neither 
been granted asylum nor acquired any such 
land within their borders.
Yet, despite having no actual land or 
a shred of international recognition, 
Kailasa is promoted by Nithyananda as 
the world's only "sovereign Hindu nation" 
and a sanctuary for persecuted Hindus. 
When asked why he was so determined to 
establish a separate country, he once said, 
“I am the Head, the Supreme Pontiff, and 
the Supreme Leader of this nation. You can’t 
charge me here with cases.” A not-so-subtle 
nod to the multiple criminal charges still 
haunting him back in India.
But who can stop Nithyananda?
To lend Kailasa the appearance of a 
functioning state, Nithyananda has 
created an elaborate web of websites, 
social media channels, and NGOs. He 
has bestowed grandiose titles on his most 
trusted disciples, such as “Prime Minister,” 
“Ambassador,” and “Foreign Minister.” 
Through calculated deception—at which 
Nithyananda has proven himself a 
master—he and his followers have managed to 
infiltrate global institutions and even persuade 
a few governments, many of which became 
laughingstocks and subjects of ridicule.
In 2023, Kailasa’s self-declared “Permanent 
Ambassador to the UN,” Vijayapriya 
Nithyananda, delivered a statement during 
a UN committee session in Geneva. The 
stunt prompted the UN to issue a rare 
clarification, clearly stating that Kailasa is not 
recognized and that any submissions from its 
representatives would be disregarded.
That same year, the city of Newark, New Jersey, 
USA, signed a laughable sister-city agreement 
with Kailasa, under the mistaken belief that 
it was a legitimate sovereign nation. Days 
later, the agreement was voided and a public 
apology was issued, with officials admitting 
that no due diligence had been conducted. As 
U.S. newspapers sarcastically noted, “No due 
diligence” is one thing—but the authorities 
hadn’t even performed a basic Google search.
Reports suggest that similar approaches were 
made to more than two dozen municipalities 
across the United States, particularly targeting 
smaller towns. Some of these towns even issued 
symbolic “Kailasa Day” proclamations—only 
to later discover they had been misled by 
representatives of a non-existent country.
In 2022, the scam reached Paraguay, where 
Kailasa operatives managed to secure a

cooperation agreement with the Ministry of 
Agriculture. Once the deception was exposed, 
the official involved was dismissed, and the 
government formally retracted the agreement.
But Nithyananda’s quest for territory didn’t end 
there. His loyal inner circle—more accurately, 
his most trusted and well-trained disciples—
recently attempted to carve out a separate 
state within Bolivia, the South American 
nation. There, Kailasa’s operatives struck a 
dubious 1,000-year land lease deal with certain 
indigenous communities, aiming to acquire 
nearly half a million hectares of Amazonian 
forest. The move marked one of the boldest 
and most bizarre attempts yet to secure actual 
territory for a nation that exists only in the 
minds of its believers.
The Bolivian Fantasy: How Kailasa 
Nearly Carved Out a Kingdom in the 
Amazon
In late 2024, the fugitive godman—still on 
the run and relentlessly chasing his fantastical 
dream of founding a nation where he could 
reign as the "Supreme Pontiff"—took his bizarre 
quest to the heart of Bolivia, a South American 
country known for its vast rainforests, cultural 
complexity, and strong indigenous autonomies.
What followed was perhaps the boldest, most 
surreal, and unintentionally comical chapter in 
the grand charade of Kailasa—and arguably in 
the wider theatre of self-styled godmen around 
the world.

Masquerading as emissaries of a legitimate 
state Nithyananda’s hand-picked conmen and 
conwomen, began negotiating with Indigenous 
communities in Bolivia’s Amazonian lowlands. 
They promised wealth, development, 
environmental protection (tapping into the 
locals’ deep reverence for nature), international 
recognition, and pretty much anything else 
under the sun.
To forge an emotional connection with 
Indigenous leaders, they made a claim even 
more bizarre than the idea of creating an 
independent Hindu nation: they insisted that 
their leader, Nithyananda, was a descendant 
of the 'persecuted' Saiva Vellalar tribe of South 
India. Many of his disciples were also presented 
as oppressed members of the same community. 
This narrative was carefully crafted to tap 
into specific provisions in Bolivia’s Political 
Constitution, which grants Indigenous peoples 
the right to self-governance and autonomy over 
vast territories.
For readers in Sri Lanka and India, this 
claim was nothing short of absurd—Saiva 
Vellalars are, in fact, a dominant, land-owning 
caste group that has historically never faced 
persecution. If anything, they were the ones 
calling the shots. Yet, astonishingly, Bolivia’s 
indigenous leaders accepted the story without 
batting an eye. And thus, these leaders ended 
up signing what can only be described as one of 
the most bizarre deals in modern history.
By November 2024, Kailasa’s envoys had 
secured signatures on secret agreements 
with indigenous leaders in Bolivia. In total, 
approximately 480,000 hectares—an area more 
than six times the size of the Jaffna District—
were promised to a "nation" that doesn’t even 
exist on any official map. But it wasn’t just the 
scale that was shocking. The fine print revealed 
that Kailasa would be granted exclusive rights 
over the land’s natural resources: minerals, 
water, timber—and not stopping there—

even the airspace above. According to the 
documents, Kailasa’s laws would apply 
within these designated zones. Its currency 
would be legal tender. Its passports would 
be recognized alongside Bolivian ones. 
These agreements contained audacious and 
calculated blueprints for a state within a 
state.
The most outrageous clause? The lease 
duration itself: “This lease is for a period 
of one thousand (1000) years, to be 
renewed automatically and perpetually,” the 
agreement reads. In practical terms, this 
wasn’t a lease at all—it was a quiet, near-
irrevocable land transfer cloaked in legalese.
Now a logical question arises: Why would 
anyone agree to such terms? The answer, 
at least partially, lies in the desperation 
and hope of the indigenous communities. 
According to later testimonies, Kailasa’s 
delegates dangled promises of prosperity 
and self-reliance—offering visions of 
healthcare, schools, roads, and clean 
water.“They promised us humanitarian help 
in health, education, roads, and potable 
water—things we lack,” said Pedro Guasico, 
a leader of the Baure community. “We were 
tricked.”
However, a few Bolivian sources later 
debunked this narrative. While it’s true that 
many Indigenous communities face serious 
challenges, some observers argue that the 
leaders who signed the deal may have had 
other motivations. After all, this fake godman is 
notorious for using lavish gifts—money, and at 
times even women—to win favor and influence 
decision-makers.
The deals remained hidden for months—until 
a brave journalist, Silvana Vincenti, a seasoned 
investigative reporter with El Deber, one of 
Bolivia’s most respected newspapers, exposed 
the entire affair, triggering both national and 
international outrage. Known for her relentless 
environmental reporting, she meticulously 
pieced together the story after days of rigorous 
on-the-ground investigation. The article hit 
like a thunderclap. The phrase “mil años”—a 
thousand years—leapt from headlines and 
echoed across Bolivia.
Thanks to her courageous reporting, what 
could have quietly become an annexation of 
ancestral land under the guise of spiritual 
kinship was brought into the daylight.
In this issue of Jaffna Monitor, we are proud 
to feature Silvana Vincenti's first exclusive 
interview with an Asian publication. In a wide-
ranging and in-depth conversation, Vincenti 
walks us through her investigation, the risks 
she took, and what the story reveals about the 
complex intersection of faith and fraud.
