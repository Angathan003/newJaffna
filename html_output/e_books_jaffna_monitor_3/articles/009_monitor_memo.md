Monitor Memo
W
hile our Tamil parliamentarians from 
Jaffna are busy engaging in hair-pulling 
political brawls—almost as if they're auditioning 
for a village tournament—former Sri Lankan 
cricket captain and current national team coach 
Sanath Jayasuriya, who was once dismissed by 
our Tamil nationalist leaders for his closeness to 
former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has quietly 
hit a diplomatic six out of the stadium—one that 
could change the sporting history of Jaffna and Sri 
Lankan Tamils.
Straight Drive to Modi: Jayasuriya 
Bats for an International Cricket 
Stadium in Jaffna
During Indian Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi’s recent visit to Colombo, 
Jayasuriya stepped up to the crease—
as he always does to smash a massive 
six—and made a direct appeal: he 
requested India’s support for building 
an international cricket stadium in 
Jaffna. If this materializes, it could 
rewrite the sporting narrative of Jaffna, 
while fostering reconciliation, youth 
empowerment, and national unity.

The request was made during a special meeting 
between Prime Minister Modi and members of Sri 
Lanka’s iconic 1996 Cricket World Cup-winning 
team, including Aravinda de Silva, Chaminda 
Vaas, Marvan Atapattu, Kumara Dharmasena, 
Upul Chandana, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Ravindra 
Pushpakumara, and Sanath Jayasuriya himself.
Speaking during the interaction, Jayasuriya said: 
“As the coach of the Sri Lankan team, we play 
matches across the country—but not in Jaffna. 
If India could assist in building an international 
cricket stadium there, it would be a tremendous 
boost for the youth of the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces. It would bring them closer to the 
national cricketing fold and help unify our nation 
through sport.”
In response, Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed his 
support, saying, “Your idea of hosting international 
matches in Jaffna is powerful. I assure you, my 
team will do everything possible to support it.”
The meeting also featured warm reminiscences 
of Sri Lanka’s 1996 World Cup campaign, with 
Prime Minister Modi describing the team as early 
adopters of the modern T20-style aggressive 
gameplay—a likely nod to the fearless opening duo 
of Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana, 
who tried to smash every ball over the boundary 
and pile up massive runs within the initial overs. 
As one sports writer once put it, they batted like 
every match was about to end in the next over… 
or like they’d just gotten a text from their girlfriend 
saying, “Babe, my parents aren’t home.”
Later, speaking to the media, Jayasuriya described 
the meeting as “inspiring,” saying: “We spoke about 
cricket—past, present, and future—and also about 
how Sri Lanka could progress like India. It was a 
great experience.”
If realized, the international stadium in Jaffna 
could well stand as a symbol of national healing 
and regional collaboration. And who knows—
maybe one day it will produce a world-class 
cricketer from Jaffna, someone like Sanath 
Sanath Jayasuriya in Jaffna: After meeting Indian 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sanath Jayasuriya, 
together with Sri Lanka’s Sports Minister Sunil 
Gamage, visited the proposed site for the Jaffna 
International Cricket Stadium in Mandaitheevu. He 
met Northern coaches and talent scouts, expressing his 
hope to one day see a cricketer from the North proudly 
represent Sri Lanka. “We’re committed to supporting 
the game’s growth in the region,” he said, noting the 
encouraging presence of Northern youth in the Sri 
Lanka U-19 setup.
Jayasuriya, who in turn might meet 
a future Prime Minister of India and 
request a sporting facility in a rural 
Sinhala village.
If sport can’t unite a nation that has been 
torn apart, what else can?=
