Monitor Memo
Q
uestions are mounting over alleged 
nepotism involving Rajeevan 
Jeyachandramoorthy, the National People’s 
Power (NPP) Member of Parliament for the 
Jaffna District, just months after his election 
on the party’s much-publicized platform of 
systemic change.
Rajeevan, a former loyalist of the Illankai 
Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) and once a close 
associate of M.A. Sumanthiran, joined the 
NPP shortly before the 2024 general elections. 
He secured a parliamentary seat riding the 
wave of popular support generated by the 
NPP’s promise of a corruption-free country 
and the charisma of its leader, Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake—what many have dubbed the 
“Anura Wave.”
However, since assuming office, Rajeevan has 
come under fire from his own constituents, 
rival parties, and civil society groups for 
allegedly prioritizing his own family members 
in public appointments—drawing a sharp 
contrast to the NPP’s pledge to dismantle 
entrenched political patronage networks.
According to credible reports: His father is 
contesting the upcoming Vellani Pradeshiya 
Sabha election as an NPP candidate. His 
mother, wife, and son-in-law have all been 
appointed Justices of the Peace (JPs) after he

became an MP. His nephew has also been 
appointed a JP, despite questions over whether 
he meets the minimum age requirement of 
30—raising concerns about eligibility and 
procedural integrity.
Locals who voted for the NPP hoping to 
break away from entrenched political culture 
are now voicing their disappointment. “This 
isn’t the change we were promised. We voted 
to clean up the system, not to watch a new 
family tree grow inside it,” said a Jaffna-based 
teacher who voted for the NPP in both the 
last presidential and parliamentary elections, 
speaking to Jaffna Monitor.
Political observers warn that Rajeevan’s rapid 
elevation of family members could seriously 
undermine the credibility of the NPP in the 
North, where the party made historic inroads 
by appealing to younger voters and those 
disillusioned with traditional Tamil parties. 
Despite the growing controversy, the NPP 
leadership has yet to issue a public response.
Meanwhile, political analysts and civil 
society activists are urging Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake to take a clear stand. “This was 
supposed to be a moment for a new kind 
of politics,” said one activist. “Instead, we’re 
seeing the same old patterns—just dressed up 
in the name of change.”
In an attempt to assert that his wife would 
not enter politics, Rajeevan took to Facebook 
and declared: 'vdJ kidtp kA+upf;fh 
xU NghJk; murpaYf;F tukhl;lhu;. ahu; 
mioj;jhYk; ehd; tplkhl;Nld;." (“My wife 
Mayurika will never enter politics. No matter 
who calls her, I will not allow it.”) But instead 
of putting an end to the controversy, his post 
sparked a fresh wave of criticism.
Social media users slammed the MP, asking, 
“Who are you to stop her? Are you practicing 
blatant male dominance in the name of 
politics?”
Even Tamil poet Karunakaran weighed in with 
a public comment, saying:
“You shouldn't say things like ‘No matter 
who calls her, I won’t allow it,’. Women's 
participation in politics is important. More 
importantly, everyone has the right to it. As 
a husband, you cannot deny her that right. 
Making joint decisions is one thing; blocking 
her entirely is another. Saying publicly that you 
won’t permit her to enter politics will subject 
you to severe criticism. Be mindful…”
With criticism mounting from all sides, 
Rajeevan quietly edited his Facebook post to 
read: "vdJ kidtp kA+upf;fh xU NghJk; 
murpaYf;F tukhl;lhu;. ahu; mioj;jhYk; 
mtu; tpUk;g khl;lhu;." (“My wife Mayurika 
will never enter politics. No matter who calls 
her, she will not be interested.”)
The shift in tone—from “I won’t allow it” to 
“she won’t be interested”—didn’t go unnoticed. 
He was doing what some have called the usual 
modus operandi of Jaffna Tamil politicians: 
quietly tweaking the words as if nothing had 
ever happened.
