R
emarks made by MP Kitnan Selvaraj, 
a first-time Tamil parliamentarian 
representing the National People's Power 
(NPP) from the Badulla District, have 
drawn criticism from political figures in the 
Northern Province. Selvaraj, a former estate 
worker and long-time advocate for plantation 
communities, referred to the proposal to 
merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces as 
an idea rooted in "Tamil extremism" during a 
recent parliamentary session. He also rejected 
calls for a separate Tamil state, prompting 
backlash from some Tamil political leaders.
Selvaraj's comments were perceived by critics 
as dismissive of longstanding Tamil demands 
for political autonomy and the historical 
grievances of Tamil communities. Among 
those who responded was Saba Kugathas, a 
former member of the Northern Provincial 
Council and a representative of the Eelam 
People's Revolutionary Liberation Front 
(EPRLF).

Tamil Leaders Criticize MP Selvaraj’s 
Stance on Northern-Eastern Merger</p>

In a statement, Kugathas accused Selvaraj 
of undermining the broader Tamil struggle 
for political rights and self-governance. He 
described the remarks as "reckless" and argued 
that they ignored the sacrifices made by Tamil 
civilians and others in pursuit of those goals.
"MP Selvaraj's comments fail to recognize the 
historical realities of Tamil settlements in the 
North and East. Instead of focusing on the 
pressing issues faced by the plantation workers 
who elected him, he appears to be echoing 
Sinhala nationalist rhetoric in Parliament," 
Kugathas said.
Kugathas also drew attention to ongoing 
challenges in the plantation sector, where 
workers continue to face low wages and 
poor living conditions. He urged Selvaraj to 
prioritize the concerns of his constituency over 
making divisive statements regarding Tamil 
rights.
Referencing the historical context of Tamil 
governance in the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces and the Indo-Lanka Accord, which 
recognized the merger of the two provinces, 
Kugathas challenged Selvaraj to better 
understand the complexities of the issue. 
He criticized the use of terms like "Tamil 
extremism" to describe the merger proposal, 
describing it as an approach that risks fueling 
further division.
The separation of the Northern and Eastern 
Provinces was the result of a court ruling 
initiated by the JVP, a party historically 
associated with Sinhala nationalist 
sentiments," Kugathas said. "Labeling the 
merger proposal as 'Tamil extremism' is not 
only misleading but also risks exacerbating 
existing divisions," he added.</p>

he sky was overcast. Kādaṉ  stood on the 
wooden watchtower and let his eyes roam. 
They swiftly scanned around Kusavai lake 
and surfaced on the east by the orchard of 
Indian laurel trees. The orchard seems to be 
in a trance without even a leaf stirring. Even

murder, seem to be fast asleep.
His eyes turned their gaze towards the sky. 
Not even a star glittered. The waning moon 
was bathing in the waters of the Mahāveli.
If the overcast sky would permit a drizzle 
soon, Kādaṉ would definitely score a hunt.
In his mindscape a herd of deer galloped away. 
Kādaṉ folded his arms, unfolded them again, 
and shook them vigorously. He turned towards 
Teacher:
“Teacher, get up; the morning star has risen.”
“How is it this cold? It seems it would even 
beat the cold spells in our Kandy town.”
“If we get a rainy season downpour here, your 
Kandy cannot hold a candle!” Kādaṉ said 
proudly.
Kandy Teacher warmed his arms and legs in 
the fire.
In a little while, the koṇdal wind began to 
blow from the east. Having let it carry away 
their human scent, they started circling 
Kusavai lake in a northeasterly direction.
Kādaṉ walked swiftly, Kandy Teacher jogging 
to keep up with him.
There were only two people in the village who 
could walk like Kādaṉ. One was Tiger Sēhu, 
and the other was the government functionary 
for the farms in the village, Nūhu.
The thorns along the way that dared to prick 
Kādaṉ’s soles were immediately blunted with 
a “snick”. The skin on his sole was taut and 
rigid like the skin on the neck of a fully grown 
sambar deer. Teacher kept running behind 
Kādaṉ, occasionally lifting a foot to sooth its 
sole being ravaged by thorns.
They both had the same thought, ‘Today we 
must find game meat to grill.’ Both were</p>

on the same quest. Kādaṉ resumed the 
conversation.
“Can I sleep just because it is night, Teacher? 
All day I have to herd the cows like a cow 
myself. In the evening, I have to go to the lake 
shore to catch fish for the boss — if there is 
no fish, I have to at least buy him some eggs 
cheaply. Occasionally, someone leaves town 
after being transferred elsewhere. On those 
days, I must grill them wild boar,” he hawked 
and spat the phlegm out.
His flashlight spotted something and focused 
on it. Against the pitch-black backdrop tiny 
green marbles glittered. ‘It is a herd of deer…’ 
his tongue curled inwards immediately.
“Chee! That is a just a bird, Teacher. Everyone 
talks about truth and justice at the beginning. 
As time goes by, every donkey shows its 
true colors. Among them Senanayake is the 
worst. They ogle at our women cutting grass. 
Our women also grin and giggle at them 
shamelessly,” Kādaṉ said disgustedly.
Teacher had a sudden realization.
He remembered the gossip he had heard about 
Kādaṉ’s wife.
‘Who knows what the truth is!’ ‘If we chatter 
like this, the deer will scramble! Kādaṉ must 
have had a little bit of Pāthamuthu rāthā’s 
ganja, perhaps.’ Teacher’s thoughts scrambled 
back into their shells like startled turtles.
“Teacher, let us warm ourselves a little at 
Puḷiyadipattu and circle Mōttāṉ lake. We’ll 
find something there.”
Teacher let out a “muh” as he shivered in the 
cold.
“Look Teacher, the tamarind tree has fruited. 
We need deer bones to cook with this 
tamarind,” Kādaṉ drooled at the thought.
“Dēy! Hanifā kākā, are you so cold? If you 
move any closer, you will be on fire yourself.”
Hanifā kākā sat up when he heard Kādaṉ’s 
voice. He shook his hands vigorously and 
alternated his hands and feet over the flames</p>
<p><img alt="p067_i1.jpg" src="../images_out/013_monitor_memo/p067_i1.jpg" /></p>

to warm up.
“Do we have any sugar? Let’s 
make some tea,” said Kādaṉ.
“How long since we set eyes on 
sugar!” exclaimed Hanifā kākā.
“Teacher! Get up. If we lounge 
around the fire like this, the job 
won’t get done,” Kādaṉ was 
keen to get on with the hunt.
“Kādeṉ! Go look in Mōttāṉ 
lake. When I was herding the 
cattle back home during the 
day, I saw that a sambar deer 
had been shot there. If you get 
lucky, don’t forget us,” Hanifā 
kākā rubbed his hands as he 
spoke. “Today, I came here 
because of Teacher. He is being 
transferred out. He is the one 
who taught our children the 
alphabet, at least. Our people 
didn’t even give him a farewell 
meal. If it had been an MP, they 
would have bought a couple 
of bottles, and roasted a wild 
deer.”
He slung the rifle over his 
shoulder and started walking, 
with Kandy Teacher following 
at a trot.
“Kādar! It is too cold. The 
cartilage on my nose is crying.”
“Yes, yes! Don’t make a noise,” 
Kādaṉ warned him as he 
scanned the lake shore with his 
flashlight.
The darkness enveloped and 
swallowed the rays of light. A herd of deer that jumped up 
and scrambled was caught in the light. The next instant the 
“bang!” of a gunshot shook the entire area.
The wounded deer desperately hobbled towards the cover 
of the bush, dragging its hooves. Teacher caught its feet and 
folded it, towards qibla, the direction towards Mecca.
As the lips muttered ‘Bismillah’, a knife was sunk into the 
deer’s neck.
After a few minutes, Kādaṉ sharpened his knife and began 
skinning the deer. In his hands, the knife danced over the 
deer’s body like an artist’s paintbrush.
“Teacher! I knew already! That mangy dog at the house by 
the tamarind tree is a lucky charm. If we encounter it on our 
way to the hunt, we will definitely succeed.”
The Teacher was panting, exhausted from carrying game 
meat. He was sweating profusely, despite the morning chill.
Daylight was slowly breaking.
“Teacher! Do you not have any muttāsi either? If I go home, 
I must have some tea, Teacher.”</p>

“Why don’t we go to the mosque? You have to 
smoke the meat for us anyway.”
“I can’t, Teacher. I will go home first, 
give some meat to the boss, sign in on the 
attendance register, and will come around by 
about eight.”
Carrying his share of the meat and the deer’s 
head, Kādaṉ turned the corner by the tamarind 
tree.
“Teacher! Be careful. Now is the time when 
elephants return to the jungle,” Kādaṉ’s words 
focused Teacher’s mind.
As Kādaṉ neared his home in the farm’s 
personnel quarters, he heard something 
following him. It was the mangy dog from the 
house by the tamarind tree. It was wagging its 
tail vigorously.
“Come, come, let’s go home.”
The dog followed him, smacking its lips.
When he reached home, he hung the meat 
hook on the barbed-wire fence. He wanted to 
relieve himself first …
As he set foot on the veranda, the voices from 
within the house penetrated his ears. His 
heart was like the wounded deer, desperately 
hobbling towards the cover of the bush, 
dragging its hooves. 
“Get up and get going. He will come soon.”
He felt as if a knife was sunk into his neck.
His stomach churned, even though it was still 
very early in the morning.
He hocked spit as hard as he could, and spat it 
out with disgust
He turned around.
There – the mangy dog from the house by the 
tamarind tree had savaged the meat hanging 
from the barbed wire fence.</p>
