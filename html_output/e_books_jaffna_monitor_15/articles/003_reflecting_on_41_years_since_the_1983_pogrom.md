Reflecting on 41 Years 
Since the 1983 Pogrom

his July 23rd marks 41 years since the 1983 ethnic 
pogrom, a dark chapter in Sri Lanka's history that 
profoundly reshaped the nation's political, economic, 
and social landscape. The violence, meticulously 
orchestrated by the then-UNP government under J.R. 
Jayewardene, set Sri Lanka on a path of destruction, 
igniting a brutal civil war that would last for decades 
and leave deep scars on the island's soul.
The pogrom was not a spontaneous eruption of 
violence but a calculated act, terrorizing an entire 
nation and radicalizing a generation of Tamil youth. In 
the wake of this carnage, many young Tamils, driven 
by despair and the belief that the Sinhala-majority 
government would kill them regardless, chose to take 
up arms. For them, the choice was clear: if death was 
inevitable, they would die fighting for dignity.
I have heard firsthand accounts of the profound 
impact of this violence. In one family, brothers 
joined different militant groups, united by a shared 
determination to resist a government they perceived 
as oppressive. This wave of radicalization catalyzed 
the emergence of a sophisticated and resilient Tamil 
resistance. The conflict that ensued wreaked havoc not 
only on the Tamil community but also on the Sinhala 
population. The LTTE's attacks on Sinhala areas, the 
resulting economic collapse, and the loss of countless 
lives derailed Sri Lanka from its potential trajectory— 
a nation that, given its strategic location and resources, 
could have been the Singapore of South Asia.

immediate loss of life and property. It led to a massive exodus of Tamils, creating a 
global diaspora whose influence is felt even today. The violence radicalized an entire 
generation, sowing seeds of hatred and mistrust that have yet to be fully eradicated.
It is important to make clear that this editorial is not a blanket indictment of the Sinhala 
people. I firmly believe that the 1983 pogrom was not an expression of the Sinhala 
community at large but rather the result of a meticulously planned and executed 
campaign by the JR government and its thugs.
A personal story from my own family illustrates this truth. My parents owe their very 
lives to a courageous Sinhala landlord, a man who, armed with whatever makeshift 
weapons he could find, stood steadfast against a mob determined to spill blood. He 
assured my father, "They can only reach you over my dead body." This man and his 
family were prepared to lay down their lives to protect my parents, embodying the true 
spirit of humanity and the teachings of Buddha.
However, what troubles me deeply is the silence of the majority during this pogrom. 
While it is true that many Sinhalese did not take part in the violence, it is equally true 
that the majority remained silent. Had more of these good-hearted Sinhalese come 
forward to stand against the mob, the outcome might have been different. Perhaps the 
pogrom would not have occurred, or at the very least, its effects would have been less 
devastating. But the silence of the majority enabled the violence to unfold unchecked.
As an editor from the minority Tamil community, my appeal is to the future. If ever 
again a mindless government dares to unleash violence upon a vulnerable community, 
I implore the silent majority to rise up and act. This is not just a Tamil issue—it is a Sri 
Lankan issue, one that affects us all. The 1983 pogrom and the brutal war that followed 
claimed countless lives on both sides, leaving a trail of devastation and loss that still 
haunts our nation. We cannot afford to be silent bystanders in the face of such hatred. 
The cost of inaction is too great, the price of silence too heavy to bear.
We must remember that our true enemy is not each other, but the insidious forces of 
hatred and division that seek to tear us apart. It is only through unity, courage, and a 
shared commitment to peace and the equitable sharing of power with Tamils that we 
can hope to prevent such a tragedy from ever occurring again. Let this 41st anniversary 
serve as a stark reminder of the devastating cost of silence and the transformative 
power of standing together against violence and oppression.
