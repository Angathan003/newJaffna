T
hambapillai Maheswaran, a prominent 
early figure in the Sri Lankan Tamil 
struggle and leader of the Tamil militant 
group Tamil Eelam Army (TEA), has 
passed away due to a heart attack in 
Jaffna. Maheswaran was renowned for his 
daredevil attacks during the early days 
of the Eelam liberation struggle, which 
preceded and, to some degree, inspired a 
few daring operations carried out by the 
LTTE. His actions were pivotal in shaping 
the early course of the Tamil militants' 
fight against the chauvinistic Sinhala 
government.

Maheswaran hails from an affluent family in 
Pungudutivu. His father, Thambippillai, was 
a prosperous businessman who, like many 
residents of Pungudutivu, ventured into the 
restaurant business. He owned the renowned 
Dhawalagiri Hotel in Colombo's Maradana 
and was a highly successful entrepreneur who 
sold his hotel for reasons best known to him 
before the 1980s.
Interestingly, despite his father's name being 
Thambippillai, it was often mispronounced 
as Thambapillai. This led to Maheswaran 
being commonly known as Thambapillai 
Maheswaran. In an ironic twist, Maheswaran's 
militant group was initially called the Thampa 
Group, a mispronunciation of his father's 
name.
Maheswaran's siblings are thriving and live 
comfortably in Western countries. His sister 
is a doctor, one of his brothers is a retired 
accountant, his younger brother is settled 
in the USA, and his elder sister resides in 
the UK. Their family's financial success, 
primarily from the hotel business, enabled 
them to send Maheswaran to the prestigious 
Queen's College, London University, in the 
mid-1970s. During his time in London, he 
lived with his elder sister, who was married 
to a well-established accountant. Sources 
close to Maheswaran revealed that he initially 
studied civil engineering before switching to 
aeronautical engineering.
While in London, Maheswaran befriended 
Anton Balasingam and Ratnasabapathy, a 
founding member of the Eelam Revolutionary 
Organization of Students (EROS). At that time, 
Anton Balasingam, who would later become 
the LTTE's theoretician, had not yet formed 
connections with the LTTE or its leader, 
Prabhakaran. During Maheswaran's funeral 
service, the People's Liberation Organisation of 
Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) leader Dharmalingam 
Siddarthan stated that Anton Balasingham was 
influenced to join the LTTE by Maheswaran. 
Siddarthan mentioned that Maheswaran 
was instrumental in introducing Anton 
Balasingham to the LTTE.
Sources close to Maheswaran told the Jaffna 
Monitor that he had his first sips of alcohol in 
London with Anton Balasingam, a habit that 
later became a detrimental element in his life.
Some sources suggest that Maheswaran was 
genuinely driven by a fervent desire for Tamil 
liberation. They depict him as a man deeply 
committed to the Tamil cause, motivated by 
a passionate resolve to free his people from 
oppression and bring about social justice.
However, another set of sources offers a 
contrasting view. They argue that Maheswaran 
was primarily impulsive, more captivated by 
the thrill of executing audacious attacks on the 
Sinhala army and the Sri Lankan government 
than by any profound understanding of ethnic 
liberation. This perspective likens him to his 
counterpart, LTTE supremo Prabhakaran, 
who is also seen as having a penchant for 
bold, high-stakes operations rather than the 
nuanced political strategy that would help 
achieve ultimate ethnic liberation.
True to his impulsive style, which later became 
evident in his numerous attacks, Maheswaran 
discontinued his studies and returned to 
Sri Lanka in 1980 after taking his sister's 
jewelry to fuel his efforts. A close friend of 
Maheswaran informed the Jaffna Monitor that 
his elder sister often lamented his decision to 
abandon his valuable education and return 
to Sri Lanka with her jewels. In response, 
Maheswaran said, as his close friend revealed, 
"With your jewelry, I did not do anything for

Jaffna Monitor

23
myself. I just purchased two revolvers."
Despite this disappointment, sources say 
that Maheswaran maintained a very good 
relationship with his family until his death. 
Maheswaran, who remained unmarried 
throughout his life, was financially supported 
by his siblings in his later years.
Friends who studied with Maheswaran at 
Jaffna Central College informed the Jaffna 
Monitor that he was a brilliant student with 
a sharp memory and excelled in sports. 
He played cricket and football for Central 
College and participated in a few matches 
representing his school. This combination of 
academic brilliance and athletic talent made 
Maheswaran a notable figure during his school 
years.
'Panagoda' Maheswaran
Maheswaran cemented his legendary status in 
the 1980s with a daring escape from Panagoda 
Military Camp, a high-security detention 
center. Ingeniously, he cut through the iron 
window bars of his cell, concealed the cuts 
with chewing gum, and made his escape in 
early 1983. This audacious act celebrated as 
the first jailbreak in Sri Lankan history, earned 
him the nickname "Panagoda Maheswaran" 
and garnered immense respect and admiration 
among Tamil youths.
However, his bold escape was short-lived; 
he was arrested the very next day following 
a tip-off from a Muslim household in 
Peliyagoda. This episode not only showcased 
his remarkable ability to execute daring actions 
but also highlighted the gaps in his planning 
and strategy.
A close friend of Maheswaran told the Jaffna 
Monitor that, after a few drinks, he often 
confronted him, even recently, asking, "You 
were just an impulsive youth without any 
proper ideology or plan for the liberation of 
an ethnicity. If you had one, things might have 
been different." The friend elaborated on his 
argument, explaining, "Your family sent you 
to London to study at a prestigious university. 
Instead of completing your studies, you ran 
back to Sri Lanka. If your true motive was to 
liberate our people, you would have stayed in 
London and supported a militant movement 
from there or joined an existing militant 
group. Instead, you returned to Sri Lanka and 
started a new militant group, revealing your 
bourgeois mentality." According to this source, 
Maheswaran felt uncomfortable with the 
confrontation and could not provide a proper 
response.
Narrow Escapes and Daring Plans: The 
Welikada and Batticaloa Prison Breaks
Maheswaran was one of the few who narrowly 
escaped the brutal violence that erupted inside 
Welikada Prison during the July riots. Amid 
the state-sponsored attacks on Tamil political 
prisoners by Sinhala mobs, Maheswaran, along 
with Douglas Devananda, an early militant 
who is now the EPDP general secretary and 
a cabinet minister, used makeshift weapons 
fashioned from twisted bedsheets and other 
items to block the cell doors and fend off 
the bloodthirsty attackers. Devananda often 
credited Maheswaran's quick thinking and 
sharp mind with saving his life during that 
harrowing time.
Following this incident, Maheswaran and other 
survivors of the state-sponsored jail pogrom 
were transferred to Batticaloa Prison. It was 
here that Maheswaran and his fellow inmates 
orchestrated one of the most daring escapes 
in Sri Lankan history: the infamous Batticaloa 
jailbreak on September 23, 1983, exactly two

24
months after the riots. While inside the 
prison, Maheswaran meticulously planned 
the escape, including the escape route and 
vehicles, with the help of his local fighters 
outside.
Funding the Fight: Maheswaran's 
Audacious Bank Heists
During a period when Tamil Eelam 
liberation movements financed their 
activities through bank robberies, 
Maheswaran's Tamil Eelam Army (TEA) 
successfully executed several heists, with 
the most famous one occurring at the 
People's Bank in Kathankudy, Batticaloa, in 
1984. In this audacious raid, the TEA seized 
cash and jewelry worth approximately 30 
million rupeesâ€”a massive sum at the time. 
During the heist, the TEA also captured a 
high-end 250 cc white police motorcycle. 
According to sources, this motorcycle was 
later transported to Chennai by sea and 
subsequently found in an LTTE camp in 
Tamil Nadu. Readers will soon understand 
how the TEA-seized bike ended up in the 
LTTE camp in Tamil Nadu.
The Kilinochchi Attack: A Blueprint 
for Future Operations
On September 23, 1985, Maheswaran 
planned a vehicle-borne explosive attack 
on the Kilinochchi police and army joint 
camp, a tactic that would later become a 
hallmark of the LTTE. As an explosives 
specialist, Maheswaran and his team rigged 
a lorry with explosives and staged a petrol 
tanker nearby. They sent both vehicles near 
the Kilinochchi army camp simultaneously, 
planning that when the explosive-laden 
lorry detonated, the resulting fire would 
ignite the petrol tanker, creating a massive 
explosion. The lorry exploded at midnight, 
causing significant damage to the police 
station and surrounding areas, although the 
petrol tanker failed to detonate.
The Tamil Eelam Army claimed 
responsibility, with Maheswaran directly 
overseeing the operation. Using his 
technical knowledge gained in London, 
Maheswaran executed one of the earliest 
vehicle-borne explosive attacks. This 
method was later adopted by the LTTE and 
famously used in the attack on Nelliady by 
Captain Miller (Vallipuram Vasanthan) on 
July 5, 1987, on the Sri Lanka Army base 
at Nelliady Madhya Maha Vidyalayam. 
Credible sources within the LTTE told the 
Jaffna Monitor that the LTTE, inspired by 
Maheswaran's Kilinochchi attack, planned 
the Nelliady attack with a simple logic: 
what would have been the effect if they had 
sent a fighter (suicide bomber) in the lorry. 
This led to the brutal legacy of the LTTE 
Black Tigers, the notorious suicide squad.

Doubts About India's Intentions
Sources close to Maheswaran in his early 
militant days conveyed to the Jaffna Monitor 
that he always harbored doubts about the true 
intentions of India's intervention in the Sri 
Lankan Tamil problem. Maheswaran often 
stressed the need for a base outside India, 
saying, "We can't completely trust India." He 
attempted to establish a base on an island in 
the Maldives, but that failed. He also tried to 
set up operations in an African country, but 
this too was unsuccessful.
Despite these setbacks, Maheswaran pioneered 
the procurement of arms from foreign 
countries, although the weapons he obtained 
were less sophisticated than those the LTTE 
would later acquire. In this regard, he was 
ahead of his time, paving the way for future 
arms procurement efforts.
Meenambakkam Bomb Blast
All hell broke loose when Maheswaran 
masterminded the Meenambakkam bomb 
blast on August 2, 1984, at Meenambakkam 
International Airport, now known as Chennai 
International Airport. Maheswaran intended 
to cripple the Sri Lankan economy by targeting 
Katunayake Airport. He placed bombs in two 
suitcases loaded onto an airplane bound for Sri 
Lanka, intending the blast to strike an airport 
in Colombo. The timer was set for detonation 
at 10:52 p.m., just as Air Lanka flight UL-122 
was scheduled to reach Colombo International 
Airport. The aircraft was to leave Madras 
(Chennai), India, at 8:10 p.m. that evening. 
The Maheswaran's plan was to explode the 
bomb after the luggage was removed from the 
plane in Sri Lanka and dispatched to the cargo 
complex. The intensity of the blast was set so 
high that it would have destroyed at least six 
planes at the airport.
Maheswaran purchased a ticket for the Air 
Lanka flight but never boarded the plane. 
He attempted to transmit the luggage to the 
intended Air Lanka flight, but the suitcases 
were mistakenly included in baggage for a 
flight to London. When Maheswaran was 
identified as the only passenger not to board 
the aircraft, customs authorities detained 
the luggage. The Air Lanka flight took off 
around 8:15 p.m. without the bombs on board. 
Maheswaran monitored the entire incident 
from within the airport and made repeated 
calls warning the airport authorities about the 
bombs in the confiscated luggage.
Though the police eventually tried to retrieve 
the luggage, a customs inspector objected 
to handing over the baggage, believing it 
contained contraband, most likely gold 
bars, which he may have thought to pocket 
for himself. Maheswaran made two more 
anonymous calls warning that the luggage 
contained explosives that would detonate 
around 11:00 p.m., but only after the third call

did the customs inspector concede to hand 
over the suitcases.
By then, it was too late. The blast occurred at 
10:52 p.m. when a baggage handler attempted 
to move the luggage to a more secure location. 
The explosion rocked the international arrival 
hall, killing over 31 people, including 23 Sri 
Lankan nationals, among them a few Sri 
Lankan Tamils and a woman from Kilinochchi. 
Another 38 people were injured. The blast 
was so powerful that one victim's head was 
severed and flung 150 feet away. The explosion 
brought the concrete ceiling of the arrival 
hall down, dismembering several passengers 
from Colombo who were waiting for an early 
morning flight to Abu Dhabi. The concrete 
roof of the Customs baggage inspection hall 
crumbled, and debris and splinters of glass 
panes were strewn all over the arrival hall and 
the adjoining tarmac.
Maheswaran and ten others were arrested, 
but he later jumped bail. He was eventually 
rearrested and remained in jail until his release 
in 2010.
Uncovering the Truth Behind the 
Bombing
When the Meenambakkam bomb blast 
occurred, the blame naturally fell on the LTTE, 
as it was the most active and well-known 
militant group operating in Tamil Nadu at the 
time. The majority of Tamil newspapers and 
the general public in Tamil Nadu referred to 
all militant groups and fighters as "Tigers," 
leading to widespread belief that the LTTE 
was responsible for the heinous attack. 
Consequently, LTTE supremo Prabhakaran 
ordered his fighters to uncover the true 
perpetrators of the bombing with concrete 
evidence.
Karuna Amman, who would later become 
the LTTE's military chief for the Batticaloa-
Ampara district, took on the task. Despite 
Maheswaran being from northern Jaffna, the 
majority of his Tamil Eelam Army (TEA) 
fighters hailed from Batticaloa. Utilizing 
his local Batticaloa connections, Karuna 
discovered that the TEA was behind the 
bombing. Credible sources within the LTTE 
told the Jaffna Monitor that this crucial 
information was conveyed to the Indian and 
Tamil Nadu authorities by the Tigers, who later 
announced their findings as their own.
The Aftermath of the Meenambakkam 
Bomb Blast
Following the Meenambakkam bomb blast 
that led TEA leader Maheswaran to go 
underground and the LTTE's ban on all 
other militant organizations, including the 
TEA, many TEA members either joined the 
LTTE or left the movement. It was said that 
Maheswaran instructed his fighters to avoid 
confrontations with the LTTE, surrender their 
arms, and leave peacefully. Consequently, 
prominent TEA members such as Thampirasa, 
Siththa, 'Appuchi' Varathan, and around 25-30 
others joined the LTTE and were trained at the 
LTTE's 10th training camp in Kolathur.
Siththa, now living peacefully in a European 
country, was hailed as a daring fighter by 
the LTTE. 'Appuchi' Varathan became a 
trusted lieutenant to Pottu Amman and 
masterminded the Joint Operations Command 
(JOC) bombing on Flower Road. He later 
consumed cyanide and died at the house of 
Up-Country People's Front leader Periyasamy 
Chandrasekaran.
A former prominent LTTE member who 
interacted closely with ex-TEA guards told 
the Jaffna Monitor that although he never met 
Maheswaran, he always believed Maheswaran

must have been a formidable fighter and an 
inspiring leader, judging by the dedication and 
performance of the TEA fighters who joined 
the LTTE.
The Heavy Conscience of Maheswaran
Close friends of Maheswaran revealed to 
the Jaffna Monitor that in his later life, 
Maheswaran became a prisoner of his 
conscience. He deeply regretted many of his 
actions, particularly the Meenambakkam 
bomb blast. In addition to this well-known 
incident, he felt profound remorse for a lesser-
known incident involving the execution of 
three goldsmiths.
While the Meenambakkam bomb blast 
was widely known, the story of the three 
goldsmiths remained largely unknown. 
Maheswaran's daring bank robbery in 
Kathankudy resulted in his team escaping with 
3 crores worth of money and a substantial 
amount of gold. His Tamil Eelam Army 
(TEA) later entrusted part of this gold to 
three goldsmiths in Nelliady, Vadamarachi, 
to be melted down. When the goldsmiths 
cheated him by keeping a few grams of gold 
during the process, an enraged Maheswaran 
summoned them to a hideout and ordered 
their execution. Additionally, he ordered a few 
other executions in Batticaloa and Jaffna in the 
name of destroying traitors.
Sources close to Maheswaran mentioned that 
he often felt a deep sense of guilt over these 
killings. He would reflect on the lives lost by 
his command and the brutal decisions he had 
made. As the years passed, the daring militant 
who once inspired fear and admiration became 
a man tormented by his past, haunted by the 
shadows of his own actions.
What happened to the large sum of 3 crores 
stolen in the Kathankudy bank robbery by the 
TEA remains a subject of intrigue. While part 
of it was used for arms procurement and other 
activities, sources say that a large portion of 
the money was swindled by TEA members. In 
one incident, it was an open secret that one of

Maheswaran's deputies was building a house in 
Jaffna with the help of that money.
Maheswaran's Leadership Style
Within the TEA, sources say Maheswaran was 
commonly called "Thamba." He wasn't referred 
to as a leader, commander, or comrade; the 
fighters in his organization habitually called 
him 'Annaachi.' "Annaachi" is a term used in 
Batticaloa to express elder brotherly affection.
Even though Maheswaran's TEA operated 
primarily in Sinhala border villages in 
Batticaloa, Ampara, and Polonnaruwa, and 
in Muslim villages, they did not engage 
in violence against the local people. His 
organization maintained a relationship of 
mutual understanding with Sinhala and 
Muslim communities, as well as with other 
militant organizations.
When the LTTE banned other militant 
organizations, Maheswaran did not openly 
oppose the ban. A former TEA fighter 
reasoned that understanding one's strengths 
and weaknesses and saving the fighters was 
a leader's responsibility, and that is what 
Maheswaran did by not opposing the LTTE. 
This does not mean he accepted the LTTE's 
ban; interpreting it that way would be a 
misunderstanding, he said.
Later Life and Death
After the Meenambakkam bomb blast, 
Maheswaran was imprisoned in India for 
12 years. Following his release, he went to 
Tanzania, reportedly to reunite with his family 
members who were in Western countries. 
However, this reunion did not happen easily. 
Maheswaran violated visa regulations and 
was jailed again in Tanzania for breaking 
visa rules. After being freed, he returned to 
Sri Lanka, a passage facilitated by Minister 
Douglas Devananda, who was also a friend 
of Maheswaran and a former jail mate in 
Panagoda Army Camp and Welikada Prison.
Maheswaran's death surprisingly attracted 
condolences from all quarters, including die-
hard LTTE supporters. The Transnational 
Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE)'s 
so-called Prime Minister, Visvanathan 
Rudrakumaran, in a press release, stated that 
the loss of Thambapillai Maheswaran, a great 
man who firmly stood on the path of the Tamil 
Eelam liberation struggle, has plunged them 
into immense grief.
Ironically, sources close to Maheswaran 
revealed that he always vehemently opposed 
the TGTE, often expressing his disdain for 
the organization. In his view, it was as if he 
wanted to "bite them and eat them." Moreover, 
the Tamil National People's Front (TNPF), 
known for its self-proclaimed authority in 
labeling traitors and patriots, added to the 
irony. The TNPF's troublemakers, including 
Member of Parliament Kajendran and media 
spokesperson Sugash Kanagaratnam, bestowed 
upon Maheswaran the title of patriot. Another 
Tamil nationalist politician, Sivagnanam 
Shritharan, expressed his condolences in 
parliament.
It's well known that in his later life, 
Maheswaran aligned himself with the EPDP 
and maintained a close friendship with its 
leader, Minister Douglas Devananda, a former 
jail mate from Welikada and Panagoda Army 
Camp. After being released from an Indian 
prison in 2010, Maheswaran attempted to 
move to Tanzania to join his siblings. However, 
due to visa restrictions, he was jailed in 
Tanzania as well. Later, he contacted Douglas 
Devananda, who facilitated his return to Sri 
Lanka. Devananda personally cleared him at 
the airport, took him to his house in Colombo,

Jaffna Monitor

29
and provided him with refuge.
Although Maheswaran was not an active EPDP 
member, he fully aligned himself with the 
EPDP later in life. This may be the first time 
in history that a person closely associated with 
the EPDP received condolences from LTTE 
proxies, adding a layer of unexpected irony to 
the tributes following his death.
A few years before his death, at an EPDP 
party meeting, Maheswaran reportedly said 
in anger, "The foolish actions of Prabhakaran 
have led to the failure of this struggle." The 
irony now lies in the same people who once 
regarded Prabhakaran as a god, offering 
their condolences and even proclaiming 
Maheswaran as a patriot and pillar of Tamil 
Eelam.
Irony in Admiration
A close friend of Maheswaran offered 
an intriguing perspective on why LTTE 
sympathizers are now hailing Maheswaran, a 
leader of a different militant group they always 
considered traitorous. In the LTTE's lexicon, 
any group other than their own was deemed 
a traitor. He reasoned that Maheswaran's 
lack of confrontation with the LTTE when it 
banned his Tamil Eelam Army (TEA) played a 
significant role. Instead of opposing the LTTE, 
Maheswaran ordered his guards to comply, 
which likely spared him from being targeted by 
Prabhakaran. Additionally, Maheswaran spent 
a significant portion of his prime years in jail, 
which meant he wasn't actively functioning as 
a militant leader. Had he been free, he would 
have undoubtedly been on Prabhakaran's hit 
list, the friend said.
The friend further elaborated, saying that 
Maheswaran, in many ways, was a precursor 
to or similar to Prabhakaran. He was daring, 
ruthless, and more focused on executing 
shocking attacks than on developing a 
comprehensive ethnic liberation strategy. 
Both Prabhakaran and Maheswaran had little 
regard for human lives. He quipped that if 
Maheswaran had been in Prabhakaran's place, 
he would have likely transformed the LTTE 
into an equally formidable war machine. 
However, with the same relentless drive and 
disregard for human life, Maheswaran would 
have ultimately steered it toward the same 
tragic fate at Mullivaikal.
