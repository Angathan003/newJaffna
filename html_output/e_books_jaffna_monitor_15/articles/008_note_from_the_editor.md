Dear Readers,
"Mahathaya's Saga: Power, Paranoia, and 
Politics in LTTE" is a series that is very near to 
my heart and resonates deeply with many of 
you. It has brought many hardcore readers to 
the Jaffna Monitor, for which I am immensely 
grateful.
As the editor of the Jaffna Monitor, I am 
often overwhelmed with the demands of my 
work. Writing this series requires immense 
dedication, extensive fieldwork, and a 
significant amount of time. Consequently, I 
have been unable to continue the series in the 
last few issues.
I sincerely apologize for this interruption 
and any disappointment it may have caused. 
Please rest assured, this does not mean I have 
stopped it. I will start writing it again, though 
I cannot promise to release it every fortnight. 
Nevertheless, I am committed to continuing 
this important series and sharing it with you as 
often as possible.
Thank you for your understanding and 
continued support.
Sincerely,
fzpad; G+q;Fd;wd;

Note 
from the 
Editor
last breath, as all had tragically died before 
her. Her elder daughter met a heartbreaking 
end, accidentally drowning in the well 
at their home. One son, overwhelmed 
by despair, took his own life. Another 
succumbed to a debilitating illness. Her son, 
Lt. Vasan, died a hero, fighting for the LTTE. 
The fate of her son, Engineer, remains a 
mystery, though it is widely believed that he 
was killed by the LTTE.
Punitham Akka, a woman who had selflessly 
nurtured, sheltered, and fed countless 
fighters, was left to die in heartbreaking 
solitude. In her final days, she was 
abandoned by fate, empty and sorrowful. 
Those who were with her told the Jaffna 
Monitor that she spent her last moments in a 
vain and desperate search for her elder son, 
Engineer, though parts of her contemplated 
that he was no more.
Her life, filled with immense sacrifices, 
ended in heart-wrenching loneliness. She 
had given everything for the vision of Tamil 
Eelam, yet was left to die like an orphan by 
the very cause she dedicated her life to. How 
can one explain this to her? While one of her 
sons died heroically fighting for the LTTE, 
her other son, also an LTTE fighter, was 
killed by the LTTE itself, branded a traitor.
Punitham Akka's story is not unique. 
Many mothers, like her, were ensnared in 
this brutal web, losing their lives and their 
beloved children. The anguish of these 
mothers, who sacrificed everything only 
to be betrayed by the cause they served, is 
a haunting testament to the profound and 
often overlooked human cost of the Tamil 
Eelam conflict. These women, who gave their 
all for a dream of freedom and dignity, were 
left with nothing but grief and desolation.
