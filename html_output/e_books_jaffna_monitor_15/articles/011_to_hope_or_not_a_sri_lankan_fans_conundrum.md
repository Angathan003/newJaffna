Sri Lankan cricket without hope? Hope can be both inspiring 
and agonizing. If you're a Sri Lankan fan, you've experienced the

The recently concluded Lanka Premier League 
was bittersweet. The close contests, improved 
batting conditions, and most of the national 
players hitting form were major positives. Yet, 
beyond all that, it emphasized one crucial 
point: the players forming the national squad 
are the best our system has produced, and 
there is no concrete evidence to suggest 
otherwise. This alone is an uncomfortable 
reality. If this is the best set of players we have, 
can we truly aspire to a better future when 
the 2026 World T20 takes place in our own 
backyard?
You may wonder why one should think about 
a tournament two years in advance. In reality, 
this build-up will breeze through. With T20Is 
being few and far between, and Sri Lankan 
players not highly sought after in major T20 
leagues, the scope for auditions is limited. This 
means every game mattersâ€”even the LPL 
matters. However, while the LPL is intended 
to be a breeding ground for the national T20 
setup, it falls short of this goal. The auction 
dynamics and selection decisions all point to 
the same conclusion. One can't complain, as 
franchise cricket is run with the interests of 
the franchise in mind. A glaring observation 
was that almost no young players got enough 
game time in the top order during this LPL. It 
was either the national or international players 
who dominated these crucial phases.
In this context, the question that should be 
at the top of any fan's mind is: What should 
the Sri Lankan management focus on? To 
begin with, Sri Lanka's T20 campaign was a 
disaster, mainly due to a lack of awareness and 
poor strategy. As frustrating as this is, there 
is a silver lining. While skill sets are hard to 
develop in short time spans, strategy is an

evolving factor. If used correctly, it can act as a 
massive tailwind.
Sri Lanka's obsession with bits-and-pieces 
players as all-rounders has been a major factor 
derailing our cricket. The decision to boost 
the batting at the expense of a solid bowling 
option was a low point in the World T20, 
which ended our hopes in the game against 
Bangladesh. Sri Lanka needs to come to terms 
with the fact that we don't have players of 
the caliber of Jayasuriya or Dilshan to fulfill 
that role perfectly. Sri Lanka must commit to 
playing five solid bowling options and utilize 
Wanindu Hasaranga as an all-rounder at 
number six.
Chamindu Wickramasinghe, a promising 
young all-rounder known for his aggressive 
batting and reliable medium-pace bowling, 
could be a valuable addition to the team. With 
Dasun Shanaka not making the most of his 
opportunities, Wickramasinghe at number 
seven would be a good option to explore in the 
short run while hoping Shanaka finds his way 
back.
Sri Lanka has a rich bowling attack that shall 
remain the frontline option. However, what 
will be key to continuous success are the 
backup options available. Dushan Hemantha 
seems to have edged out Vijayakanth 
Viyaskanth in this year's edition. Viyaskanth, 
who was part of the reserves for the World 
Cup, needed a strong tournament performance 
to earn a call-up to the main squad for the 
upcoming Indian series. Unfortunately, his dip 
in performance has come at the wrong time, 
which may act as a setback but could also be 
a valuable learning experience in his budding 
career. While the LPL didn't reveal any new 
potential finds, if Sri Lanka uses its current 
resources prudently, the options by 2026 could 
be more than decent.
As for the batting, the questions are obvious, 
but the answers are not yet clear. Asalanka, 
in a leadership capacity, is expected to slot in 
at number five, while Nissanka seems set to 
open. Mendis will be expected to find his form 
and continue at the top, while Kamindu and 
Avishka are good options for the three and 
four positions. Despite stellar performances 
in the LPL, both Kusal Janith and Dinesh 
Chandimal seem to be less attractive options 
for the long term due to past failures. A 
hopeful option is Janith Liyanage, who has 
performed well in limited opportunities and 
can be expected to be part of the plans as the 
Sri Lankan camp approaches the 2026 World 
Cup.
While it may seem unrealistic, based on facts 
and logic, Sri Lanka should brace themselves 
to fare much better in 2026. The journey 
starts with the Indian series. Irrespective of 
the outcome, hopefully, sense and stability 
will prevail in the system to ensure that Sri 
Lanka does not approach the next edition of 
the World Cup like a student turning up for 
an exam unaware of which sections will be 
questioned.
Sri Lanka's anachronistic approaches and 
choices have pushed the game down the drain, 
much to the frustration of a loyal fanbase. The 
lead-up to and culmination of the upcoming 
T20 cycle will be interesting, with much 
scrutiny on decisions and choices. The stakes 
are high, and as a fan, you can't do much but 
hope.
Hope is inspiring; hope is painful. What will 
it be this time? Only time will tell how hope 
serves Sri Lankan fans in this World T20 cycle
