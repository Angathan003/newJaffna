Remembrance and 
Reflections on the 
End of Conflict
As we approach the anniversary of May 18, 2009, the Jaffna 
Monitor dedicates this edition to the solemn remembrance 
of the Sri Lankan Civil War's brutal conclusion. In the 
poignant words of Indian writer Khushwant Singh from 
his book Train to Pakistan: "According to the Hindus, the 
Muslims were to blame. According to the Muslims, the 
Hindus were to blame. The fact is, both sides killed." The 
same tragic truth applies to the war that culminated on May 
18, 2009â€”both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government 
committed atrocities and war crimes.
The Sri Lankan government indiscriminately shelled and 
bombed its own citizens, while the LTTE, claiming to be 
the protectors and guardians of Sri Lankan Tamils, shame-
fully used their own people as human shields and ruthlessly 
abducted and enlisted innocent Tamil children as young as 
12 and 13 years old into their losing war.
The reality of such conflicts is that there are no innocents 
in the theater of war, only victims and perpetrators on all 
sides. This edition of the Jaffna Monitor seeks to uncover 
these harsh truths through exclusive interviews and first-
hand accounts that shed new light on the final phase of the 
Sri Lankan Civil War, and we aim to continue this reporting 
for our next issue. 
We are privileged to present an extensive interview with 
Erik Solheim, who, during the crucial years, played a piv-
otal role in Sri Lanka's peace process. Solheim now advises 
President Ranil Wickremesinghe on climate change initia-
tives, continuing his commitment to service in different 
capacities. His insights into the peace negotiations and the 
final days of the conflict are invaluable for understanding

the complexities of reconciliation and the long road ahead. Moreover, Solheim 
shared many thoughts not only about the past but also about the present chal-
lenges Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Tamil community face.
In a particularly moving segment, we hear from "Niththilan", a brave UN work-
er who breaks his silence for the first time with the Jaffna Monitor. Appointed in 
September 2008 to lead the UN operations in LTTE-controlled territory, Nith-
thilan faced unimaginable challenges as he directed local staff after international 
organizations were ordered to evacuate. 
This issue also features a poignant interview with a former LTTE child abduc-
tor now living abroad. In a candid revelation of his past misdeeds, he expresses 
deep remorse and reflects on the impact of his actions on himself and others. 
Lastly, we bring you the exclusive story of Giovanni Porta, the foreign aid work-
er who defied the Sri Lankan government's evacuation orders. His testimony 
provides a unique perspective on the conflict and highlights the international 
dimension of the war's final days.
Our goal is to ignite a dialogue that promotes understanding, fosters peace, and 
builds resilience. The Jaffna Monitor remains unwavering in its commitment to 
truth and transparency, recognizing these values as the foundation of a just and 
inclusive society.
We do not seek to assign blame. While we cannot change history or bring back 
the lives lost in the brutal war, we believe that as a community, we can collec-
tively ensure these events do not recur by educating people about what tran-
spired during the conflict.
We invite our readers to engage deeply with these stories, honor the past, and 
actively contribute to shaping a more peaceful future.
