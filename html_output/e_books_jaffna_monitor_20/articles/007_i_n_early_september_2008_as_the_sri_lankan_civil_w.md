I
n early September 2008, as the Sri Lankan 
Civil War neared its harrowing conclusion, 
the Sri Lankan government issued a critical 
directive that would significantly alter the 
course of the conflict. During one of the most 
intense phases of the nearly three-decade-long 
war, all foreign NGOs and United Nations 
agencies were ordered to evacuate from 
LTTE-controlled areas. The government cited 
escalating insecurity and rigorous military 
operations as reasons, asserting the move was 
necessary to ensure the safety of international 
staff. 
This order drastically changed the 
humanitarian landscape, creating a significant 
void in aid delivery and the monitoring of 
human rights during a crucial time.
Amid this dramatic backdrop, Giovanni Porta, 
the Programme Manager for ZOA Refugee 
Care operating within LTTE-held regions, 
made a courageous choice. Defying the 
evacuation order, Porta was the sole foreign aid 
worker who decided to stay behind for several 
extra days, placing humanitarian needs above 
his own safety.
Now residing in a Southeast Asian country and 
working with another NGO, Porta has granted 
the Jaffna Monitor an exclusive interview. 
This conversation comes as we mark the 15th 
anniversary of the brutal conclusion of the Sri 
Lankan Civil War on May 18, 2009. Here, we 
present key insights from our discussion with 
Porta, reflecting on his experiences and the 
broader implications of the conflict's end.

What motivated you 
to remain in LTTE-
controlled areas 
despite the Sri 
Lankan government's 
directives, especially 
as the conflict 
escalated and your 
safety could not be 
guaranteed?
Like all other international 
aid organizations and 
workers, I was instructed to 
leave the LTTE-controlled 
region. We were given a 
mere two weeks, and the 
directive was abrupt. In a 
way, that order seemed to 
demand that I abandon my 
local colleagues at ZOA and 
the people I had faithfully 
served. Leaving felt like 
an inappropriate response 
to such a rash order. So, I 
stayed.
How would you 
describe your 
relationship with the 
LTTE? Some Sinhala 
newspapers portrayed 
you as an LTTE 
sympathizer.
In fact, working with the 
LTTE presented significant 
challenges. They forcibly abducted my staff for conscription 
and ransacked my house. My decision to stay was not driven by 
a good relationship with the LTTE, but by a profound sense of 
responsibility toward my local staff. I believed that abandoning 
them would be wrong, as they were caught between the Sri 
Lankan government and the LTTE. Before leaving, I wanted to 
ensure that my staff were safely hidden in a jungle area, equipped 
with all the basic necessities. Additionally, as the security 
coordinator for all NGOs, I felt an immense responsibility 
toward the local workers employed by foreign NGOs. I did 
everything in my power to protect and support them during 
those critical times.  
Why did the LTTE ransack your house?
The LTTE had suspicions that I might be an agent for the Sri 
Lankan government or some other foreign entity. I was not 
willing to make certain compromises with the LTTE, and I 
refused to provide them with some materials that we had, which 
infuriated them. Additionally, I travelled to areas within the

LTTE-held territories where others could 
hardly imagine going. All these factors led 
them to believe I might be a spy or an agent. 
One day, the LTTE ransacked my house while 
I was not there, but civilians informed me 
that high-ranking officers from the LTTE's 
intelligence wing conducted the search. 
When I found out, my house was completely 
ransacked. In response, I went to the LTTE 
office, which was responsible for overseeing 
NGOs. I took my laptop with me, confronted 
them, and said, "Here is the laptop; I know you 
were looking for this. Take it and check." They 
had no response to my challenge.
 How many days did you stay in the 
LTTE-held area after you were ordered 
to leave?
 I stayed for about 10 days. One day, my 
office in Colombo called me and relayed a 
message from the Defense Ministry, warning 
that if I did not leave, there could be severe 
consequences for my organization, possibly 
leading to the shutdown of all its activities in 
Sri Lanka. Considering the potential impact on 
the organization and its mission, I decided to 
leave the LTTE-held area.
How did you leave the LTTE-held area?
I travelled to Muhamalai, where my mission 
had arranged for someone to pick me up. 
Upon arrival, I was informed that the army 
commander in charge of Muhamalai wanted 
to meet with me. During our conversation, 
he asked, both firmly and politely, why I had 
stayed in the LTTE-held area despite the 
government's order to evacuate. I explained 
that I was not willing to abandon my local 
workers.
Meanwhile, some Sinhala newspapers had

labelled me pro-LTTE and even accused me of 
training LTTE fighters. Despite my desire to 
continue working for the people of Sri Lanka, 
my mission grew concerned that the negative 
press could lead to attacks against me. 
Eventually, I was informed that my visa had 
been revoked, and I was given only five days 
to leave the country. I wrote a very polite 
letter to the then Defense Secretary, Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa, explaining my reasons for not 
being able to leave immediately. However, I 
later learned from my Sri Lankan friends that 
Gotabaya had ordered my expulsion. There 
were no interrogations, and I was able to leave 
the country peacefully.
You mentioned the forced enlistment 
by the LTTE. Could you elaborate on 
that?
The policy of the LTTE at the time I was in 
their territory was to require one member 
from each family to join their forces, regardless 
of gender. They forcefully enlisted everyone, 
and the majority of people did not want their 
daughters and sons to enlist. Some of the 
youths that the LTTE enlisted were the sole 
breadwinners of their families. 
One day, I received a message that one of 
my staff, a young girl, had been abducted by 
the LTTE's abduction team while she was at 
the market buying groceries for our NGO. 
I immediately went to the location, where I 
found a group of LTTE members surrounding 
her. I approached the chief of the group and 
asserted that she was under my supervision 
and they could not take her away. They were 
surprised by my opposition, as they rarely 
encountered resistance. They called their 
superior, and eventually, I was able to take 
her back with me. She was then forced to stay 
within our compound for a month. One day, 
the LTTE tried to enter our compound to take 
her away. After I left, I learned that the LTTE 
had abducted her again, but thankfully, she 
survived the war and is alive today.
 What war crimes did you observe 
committed by the Sri Lankan 
Government?
There were several instances. For example, the 
army's deep penetration unit, known as the 
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP), 
planted a claymore mine that targeted a van 
full of civilians; many civilians died, and I 
witnessed their bodies. They also bombed my 
house. Additionally, I witnessed numerous 
reckless aerial bombings that contributed to 
significant civilian casualties. These actions 
raised serious concerns about violations of 
international humanitarian law.
