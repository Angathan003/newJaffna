that lie ahead, Solheim calls for unity among 
Tamils, unwavering support for the 13th 
Amendment, and a collective push toward 
peace and prosperity. 
Erik, many recognize your name as 
soon as it's mentioned in Sri Lanka. 
Considering your prominent place in 
the collective memory here, do you 
see your connection to the country 
more as an honour, or do you feel it 
comes with specific responsibilities? 
How do you view your role in relation 
to Sri Lanka?
I definitely see my connection to Sri Lanka as 
both an honor and a responsibility. In the past, 
we dedicated considerable effort to mediate 
peace between the Sri Lankan government 
and the LTTE, which was an arduous task. 
This work allowed me to develop enduring

relationships with a diverse group of Tamils, 
Sinhalese, and Muslims throughout the 
country—relationships that are both deep and 
personal and that I continue to maintain.
Now, I feel a pressing responsibility to assist 
Sri Lanka in overcoming its economic and 
environmental challenges. Given that Sri 
Lanka often lacks sufficient international 
attention, I am committed to supporting the 
country and raising global awareness of its 
needs.
You've had a long-standing connection 
with Sri Lanka, beginning as a peace 
negotiator and enduring considerable 
criticism from various factions. 
Despite these challenges, you returned 
16 years later as an advisor to the 
President. What sparked your initial 
involvement with Sri Lanka, and what 
has motivated you to continue your 
engagement despite the criticisms?
My involvement, along with Norway's, in the 
Sri Lankan peace process began when both 
the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government 
recognized the need for a neutral third party to 
facilitate peace negotiations. Initially, President 
Chandrika Kumaratunga suggested France as 
a mediator, but the LTTE opposed this due 
to her French connections and proficiency in 
French.
The consensus was that a smaller, more distant 
country would be preferable to avoid the 
influence of major global powers like the US, 
China, or Japan. Norway was chosen due to its 
reputation for neutrality and peace advocacy, 
making us suitable mediators. Before this role, 
my primary regional knowledge was of India, 
with very little direct understanding of Sri 
Lanka.
As an advisor on climate change to 
President Ranil, you've undoubtedly 
felt the intense heat currently 
impacting Sri Lanka. What are your 
primary goals in this role, and what 
outcomes are you aiming to achieve 
with your portfolio?
The President recently launched the Tropical 
Nations Initiative, reflecting his focus on the 
tropical belt, which is disproportionately 
affected by climate change. While some 
northern countries might see benefits from 
slightly warmer climates in otherwise colder 
regions, tropical areas face severe challenges 
like escalated temperatures and more extreme 
weather events. For instance, tropical regions 
are prone to cyclones and flooding, similar to 
the recent events in Pakistan, as well as intense 
heat waves.
This initiative aims to address these issues 
head-on. The solutions are clear: we need to 
rapidly transition to renewable energy sources 
like solar and wind, promote electric vehicles, 
and enhance forest conservation. These actions 
are crucial for mitigating the impact of climate 
change on tropical nations.
You've mentioned having a strong 
working relationship with President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe and have 
spoken highly of his leadership. Given 
this, do you plan to endorse him in the 
upcoming election?
Of course, as a foreigner, I will not endorse any

Sri Lankan politician. It's appropriate for foreigners to respect 
and leave such decisions to the people of Sri Lanka. I am well-
acquainted with President Ranil Wickremesinghe from the 
peace process, and I believe he has performed remarkably 
in stabilizing the economy during a period of severe crisis 
marked by skyrocketing inflation and long queues for petrol. 
My aim is to support Sri Lanka, not to meddle in Sri Lanka's 
domestic politics. I am committed to working with 
whoever is elected, be it Ranil, Sajith Premadasa, Anura 
Kumara Dissanayake, or any other leader.
If there is a change in presidency, do you 
expect to continue in your current position?
A new administration may ask me and others 
to continue to support the nation. Indeed, my 
commitment is to Sri Lanka, not to any individual 
politician. I am eager to continue helping the country.
Given your extensive experience in 
environmental matters, how do you believe 
you can influence Sri Lanka's approach to 
environmental issues?
I hope to offer advice and share valuable knowledge from 
other parts of the world, particularly from India and China, 
two nations with which I frequently work. Both are rapidly 
advancing, especially in environmental technology. My goal is 
to help Sri Lanka view environmental and climate challenges 
as opportunities to create jobs and drive prosperity through 
green initiatives. Embracing green technologies can lead to 
significant job creation. For instance, China has been so 
successful in this regard that 60% of all green technologies in 
the world are now developed in China alone. It's far ahead 
of the West. When you purchase a Tesla electric car, the 
battery is likely made in China, which is half the car's 
value.
In India, Prime Minister Modi is swiftly advancing 
renewable energy projects, including green 
hydrogen. Plans are underway to introduce 
electric buses and cars, and investments in solar

energy, including floating solar parks, are 
occurring daily. Sri Lanka should also seek 
investment from and partnerships with the 
US and Europe. However, the most significant 
opportunities might come from India and 
China due to their competitive pricing. I am 
eager to facilitate this exchange of expertise 
and potentially help establish connections with 
companies interested in investing in Sri Lanka.
Are you suggesting that the Sri Lankan 
government should view environmental 
challenges as opportunities rather 
than problems?
Exactly. It's about integrating economic 
development with ecological protection. The 
old mindset that pits development against 
the environment is outdated. Today, the 
question is: How can we go green in a way 
that both creates jobs and ensures prosperity? 
This approach redefines progress, marrying 
economic growth with environmental 
sustainability.
What do you consider to be the most 
pressing environmental issues locally 
and globally at the moment?
Let's start with the local issues. I recently 
met with all the district commissioners from 
the Eastern Province, where we identified 
four major environmental opportunities. 
First, we're looking to expand solar energy 
through rooftop installations and larger solar 
plants. Second, there's a focus on protecting 
mangroves and forests, with efforts to 
secure international financial support for 
these habitats. Third, we aim to transform 
agriculture gradually into more sustainable 
practices, utilizing agricultural residues for 
biofuels rather than making abrupt changes 
like those attempted under Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa. Lastly, we are improving waste 
management to keep the Eastern Province 
cleaner, which will not only attract more 
tourists but also enhance the quality of life and 
health of local residents.

Despite the unfavourable outcomes, do 
you believe that Gotabaya Rajapaksa's 
intentions were good when he 
implemented the ban on chemical 
fertilizers and aimed for a 100% green 
agricultural policy using organic 
fertilizers?
Yes, I believe his intentions were good. He 
aimed to transform the environment and 
address Sri Lanka's debt issues. However, 
his methods were questionable, to say the 
least. You can't simply go to a farmer and 
say, 'Yesterday, you used chemical fertilizers, 
but starting today, you will adopt a different 
method.' That approach simply won't work. 
Transitioning to organic fertilizers is a long-
term process; it cannot be implemented in a 
single day. It should begin with one farmer 
who learns the new methods; from there, 
it should spread to others through mutual 
learning. That's how it should proceed.
How would you assess Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa's performance as 
President?

There can hardly be any doubt that his time as 
President was a failure. There was a massive 
movement against him from all sectors, 
religious groups, and ethnic communities 
across Sri Lanka. Tamils, Sinhalese, Muslims, 
the rich and poor, students and academics, 
workers and proprietors—everyone demanded 
his resignation. This was primarily due to 
his failed economic strategy. For instance, 
you cannot reduce taxes and simultaneously 
increase government spending—it simply 
doesn't add up. However, he was also unlucky, 
as he became President during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
Do you believe there were any foreign 
influences involved in the 2022 Sri 
Lankan protests, commonly referred to 
as Aragalaya?
No, that's a common but incorrect belief in 
Sri Lanka—that there is always someone or 
something behind everything. In my view, all 
the major powers—India, China, the United 
States, and Europe—share the same goal: a 
prosperous, rapidly developing Sri Lanka that 
is friendly to everyone. Of course, each nation, 
whether it's India or China, would prefer to 
have closer ties with Sri Lanka. However, 
overall, Sri Lanka can maintain friendly 
relations with everyone while still protecting 
its own interests. But I am certain there 
were no foreign hands behind the Aragalaya 
movement. It was a spontaneous movement by 
the people, driven by desperation due to the 
economic situation.
Who do you hold responsible for the 
breakdown of the ceasefire that you 
were actively negotiating?
I blame Prabhakaran for the end of the 
ceasefire. He ultimately chose to return 
to war, unable to commit to a federal 
settlement. Although he initially accepted 
the 'Oslo Declaration in 2002, which 
advocated federalism, he failed to uphold 
this commitment. Additionally, I hold the Sri 
Lankan state responsible, particularly due to 
the division between the SLFP and the UNP, 
the two major political parties at the time, 
which failed to unite for the greater purpose of 
Sri Lanka, above petty party politics.

What percentage of the blame do you 
assign to the LTTE and the Sri Lankan 
government for the breakdown of the 
ceasefire?
I prefer not to engage in this kind of judgment, 
even though I understand the question. It's 
difficult to assess all the factors from the past 
accurately. 
But Eric, you were directly involved in 
those negotiations, right?
Yes, I was the main negotiator, but it's 
important to consider the broader context. 
The book 'To End a Civil War: Norway's 
Peace Engagement in Sri Lanka' by Mark 
Salter resonates with my views. I understand 
the immense suffering experienced by many, 
especially the Tamil community, but also the 
Sinhalese who lost loved ones. There's a strong 
desire for clarity among those affected—they 
want to understand what happened, to confirm 
facts that allow them to honor their loved ones 
appropriately and move forward. For instance, 
a widow or someone who lost a spouse under 
unclear circumstances finds it very difficult 
to move on without that closure. Therefore, 
we should focus on shedding light on what 
happened rather than passing judgment on 
every act of the past.
You've faced significant criticism from 
various factions over time. Sinhala 
nationalist parties have accused 
you of sympathizing with the LTTE, 
while some staunch LTTE supporters 
blame you for the group's failures 
On April 29, 2009, in Colombo, a Sri Lankan army trooper passes by posters accusing British Foreign Minister David Miliband, US 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Norwegian International Development Minister Erik Solheim of supporting terrorism in Sri 
Lanka. The country continued to resist global demands for a ceasefire, aimed at allowing civilians to escape from the conflict zone 
to safety.

even after the war's conclusion. How 
do you respond to these accusations, 
especially given that you initially 
engaged in the peace process with 
positive intentions?
I think it's quite normal. When you attempt 
to make peace, criticism is inevitable. This is 
true for peacemakers in every conflict. I was 
also involved in Nepal, Sudan, and Myanmar. 
Critics often target those striving for peace 
because peace requires compromise. If you 
aim for a 100% win, peace is unattainable; only 
a military victory is possible, and people are 
generally unhappy with compromises. Thus, 
criticism follows. 
Indeed, during the war, we were mainly 
criticized by Sinhala hardliners who accused 
us of being too lenient with Prabhakaran and 
overly supportive of the LTTE. Whenever 
the LTTE appeared on TV, I was often seen 
alongside Prabhakaran or Anton Balasingham. 
After the war, some Tamil extremists have 
similarly claimed that I was responsible for the 
death of Prabhakaran.
 I've been very happy since returning. Now, 
aside from a few extremists, the vast majority 
of Sri Lankans, both Tamil and Sinhalese, have 
welcomed me with open arms.
You are one of the very few people 
who have met Prabhakaran frequently.
Indeed, I believe I am the foreigner who met 
him most frequently.
How do you perceive him as a person, 
a military commander, and a leader?
As a military commander, he was enormously 
successful for a very long time, building 
this strong political movement and massive 
military machinery. He entered the peace 
process at the peak of his power, signing for 
peace while still very influential. However, 
in the last three years of the war, I can 
see only mistakes from Prabhakaran. He 
believed he could fight the Sri Lankan army 
as a conventional force. He was pushed from 
one defensive position to another, never 
reaching out for any compromise, settlement, 
or solution, and taking thousands of Tamils 
with him into peril. Toward the end of the 
war, we offered Prabhakaran the opportunity 
for all the Tamils and the Tiger cadres to be 
evacuated from the Mullaitivu region, where 
tens of thousands of Tamils were trapped. 
We proposed that all LTTE cadres and Tamil 
civilians be taken out of the war zone by ship.  
To where...?
To the rest of Sri Lanka, including Colombo, 
or possibly to other countries where they 
might receive political asylum. Our proposed 
plan included registering every LTTE cadre 
and civilian. This would make it much more 
difficult to harm or kill them, as international 
entities would be involved in the registration 
process. Initially, Prabhakaran said that he 
would accept this offer, but ultimately, he 
refused
When this happened.. which month...?
It was April 2009. We tried to ensure a 
process to make sure that their lives were all 
saved through the registration process and 
evacuation by ship from the east coast. The 
UN Secretary-General at the time, Ban Ki-
moon, was ready to support it, even to visit the 
LTTE. I was, of course, ready to go to agree

with Prabhakaran. We had backing from India 
and the United States. There was international 
support to save the lives of all the Tamil 
civilians and LTTE cadres, but Prabhakaran 
sadly at the end refused.
 So what was Prabhakaran's plan? 
I cannot judge his plan. I don't think I would 
speculate on that. 
When did you realize that the LTTE 
might be defeated?
India, with its extensive intelligence 
capabilities in Sri Lanka, consistently 
advocated for a negotiated peace, maintaining 
that a military victory was impossible. 
However, from 2008 onwards, their stance 
began to shift. Top Indian national security 
officials indicated that the Sri Lankan army 
had made significant progress on the ground. 
The capture of Kilinochchi by government 
forces was a very strong sign that a military 
victory, previously deemed unattainable, might 
now be within reach. Indian intelligence, 
which had numerous methods for monitoring 
the situation, informed us that the Sri Lankan 
government might indeed achieve a military 
victory.
Do you believe that both parties, the 
LTTE and the military, committed war 
crimes?
Yes, it is absolutely clear that there were war 
crimes committed by both sides. However, 
I will refrain from judging individuals or 
specific incidents. But there's no doubt in my 
mind about the occurrence of these crimes.
 Erik, do you view the LTTE 
predominantly as freedom fighters 
or as a terrorist organization? I'm

asking for your personal 
view now, not your stance 
during the negotiations.
 I really don't want to delve into 
judgments, but it must be noted 
that, at the time, there was no 
doubt that the LTTE received 
substantial support from the 
Tamil community in Sri Lanka. 
Sometimes, this support might 
have been coerced, due to 
strong-arm tactics and behavior. 
However, it is also undeniable 
that the vast majority of Tamils, 
both in the diaspora and within 
Sri Lanka, supported the LTTE 
at that time.
Do you believe that the 
LTTE was genuinely 
committed to peace 
when they entered into 
negotiations?
The LTTE initiated the peace 
process at the peak of its power, 
not when they were weak, as 
some claim. In fact, the LTTE 
was never as strong as it was 
in 2001, which is exactly when 
the peace process began. I see 
this as a clear signal that, at 
that time, they were interested 
in exploring peaceful means to 
resolve the conflict. Why else 
would you start a peace process 
when you are at your strongest? 
You mentioned in 
an interview that if 
Prabhakaran had listened to Anton Balasingam, 
the situation for Sri Lankan Tamils might have 
been better. Can you elaborate on that?
Absolutely. Bala, as we all called him, advised against several 
poor decisions made by the LTTE leadership.
Did he mention any specific mistakes made by the 
LTTE leadership to you?
Absolutely.

What mistakes did he mention?
For instance, he mentioned that the killing 
of Rajiv Gandhi was a huge mistake. He 
also pointed out that the LTTE weakened 
significantly after the split with Karuna and 
the eastern fighters and was very worried 
about the effect of the split on the LTTE. Bala 
resolutely accepted federalism.
You are a close friend of President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe. Do you believe 
that he will grant some form of power 
to the Tamils?
I absolutely believe that Ranil's intention is to 
find a solution based on the 13th Amendment. 
This Amendment supports the devolution of 
power to the Tamils. However, this process is 
not straightforward. The struggle of the Tamils 
did not end with the LTTE. It will continue in 
civilian, non-violent forms and address issues 
such as land disputes and temple controversies. 
The Tamil community of course must stand up 
and speak out. It should unite in support of the 
13th Amendment. You don't get anything for 
free; you must defend your rights.  
Though the LTTE was militarily 
defeated, the underlying reasons why 
the Tamils began their struggle remain 
unchanged—the same problems still 
exist. As a friend and advisor to Sri 
Lanka, what advice would you give to 
the Sri Lankan government?
 Now, I firmly believe that the 13th 
Amendment is a crucial step forward for the 
Tamil quest in Sri Lanka. It is essential for 
Tamils to unite and support this Amendment 
and for the Sri Lankan government to fully 
implement it. Additionally, all communities 
should contribute to the country's economic 
growth. I recall that back in the 1950s, Jaffna 
was the most developed region in Sri Lanka. 
However, many Tamils have since left the 
north and east. The diaspora Tamils, who 
have achieved immense success abroad, 
should also support Sri Lanka's economic 
development. This collective effort will benefit 
all communities.
As you mentioned, the diaspora is a 
significant force. What advice would 
you give to them?
The most important advice for the diaspora 
is to invest more in Sri Lanka. Many of them 
are very affluent. I often invite some of my 
Tamil friends to my tiny apartment in Norway, 
and they ask me, 'How can you live here? Our 
houses are much bigger.' They are that affluent. 
I encourage them to use their expertise to 
set up companies, invest in business in the 
homeland, and establish small hotels. This 
would be a significant help. 
The Sri Lankan government should also play 
a major role in making this process easier. The 
diaspora Tamils must also understand that 
the leadership for Sri Lankan Tamils is based 
here, not abroad. Sometimes, you may hear 
diaspora people calling for violent attacks or 
similar actions, but they are not the ones who 
will suffer. They would sit safely abroad while 
the suffering remains with the people who live 
here in Sri Lanka. They must leave the main 
decisions to the Tamils on the ground.
