S
ri Lanka has officially 
announced its 15-man squad 
for the upcoming 2024 T20 World 
Cup, blending young prospects 
with seasoned veterans. The team 
will be led by Wanidu Hasaranga, 
who is currently recovering from 
a heel injury sustained before the 
IPL season. Despite not bowling 
yet, Hasaranga has been actively 
participating in practice matches to 
regain his form.
Among the newcomers, Dunith 
Wellalage, a left-arm spinning 
all-rounder, has been included 
despite having no prior experience 
in T20 internationals. His 
selection comes on the back of 
potential impact considerations 
in the tournament. Other notable 
inclusions are Kamindu Mendis 
and Nuwan Thushara, the latter 
making headlines with a recent 
performance that included a hat-
trick and a total of five wickets for 
20 runs.

star who recently showcased his talents in the 
IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad, will be traveling 
with the team as part of the reserves.
The batting lineup appears robust, with 
Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis expected 
to open, followed by Kamindu Mendis, 
Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, 
and the experienced Angelo Mathews. This 
lineup is designed to provide stability and 
explosive power, which is crucial for the fast-
paced T20 format.
On the bowling front, the competition 
remains fierce. Dushmantha Chameera is 
likely to lead the pace attack, but he will face 
stiff competition from Thushara, Matheesha 
Pathirana, and Dilshan Madushanka. In the 
spin department, captain Hasaranga and 
Mahesh Theekshana are set to be the go-to 
options, providing both control and wicket-
taking ability.
Veterans like Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de 
Silva, and Dasun Shanaka also return, bringing 
invaluable experience and depth to the squad. 
Their presence will be critical in navigating 
high-pressure situations throughout the 
tournament.
Sri Lanka finds itself in Group D alongside 
Bangladesh, Nepal, the Netherlands, and South 
Africa. The team will kick off its campaign 
on June 3 in New York against South Africa, 
followed by a match against Bangladesh in 
Dallas on June 8. Their journey will continue 
with games against Nepal and the Netherlands 
in Florida and St. Lucia, respectively.

Captain: Wanidu Hasaranga
Vice-Captain: Charith Asalanka
Players: Kusal Mendis, Pathum Nissanka,
