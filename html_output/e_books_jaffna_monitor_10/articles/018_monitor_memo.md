P
resident Anura Kumara Dissanayake has 
expressed that political parties in the 
Northern Province are prepared to collaborate 
with the government after the upcoming 
parliamentary election. Speaking at a gathering 
of National People’s Power (NPP) candidates at 
the Grand Monarch Hotel in Thalawathugoda, 
he underscored the significance of the 
forthcoming election, describing it as a crucial 
opportunity to rid the parliament of allegations 
and accusations.
He highlighted that during recent discussions 
with a key northern political leader, it was 
mentioned that the people of the region 
are willing to work with the government. 
"The upcoming parliamentary election on 
November 14th presents an opportunity for 
us to secure the strong political power needed 
to make critical decisions for the country," 
Dissanayake said.
He stressed the need for a parliament that is 
not only representative but also capable of 
efficiently utilizing resources. "Unfortunately, 
parliament has been branded as a place that 
squanders public resources. We need to change 
that perception," the president added.
However, behind these public remarks, recent 
meetings between President Dissanayake 
and two key leaders of the Ilankai Tamil 
Arasu Katchi (ITAK)—S. Sritharan and M.A. 
Sumanthiran—have sparked local speculation 
about their true motives. According to sources 
in Jaffna, Sritharan may have met with the 
president to request that the names of bar 
license holders, granted by the previous 
government under Ranil Wickremesinghe, 
remain undisclosed—due to concerns that 
such revelations could implicate him or his 
associates.
In contrast, sources claim that Sumanthiran’s 
meeting may have had the opposite objective: 
he allegedly urged the president to release 
these names, aiming to expose his intra-party 
rival Sritharan, whose name is rumored to be 
on the list.
While President Dissanayake emphasized 
unity and collaboration in his speech, the 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering by northern 
political figures paints a far more complex 
picture.

F
our years ago, former Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA) MP Saravanapavan 
visited Colombo to gift Jaffna mangoes to 
then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Now, 
just days ago, he appeared before former 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) leader 
Mavai Senathirajah, once again with a basket 
of mangoes. This time, he sought Mavai's 
blessings for a new party that he and his allies, 
who were denied the chance to contest under 
ITAK, have launched ahead of the upcoming 
election. Mavai, whose political appetite seems 
to have waned, smiled innocently at those who 
approached him, unsure whether the mangoes 
were sweet or sour.
Much like the mango that caused the famous 
sibling rivalry between Murugan and Ganesha, 
the fruit seems to be at the center of a political 
sibling rivalry between the Ilankai Tamil

Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) and the newly formed 
Democratic Ilankai Tamil Arasu alliance. 
Whether this mango will offer a harmonious 
resolution to their election struggles remains 
to be seen, but one thing is clear: the tradition 
of "Mango Diplomacy" is not to be dismissed 
lightly.
From Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan 
Singh, Indian leaders have trusted in the 
power of mango diplomacy, using it to 
accomplish significant political feats. In the 
2000s, when the United States banned Indian 
mango imports, then-President George W. 
Bush visited New Delhi. Manmohan Singh, 
determined to resolve the mango matter, 
personally served Bush a mango, convincing 
him to lift the ban. In return, Singh agreed 
to allow the import of Harley-Davidson 
motorcycles into India, which had been 
restricted until then. This historical context 
sheds light on the enduring power of mango 
diplomacy.
Pakistan, too, has long upheld the tradition 
of gifting mangoes to foreign leaders. Former 
Prime Minister Zia-ul-Haq once sent the 
delicious Rataul mangoes to Indira Gandhi, 
signaling a desire for improved relations with 
India. However, after Indira's time, India 
grew skeptical of these offerings. The attitude 
became: "You can't bomb us on one hand and 
send mangoes on the other," and they would 
turn away from such gestures.
In 2015, then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
sent 10 kilos of mangoes each not only to 
Narendra Modi but also to former Prime 
Ministers Manmohan Singh, Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee, and President Pranab Mukherjee. 
India, though appreciative of the sweet gift, 
didn't let it soften its stance.
Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh 
Hasina is another notable fan of mango 
diplomacy. She would often send mangoes 
to Indian state leaders. The year after 
Saravanabhavan gave mangoes to Mahinda, 
Sheikh Hasina also sent a batch to Mahinda 
with affection.
While South Asian leaders have exchanged 
plates of mangoes over the years, such gestures 
carried much more value when gifted to 
the West. Western leaders not only received 
these mangoes with great appreciation, but 
sometimes even needed lessons on how to eat 
them! A former UN Secretary-General once 
remarked, "Indian leaders keep sending me 
mangoes, but I have no idea how to eat them 
properly."
Thus, while the newly formed Democratic 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu alliance or the actions of 
its members may seem politically insignificant 
today, the historical and diplomatic value of 
the mango, their chosen symbol, is undeniable.
Fruit for thought!
Mahinda Rajapaksa

Story
The sky was gradually growing darker. The wind 
swirled and howled. The blue waves, folding and 
foaming, crashed against the shore and retreated.
He, along with Nandakumār and Poṉṉuthurai, was 
sitting on a branch of a seaside screewpalm tree that 
dipped towards the sea. He was completely lost in 
thought. A certain joy bubbled up, breaching the bounds 
of his heart. A joy that could not be captured in words. 
He was immersed in those feelings, drawing a tapestry 
of melodies in his heart, mumbling something in an 
attempt to give voice to this tapestry. His mind dwelled 
on the melodic shifts of his mumbling and realized that

those variations exquisitely 
captured his joy in a way 
that words could not. 
Enveloped in his bliss, he 
forgot his surroundings and 
became one with nature.
He reflected on the life of a 
river, born in the mountain, 
culminating in the sea. 
When it encountered 
vertical cliff drops, it fell 
like streaks of diamonds, 
shattered like silver beads, 
and then reunited, with the 
magical incantation, ‘Ōm,’ 
into a whole. Through the 
forests bearing flowers, it 
crawled like a smiling little 
baby. It bumped and crashed 
into rocks, swirling and 
flowing on ferociously. It 
entered the fields in villages 
and ran in rings, frolicking. 
When it reached its point 
of confluence, it calmly 
merged into the sea, like a 
hermit who had given up all 
worldly bonds and desires.
He imagined the lively 
movements of the river as 
melodies. The river flowed 
within the ups and downs 
of the melodic variations 
in his heart. It made music 
like a waterfall. Bearing 
flowers, its laughter tinkled. 
It roared, pounding on to 
the rocks. Finally, it became 
silent with the sea. He 
reveled in his joy. He felt 
as if he was soaring high in 
the sky. His body became 
weightless like a bundle of 
cotton wool. He felt the urge to sing aloud. He wanted to roll 
around on the moist green cover of the screewpalm leaves. 
He wanted to jump with joy on the moist crystalline sand that 
reflected the colors of the sky, and dance as the waves retreated 
back into the sea. Eventually, he felt dizzy and faint.
He held fast to the branch of the screewpalm tree to steady 
himself. Extricating himself from his poetic reverie, he 
regarded his friends. Nandakumār was immersed in some story 
in a Tamil magazine. He was holding the magazine in his right 
hand, while his left was unconsciously ruffling through his hair. 
His face was serene. He looked very handsome in this pose. 
The budding pencil mustache gave him a particular radiance.
Poṉṉuthurai was sitting at the top of the branch, his feet 
swinging freely below him. Holding the branch with one hand, 
he was savoring the smell of a withered screewpalm flower.
Time crawled. A southbound train sped along the seaside 
tracks. The green screewpalm leaves, dappled by the yellow 
evening sunlight, shimmered, glittering through the foaming 
white waves. A young girl of twelve or thirteen, at the cusp of 
womanhood, was frolicking on the beach, keeping up with the

advance and retreat of the waves.
He delighted in the beauty around him. He 
thought that the soul of the universe manifests 
in beauty like this. Musical montages 
pervaded his heart, like a fresh spring gushing 
forth; like a vibrant multi-coloured sparkler 
that pours green, red, blue, and yellow; like a 
grand park pulsating with life in the Spring; 
like the flocks of birds that rise from the 
paddy fields at dusk. They gently caressed 
his heart and blossomed into mumblings and 
scattered.
He thought about her, her warmth of her 
sideways glance, the elegance of her gait, 
the charm of her smile, the sweet majesty 
of her voice that emerges from the depth of 
her heart, the easy grace with which she gets 
along with everyone.
Overcome with emotion, he suddenly turned 
to his friends and said:
“The genesis of art is based on the 
appreciation of beauty. It is the allure of 
beauty that enchants the human heart and 
triggers the emotional outburst that leads to 
the creation of art. What do you think?”
A soft, gentle smile appeared on 
Poṉṉuthurai’s face.
Nandakumār lifted his eyes up from his 
magazine, hesitated for a moment, and then 
twirling the ring on his right ring finger with 
his left hand said:
“I cannot accept the argument that beauty is 
the basis of art. Emotional turmoil and sorrow 
have also engendered great art!”
He interrupted Nandakumār, “That is true; 
but it is only when a person is full of joy that 
their emotions bubble over the brim. Ancient 
humans produced art only when they were 
joyful. Was not every art form, be it dance, 
music, painting, or sculpture, the expression 
of some emotion? Is it not so, even now?”

“That is exactly what I said. 
Appreciation of beauty is 
not the basis of art. The 
expression of all nine 
types of emotions, like joy, 
suffering, sorrow, happiness, 
and so on, is the basis of 
art,” Nandakumār said as he 
flipped through the pages of 
his magazine, reflecting on 
what he had just said.
Poṉṉuthurai, who was silent 
until then, hopped off the 
branch, planted his feet 
firmly on the ground and 
leaned on the branch. He 
folded his arms across his 
chest, smiled and said in a 
booming voice:
“You say that art is the 
expression of emotions. 
I daresay that the best art 
is that which expresses 
society’s emotions. They 
are the ones that will hasten 
social development. They 
are the ones that will nudge 
the oppressed, who suffer 
like slaves under the yoke of 
society, into reflecting about 
their plights, and catalyze 
them into struggling for 
equality in society. I will 
say that the laments of 
those who suffer under the 
oppressive social structures 
of today should be the 
weft of creative art. Just 
focusing on personal human 
emotions and sorrows only 
serve to distract and destroy 
attempts to reform society.”
“I cannot accept this argument. Neither the struggle for basic 
needs like food and clothing nor victories in those struggles 
constitute social development. Meeting all the basic needs and 
beyond, and the distraction of creature comforts in life, do not 
constitute an ideal life either. There should be a meaning to life, 
my friend. Struggling for food and clothing is not the meaning 
of life.”
Nandakumār was listening quietly to both arguments while 
looking at the round-faced beauty on the cover of his magazine.
The waves in the sea roared.
Poṉṉuthurai usually roared with righteous indignation like 
a tumultuous sea whenever he talked about societal ills. But 
that day, he was very calm. He said, with determination, and 
a hint of sarcasm, in his voice, “A man who is denied food 
and clothing must need to think about food and clothing; the 
meaning of his life is the satisfaction he derives from food and 
clothing; if he cannot eat, there is no life for him.”
He remained silent, rocking the branch back and forth by 
rhythmically pushing against a big rock, staring at the horizon.

He was watching the blazing red globe of a 
sun set into the sea.
Dark clouds were dispersing.
He was deep in thought, pondering the 
meaning of life. He marveled at the magic of 
creation, wondering what puzzle lay behind its 
secret. “How many living beings; How many 
kinds of grass and weeds; How many trees; 
How many bushes and creepers; How many 
birds; How many creatures; How many types 
of people; How much beauty,” he thought, 
amazed.
‘This life is a struggle. The world revolves 
around the struggle between the strong and 
the weak. Creation itself has produced the 
strong and the weak and is spectating the 
ensuing struggle between them. Sometimes 
the survival of one depends on the destruction 
of the other. When destruction leads to sorrow, 
this entire world glistens in its sadness,’ he 
thought.
Poṉṉuthurai was deep in thought, leaning on 
the branch with his hands folded across his 
chest. Nandakumār, holding the rolled-up 
magazine in his right hand, spread his legs 
wide, bent over as if he was searching for 
something on the ground, below his legs.
He looked at them and said softly, “The 
struggle between the strong and the week, and 
the struggle between humanity and nature, 
are the forces driving the evolution of human 
civilization; They are authentic and inevitable; 
How many people lack food, clothing, and 
other essential needs, and are exploited by 
others; It is true that creating art about them 
can make them ponder their fate, and thus lead 
to their emancipation; But that is no reason 
to assert that art must be concerned only with 
their plight. The beauty, sorrow, and the ups 
and downs of all creation can also be made 
into art.
He hesitated for a moment, and continued in 
his soft, refined voice.

“External struggles are inevitable; Art must 
explore them; But one must not argue that 
aspects of the internal life of the human mind 
is off topic for art. The beauty that humans 
see in nature, the empathy they feel with the 
naturally deprived and the disadvantaged, 
their inherent sorrow they see in destruction, 
their yearning to appreciate beauty, and the 
resulting anguish and disappointment, all 
certainly lead to exquisite art. This is what we 
see in the ruins of ancient civilizations.”
They were silent.
Time crawled.
The silence hung heavily among them.
He waited for them to say something but 
could see from their facial expressions that 
they would not. He stared at the expanse of 
the sky through the gaps in the screewpalm 
branches towards the northeast.
A yellow electric lamp whimpered on top of 
the tall pillar that rose from the southern wall 
of the railway station. Two crows sat on the 
iron grill supporting the lamp. It looked like 
a signal post. Behind them, in the railway 
station building, the roof ridge that ran in the 
east-west direction was bookended by two 
sharp, erect poles that reflected the traditional 
architectural style.
He closed his eyes.
A melody that carried the essence of suffering 
emerged as mumblings from his mouth.
He reflected on the atrocities of this societal 
life. This society, which insists on repeatedly 
wailing loudly about ethics, morality, justice, 
religions, and beliefs, nevertheless carries 
on its unethical, immoral, unjust, faith-
destroying march. The bulk of this society 
has transmogrified into a fertile ground for 
unethical life, a sacrificial altar for justice and 
faith. But the righteous sermons continue…
One can be immoral while admitting being 
immoral or destroy justice and faith while 
acknowledging doing so. That would be 
better, he thought.
He was truly enchanted by her beauty, its 
bewitching charm, and its elegance. He had 
complete trust in her and his friends. After 
she declared, “You and I are one. The essence 
of my life is in living it with you,” he had 
wholeheartedly allowed her to socialize with 
his friends.
She could have told him, “I like your friend 
better than you.”
He could have tried to make me understand, 
“Machān, she loves me – I love her, too.”
He mumbled to himself, ‘When I see morality 
and faith being destroyed, I am overcome 
with emotion, anger, self-pity, and hurt.’
Through the screewpalm branches, the night 
smiled where the sea and the sky united on 
the western horizon. Dark clouds gathered, 
chasing one another.
They jumped off the screewpalm branch and 
walked away.
He followed his friends, intently watching 
their footprints forming in the moist beach 
sand; He walked mumbling that painful 
melody.
