S
hanakiyan Rasamanickam, the 
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK) lead candidate of Batticaloa 
district and former Member of 
Parliament, delivered yet another 
one of his signature naïve political 
speeches recently. This time, he boldly 
claimed that only those with squeaky 
clean records—free from abductions 
and killings—are contesting under 
the ITAK banner in the upcoming 
parliamentary elections.

Shanakiyan's "Selective 
Amnesia" Shines in 
Latest Speech
Shanakiyan Rasamanickam
He went further, throwing shade at other parties for 
fielding candidates with murky pasts. But in a classic 
Shanakiyan move, he somehow "forgot" to mention 
his own fascinating history of collaborating with, 
well... exactly the kind of people he's now opposing.
Let's rewind for a second. In his last election, 
Shanakiyan proudly stood with the Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA), where ITAK was the chief 
constituent. The TNA lineup wasn't exactly a roster 
of angels.

Alongside ITAK, there were former militant 
outfits like the Eelam People's Revolutionary 
Liberation Front (EPRLF), People's Liberation 
Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), 
and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization 
(TELO)—all known for widespread killings 
and abductions. Yes, the very same activities 
Shanakiyan is suddenly so horrified by.
If that wasn't enough of a contradiction to 
keep the political theater entertaining, in 2015, 
our dear Shanakiyan was actually a candidate 
for the United People's Freedom Alliance 
(UPFA)—under the leadership of none other 
than Mahinda Rajapaksa, a man not exactly 
famous for his gentle hugs or peacemaking 
skills.
Speaking at a media briefing and candidate 
introduction event held in Kallady, Batticaloa, 
Shanakiyan Rasamanickam proudly 
announced that ITAK has 'suddenly' taken a 
principled stand by selecting candidates who 
have not engaged in any unsavory activities 
like murder, abduction, or betrayal. The event 
was organized to introduce ITAK's "newly 
reformed" candidates for the Batticaloa 
District in the upcoming elections.
"Compared to the Tamil candidates from other 
parties in Batticaloa, it is widely recognized 
that our candidates are of a higher caliber. Our 
candidates are individuals who have no record 
of corruption or fraud, unlike those fielded by 
other parties."
Shanakiyan criticized rival parties, accusing 
them of nominating individuals with tainted 
histories. "Candidates from other parties 
who have been involved in corruption, fraud, 
and land grabbing are now being fielded to 
contest the elections. Only those who have not 
committed murder, abduction, or betrayals are 
running under the ITAK symbol," he added.
The former MP also noted that other major 
political parties, such as the United National 
Party (UNP) and the National People's Power 
(NPP), have fielded candidates from multiple 
ethnic backgrounds, which he suggested 
dilutes their focus on Tamil issues.
"This time, only two of our previous candidates 
are contesting, while six fresh faces have been 
introduced to the field. This demonstrates 
our commitment to renewing our party's 
representation with clean and capable 
individuals," Shanakiyan proudly stated. Of 
course, he conveniently skipped over the part 
where the previous candidates, who were 
critical of his political boss, Sumanthiran, were 
quietly sidelined. That's the real reason they 
could only accommodate two of the old guard.
He went on to criticize, saying, "One candidate, 
who previously stated this would be their last 
election, spent most of their extended term in 
London and has now re-entered the contest." 
This remark was clearly aimed at his former 
TNA ally and vocal critic, MP Govinthan 
Karunakaran, also known as Jana of TELO.
Shanakiyan underscored his own record, 
stating, "I am the only candidate from ITAK 
who has consistently worked on development 
projects across all areas of the Batticaloa 
District. We are now working tirelessly to 
secure four parliamentary seats for ITAK in 
this election."
While the Batticaloa District remains a key 
battleground in the upcoming elections, and 
Shanakiyan's campaign promises to focus on 
clean governance and development for the 
Tamil people, he conveniently glossed over the 
specifics. He failed to elaborate on what exactly 
this "clean governance" and "development" 
from ITAK MPs has accomplished over the 
years. Perhaps they are so clean that they've left 
no trace at all. Maybe. Who knows?
