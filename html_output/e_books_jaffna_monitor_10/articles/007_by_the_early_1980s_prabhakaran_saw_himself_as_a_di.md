hinniah Rajeshkumar, better 
known as Ragavan, is a key 
figure in the history of the LTTE 
and the Tamil liberation movement. 
As a co-founder of the LTTE and 
a close confidant of its notorious 
leader, Prabhakaran, Ragavan 
was instrumental in shaping the 
movement's early years. However, 
by April 1984, disillusioned by 
the rising extremism, senseless 
violence, internal power struggles, 
and the cult-like devotion to 
Prabhakaran, Ragavan made the 
fateful decision to sever ties with 
the LTTE and relocate to London.

Now a legal advisor and activist, Ragavan 
remains a crucial voice in discussions 
surrounding Tamil nationalism. In this 
exclusive interview with Jaffna Monitor, 
Ragavan not only shares insights that only 
someone with his insider experience can 
provide but also offers his views on the current 
political landscape. Due to space constraints, 
we will be publishing this compelling interview 
in parts—each segment offering a deeper 
glimpse into the tumultuous journey of the 
LTTE, the man who walked away from it, his 
once-close friend Prabhakaran, and much 
more.
As one of the founding members of the 
LTTE, you became involved in militant 
activities at a very young age. Could you 
describe the moment or circumstances 
that led you to conclude that armed 
struggle was the only viable path 
forward? What were the key factors that 
influenced your decision?
That was simply the reality of the times. Born 
in 1956, I had just completed my O/Levels in 
the early 1970s. During this period, two or 
three significant issues emerged that convinced 
many of us that armed struggle seemed to be 
the only path forward. I came from a middle-
class family in Punnalaikkadduvan, a rural 
village in Jaffna, where my parents, both school 
teachers, were well-known for their discipline 
and innocence. At that time, I didn't hold 
particularly strong political views nor had 
much understanding of the broader political 
landscape. While it is true that injustices were 
being committed against the Tamil community 
during my youth, it would be inaccurate to say 
that the entire youth population of Jaffna rose 
up in response.  
Two major factors influenced our decision to 
take up arms: the standardization of university 
admissions introduced in 1971 and the 1972 
Constitution. After the United Front (UF) 
government, led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike 
and comprising the Sri Lanka Freedom Party 
(SLFP), the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), 
and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, came 
to power, they introduced a new constitution, 
making Sri Lanka a republic. While this was 
seen as a break from the colonial past, the 
Constitution removed the protections for 
minorities that had been granted under the 
1947 Constitution. Sinhala was established as 
the sole official language, and Buddhism was 
given constitutional prominence. This deeply 
angered Tamil youth like us.  
Additionally, the standardization policy 
of 1971 drastically reduced the number of 
students from Jaffna who could gain admission 
to universities. There was a sense of pride in 
the North, particularly among the middle 
class, who viewed themselves as highly 
educated, a "machine" producing doctors and 
engineers. The standardization policy shattered 
that pride. Initially, the policy was based 
on language rather than region or district, 
which was perceived as a serious injustice. 
Later, it was shifted to a district-based system, 
somewhat akin to India's reservation system, 
where backward areas were given priority.
However, this shift, aimed at social justice by 
providing quotas for university admissions to 
underprivileged districts, was not welcomed 
by Tamil nationalists. They continued to frame 
the policy as discriminatory against Tamils. In 
reality, Tamils from the East, Mannar, Vanni, 
and the Malayagam benefited from the quota 
system, but this was largely overlooked in 
the Jaffna-centered Tamil nationalist political 
discourse. 
During this period, Sathyaseelan, a university 
student and the leader of the Tamil Student 
Federation (Tamil Manavar Peravai), 
led an opposition movement against the

standardization policy. Protests were organized 
in Jaffna, and even schoolgirls participated. 
One memorable slogan targeted the then-
Education Minister, Badi-ud-din Mahmud, 
mocking him for allegedly not knowing 
the basics of "alpha" and "beta." This slogan 
reflected the deep resentment of the middle 
class.
The situation escalated further with the 1974 
Tamil Conference incident, which fueled 
the growing discontent. The Sri Lankan 
government, concerned that holding the 
conference in Jaffna would promote Tamil 
nationalist politics, suggested moving the 
event to Colombo. While the conference was 
academic in nature, there was widespread 
enthusiasm among Tamils about hosting it in 
Jaffna. Ultimately, the organizing committee 
decided to proceed with Jaffna as the venue.
On January 10, 1974, the final day's event drew 
thousands of attendees and was held under a 
verbal agreement with the police. However, 
tensions escalated when the police, armed with 
weapons and tear gas, attempted to force their 
way through the densely packed crowd but 
were unable to proceed. In response, they fired 
tear gas and used force to disperse the crowd.
During this chaos, shots were fired into the 
air, causing a power line to snap, tragically 
electrocuting several people and resulting 
in seven fatalities. Though the police did 
not directly fire at the crowd, the deaths and 
injuries were a direct consequence of their 
excessive use of force.
In the early 1970s, Tamil activists like 
Sathiyaseelan and Sivakumaran began 
advocating that the only solution to the 
growing injustices was the creation of Tamil 
Eelam—a state governed by Tamils.
This, in many ways, laid the foundation for 
what would follow. Under Sathiyaseelan's 
leadership, the Student Federation aimed 
to "weed out" individuals perceived as 
collaborators with the government, a process 
they referred to as "kalaiyetuttal" (literally 
meaning "weeding out").
When the 1972 Constitution was 
implemented, protests were organized by the 
Tamil United Front (TUF). In a symbolic act 
of protest, Chelvanayagam resigned from his 
parliamentary seat in October 1972. During 
this period, 42 youths, including Sathiyaseelan 
from the Student Federation, were arrested 
and detained without trial for advocating that 
Tamil Eelam was the only solution and for 
engaging in acts of violence.
I, too, became involved in small acts of 
resistance, such as displaying black flags in 
protest, despite still being in my teenage years. 
While these were symbolic gestures, they 
reflected the growing discontent and marked 
the shift toward more militant forms of 
opposition.
Leaders of the Tamil Arasu Katchi, such 
as Kasi Ananthan, channelled the youth's 
anger—particularly the outrage sparked by 
the 1974 Tamil Conference incident—towards 
figures like Alfred Duraiappah, the then-
Mayor of Jaffna. Unable to defeat Duraiappah 
through elections, the Tamil nationalists 
blamed him for the violence at the conference 
despite evidence showing he had no direct 
or indirect involvement with the police 
violence on January 10, 1974. Nonetheless, a 
disinformation campaign by Tamil nationalist 
leaders portrayed Duraiappah as the 
mastermind behind the incident.
Through their speeches, these leaders subtly 
insinuated that individuals like Duraiappah 
would not die a natural death, effectively 
branding him a traitor in the eyes of the

Jaffna Monitor

12
youth. While the student leaders had not 
yet engaged in significant actions, they 
embraced the radical ideology that traitors 
must be eliminated. This notion was fueled 
by the rhetoric of Tamil leaders, who stirred 
these sentiments among the youth with their 
influence and speeches.
At the time, I, too, subscribed to the Tamil 
nationalist misinformation and ideology, 
believing that Duraiappah was a traitor who 
deserved to be eliminated.
What was the presence of the military 
like in Jaffna during that time?
At that time, seeing military personnel on the 
streets of Jaffna was quite rare. On the odd 
occasion, soldiers might come into town to 
buy cigarettes or other essentials from the 
local shops. If my memory serves me correctly, 
there were likely no more than 150 soldiers 
stationed at the Palaly army camp, though 
even that number is uncertain. The Sri Lankan 
military was more of a ceremonial force in 
those days, primarily involved in disaster relief 
during floods or participating in Republic Day 
parades.
By 1976, the combined strength of the army 
and police was only around 20,000. As 
teenagers, whenever we visited the Palaly 
where the army camp was situated, it never 
felt like a real military base to us. It lacked the 
atmosphere of a hardened, operational military 
installation. Instead, it seemed like a more 
relaxed place, far removed from the tense and 
formidable presence we would later come to 
associate with the military.
When did the shift from peaceful protests 
to armed struggle begin for you and 
others in the Tamil youth?
 I would say the shift truly began during 
Sathyaseelan's time with the Student 
Federation (Tamil Manavar Peravai). However, 
Sathyaseelan and his group lacked the 
experience to spearhead a fully organized 
armed movement. Their resources were 
minimal, with only a few rudimentary 
weapons at their disposal. Not long after the 
formation of the group, a significant wave 
of arrests followed, targeting key members, 
including some of those from the Tamil United 
Front's (TUF) youth wing. This crackdown, 
which saw figures like Mavai Senathiraja and 
Vannai Anandan from the TUF youth wing 
detained, dealt a severe blow to the movement, 
disrupting its progress.
What were the connections between the 
Student Federation and the Tamil United 
Front's youth wing?
There were links between the Tamil Student 
Young Ragavan in 1987

Federation and the youth wing of the 
Tamil United Front, which led the police to 
indiscriminately arrest members from both 
groups. Although the TUF's youth wing was 
not directly involved in armed violence, some 
of its members sympathized with the Tamil 
Student Council. This heightened suspicion 
and resulted in the widespread arrest of key 
individuals.
Who were the key figures who evaded 
arrest and continued armed resistance?
Following the arrests, a few small groups 
that evaded detention took up arms. Key 
figures among them included Sivakumaran, 
Kuttimani, Thangathurai, and Prabhakaran. 
At that time, the idea of Tamil Eelam was 
beginning to emerge, though it was still in its 
infancy. 
Was there widespread support for Tamil 
Eelam and armed resistance during this 
time?
No, there was very limited support from the 
Tamil population or the youth at that time. 
Only small groups of five to ten individuals 
were actively discussing the ideas of Tamil 
Eelam and armed struggle. The majority of the 
Tamil community opposed the idea of taking 
up arms or creating a separate nation for 
Tamils.
I would say it was a premature decision 
by inexperienced youths to resort to arms 
in the 1970s. While the Tamil nationalist 
leadership, first under the Federal Party 
and later the Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF), campaigned for the political rights 
of Tamil-speaking people, they lacked 
grassroots organizations and a sustained 
civil disobedience movement. Their primary 
goal was to secure parliamentary seats by 
leveraging Tamil nationalist sentiments. The 
radicalized youths, dissatisfied with the TULF's 
lack of commitment, partly contributed to 
the rise of militant movements. It is incorrect 
to claim that the youth took up arms because 
peaceful protests had been exhausted. After the 
Satyagraha in 1961, there were no sustained 
non-violent civil rights movements, aside 
from a few token hunger strikes and protests 
organized by the TULF in the 1970s.  
What ideological influences shaped the 
call for a Tamil homeland?
The concept of a Tamil homeland should be 
considered within the context of post-colonial 
nation-building, during which the Sri Lankan 
state emerged as a Sinhala Buddhist nation-
state, with the claim that Sri Lanka belonged 
exclusively to Sinhala Buddhists. To challenge 
this Sinhala Buddhist ideology, Tamil political 
leaders framed Tamil identity and asserted 
that the North and East of Sri Lanka are the 
traditional homelands of the Tamils. I would 
argue that Tamil nationalism is a mirror image 
of Sinhala nationalism, as both constructed 
their claims of cultural uniqueness and 
superiority based on similar premises. 
The Jaffna Kingdom indeed existed, but the 
distortion lies in two points: first, the Jaffna 
Kingdom did not exist as a Tamil kingdom in 
the modern sense, and second, it was confined 
to the Jaffna Peninsula, while other areas were 
under different rulers—both Sinhala and Tamil 
kings.
Notably, the East was incorporated into the 
Kandyan Kingdom, which was 'Sinhalese.' 
Therefore, it is evident that the notion of a 
traditional homeland is not primordial but 
rather a newly constructed idea based on 
selective myths and historical interpretations.  
Leaders like V. Navaratnam from the Tamils 
Suyaadchchi Kazhagam (Tamil Self-Rule

Party) voiced the need for a Tamil homeland. 
They drew parallels between the Tamil 
people and the Jewish community, arguing 
that while other communities had their own 
nations, the Tamils did not. Navaratnam even 
went so far as to translate and publish the 
Zionist book Exodus in Tamil, which justified 
Jewish colonization—a perspective viewed as 
problematic by many.
The underlying belief was that the Tamil 
people, with their proud history, had lost their 
significance due to the absence of a homeland. 
They argued that establishing a Tamil nation 
was essential to reclaim their historical glory. 
Meanwhile, the majority government in Sri 
Lanka consistently refused to grant political 
rights to the Tamil minority. In response, 
Tamil political parties proposed a federal 
solution to address these grievances. 
Additionally, the Tamil Arasu Katchi 
advocated for the rights of Tamil-speaking 
people, including Muslims and hill-country 
Tamils. However, numerous challenges 
hindered this vision. While the concept 
of 'Tamil-speaking people' was broad and 
inclusive, political leaders lacked the expansive 
mindset needed to effectively implement it. 
Moreover, when the LTTE became a dominant 
force, the concept of 'Tamil-speaking people' 
was abandoned, and Tamil identity became 
the rallying cry. This shift led to the rise of an 
exclusive, narrow form of Tamil nationalism, 
which eventually became the dominant 
discourse. 
Which liberation organization did you 
first come into contact with?
My first contact was with the LTTE, though at 
that time, the organization was known as the 
Tamil New Tigers (TNT). Interestingly, the 
acronym TNT also stands for Trinitrotoluene, 
an explosive compound, and the name was 
coined by A. Rajarathinam, a key figure in the 
early stages of the Tamil uprising.
Rajarathinam was deeply involved in the 
struggle, and when 42 youths were arrested, 
he resigned from his government clerical 
job and fled to India, where he lived under 
extremely harsh conditions. There was a rumor 
that his daughter, Dhanu, was responsible for 
Ragavan’s passport photo taken in 1985, 
after he left the LTTE.

the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in a suicide 
bombing. However, it has now been almost 
conclusively proven that she was not involved, 
and the woman believed to be the suicide 
bomber is reportedly living abroad. 
 When was TNT officially formed?
The exact date of the TNT's formation is 
unclear. However, it began to take shape 
after the arrest of members of the Student 
Federation around 1972. Prabhakaran, 
known for his keen sense of self-preservation, 
managed to evade capture and fled to 
India. During his time in Chennai, he met 
Rajarathinam, who played a pivotal role 
in shaping the idea of TNT. Rajarathinam 
emphasized the legacy of the Chola Empire, 
their tiger emblem, and their historical glory. 
He inspired Prabhakaran with the idea that 
the tiger, a powerful and fearsome predator, 
would be the perfect symbol for their guerrilla 
movement. This was when the concept of TNT 
began to take root, initially as just an idea.  
When did you join TNT?
I officially joined the TNT in the latter part 
of 1974, by which time I was already deeply 
entrenched in Tamil nationalist ideology. 
This came in the wake of the arrest of the 
42 youths. During that period, Chelliah 
Thanabalasingham alias Chetti, Chelliah 
Pathmanathan alias Kannadi Padmanathan, 
Ramesh, and another individual—whose 
name escapes me—managed to escape 
from Anuradhapura prison. While making 
their way through the jungles, Chetti killed 
Kannadi Padmanathan, though the reason 
for this remains a mystery to me. Chetti's 
actions, however, sparked a troubling incident, 
marking the first internal murder within the 
militant movements. Chetti and Ramesh 
eventually made contact with people in 
Punnalaikadduvan, my village, where they 
stayed with someone I knew.
My first real connection to the movement 
came through Chetti in 1974. In my village, 
there was a man named Ramachandran, who 
styled himself as MSR He had a friend named 
Jeevan, who had been part of the Student 
Federation and was hiding at MSR's house. 
Through MSR, I was introduced to Chetti.  
Why did Chetti kill Kannadi 
Padmanathan? Was Chetti a criminal?
The reason remains a mystery to me to this 
day. Some speculated that Chetti killed 
Kannadi Padmanathan because he opposed 
bank robberies. Chetti and the others were 
introduced to us as prison escapees, but the 
full details of the incident were never entirely 
clear.
Chetti had been in a juvenile correctional 
facility, so I can't say for certain whether 
he was a hardened criminal, but there were 
definitely criminal elements in his character—
that much I can say.
Sathyaseelan believed that individuals 
involved in criminal activities often possessed 
a certain kind of resourcefulness, and he 
thought we could leverage that for our cause. 
It was Sathyaseelan who brought Chetti into 
the Tamil Student Federation. Interestingly, 
Prabhakaran shared a similar outlook and 
worked closely with Chetti. At that time, 
Prabhakaran was already in India, but he had 
connections with Chetti during the early days 
of the Student Federation.
Were there others with a criminal 
background like Chetti in the liberation 
movements? Such as Kuttimani and 
Thangathurai?
Kuttimani and Thangathurai cannot be

labeled as criminals. Although they had 
smuggling links, I wouldn't consider that a 
serious flaw. In fact, during colonial times 
and earlier, places like Valvettithurai were 
deeply involved in overseas trade. During 
colonial rule, Sri Lankans were all subjects of 
the British Crown, which meant they could 
travel and trade freely without restrictions.
However, after independence and the 
establishment of the nation-state, customs 
regulations were introduced, which created 
problems for coastal communities like those 
in Valvettithurai. What had been their way 
of life for generations was suddenly classified 
as smuggling. The people of Valvettithurai 
didn't see it that way—they continued the 
trade they had always known. To them, it 
was simply 'business,' not a criminal act. 
How did you first meet Prabhakaran, 
and where did this introduction take 
place?  
By the end of 1974, Chetti introduced 
me to Prabhakaran, and I first met him 
in Punnalaikkadduvan. At that time, 
Prabhakaran was the youngest among 
them, yet there was something distinctively 
different about him. He and I formed an 
immediate connection. Before meeting him, 
I had never even heard of Prabhakaran—
he was virtually unknown. The prominent 
figures at the time were Kuttimani, 
Thangathurai, and others, not Prabhakaran.
Prabhakaran was extremely cautious and 
almost elusive, ensuring that very few 
people knew him or his whereabouts. This 
calculated caution allowed him to remain 
in the shadows during those early days. 
However, once I met him, I sensed there 
was something unique about him—his 
vision was quietly intense, and his resolve 
was unmistakable. At that time, TNT was

more of a concept than a fully developed 
organization, but it was slowly taking shape, 
and I found myself becoming part of its early 
foundation. 
How did the lack of structure within the 
Tamil Student Federation lead to its 
downfall?
While Sathyaseelan and a few others were the 
first to be arrested, many of them revealed 
the names of their comrades to the police. 
As a result, nearly everyone connected 
to the Student Federation was eventually 
apprehended. Prabhakaran, however, with 
his natural sense of caution and foresight, 
managed to avoid arrest and fled to India.
 The fundamental issue was that the Tamil 
Student Federation lacked a proper, secure 
system. In any secret organization, the rule 
is that each member should only know a 
few others, ensuring that the majority of the 
network remains unknown to them. This 
way, even if someone is captured, they can't 
compromise the entire group. However, within 
the student council, nearly everyone knew 
each other, and this familiarity ultimately led 
to its downfall.
What was your first impression when you 
met Prabhakaran?
I liked him immediately. There was only a 
two-year difference between us—he was born 
on November 26, 1954, and I on November 
5, 1956. Despite his youth, Prabhakaran 
possessed a calm intensity and an unshakable 
determination that was impossible to ignore. 
He was friendly and focused, and what struck 
me most was his unwavering commitment to 
his beliefs. Beyond notions of right or wrong, 
his loyalty to his ideology was absolute, and 
that deeply inspired me.
What impressed me even more was his 
knowledge of global freedom struggles, 
including the Irish fight for independence—a 
rare subject for someone our age. He spoke 
in detail about Irish revolutionaries like 
Dan Breen and Michael Collins. At such 
a young age, Prabhakaran had already 
immersed himself in the strategies of these 
figures, drawing parallels between their 
methods and the struggle he envisioned for 
the Tamil people. He had read Dan Breen's 
autobiography, My Fight for Irish Freedom, 
which had been translated into Tamil, and 
thoroughly absorbed its lessons, modeling his 
own ideas on their tactics of urban guerrilla 
warfare.
Prabhakaran also held deep admiration for 
Indian freedom fighters like Subhas Chandra 
Bose and Bhagat Singh. He rejected Mahatma 
Gandhi's non-violent approach, instead 
favoring the militant paths of Bose and Bhagat 
Singh. While Bhagat Singh was an atheist and 
socialist who renounced religious and ethnic 
identities, Prabhakaran did not adopt these 
aspects of his ideology. He embraced Bhagat 
Singh's use of violence in the struggle for 
Freedom but did not subscribe to his broader 
socialist or atheistic beliefs.
Prabhakaran's focus was always clear: 
the Tamil people needed a homeland. He 
frequently drew comparisons between various 
independence struggles, but his conclusion 
was always the same—Tamil Eelam was the 
only solution for the Tamil people.
 Why was Prabhakaran selective in his 
beliefs?
Prabhakaran was deeply opposed to leftist 
ideology, particularly because he believed 
it conflicted with the fundamental goal of 
establishing a Tamil nation. In his view, leftist 
thinking was rooted in class unity, which he

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
18
saw as incompatible with the creation of a 
unified Tamil identity. He believed that Tamil 
nationalism required all Tamils to unite under 
a singular identity without focusing on internal 
divisions such as class and caste.
Prabhakaran was convinced that emphasizing 
class would undermine the cause of Tamil 
Eelam by dividing the Tamil people. This belief 
led to his harsh stance against leftist leaders 
like Annamalai and Vijayendran. Although 
they were leftists who supported the Tamils' 
right to self-determination, Prabhakaran 
viewed them as threats to the Tamil nationalist 
ideology.  
His disdain for leftist ideology extended 
beyond these individuals. He once told me 
that if the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) 
ever rose again, he would side with the Sri 
Lankan government to suppress them. That's 
how much he despised leftist movements. He 
believed that the JVP, being a revolutionary 
Marxist movement, posed a threat to the 
possibility of Tamil Eelam. 
In his view, if the JVP succeeded in their 
struggle, the chances of achieving a Tamil 
homeland would be unlikely.
He believed that if the Sinhalese and 
Tamil working classes united, it would be 
catastrophic for the Tamil nationalist cause. 
This fear of class-based unity between ethnic 
groups is what led him to target and eliminate 
leftist leaders.
Prabhakaran extended this ideology to anti-
caste activists as well. Leaders from anti-caste 
organizations like the Mass Movement for 
the Removal of Untouchability (Theendamai 
Ozhippu Vekusana Iyakkam) were also 
intimidated. In Jaffna, it was primarily 
communist leaders who spearheaded anti-
caste protests. Prabhakaran opposed these 
movements because he feared that if oppressed 
caste Tamils united along caste lines rather 
than as a unified ethnic group, it would 
weaken the Tamil nationalist movement. For 
him, the focus had to remain on ethnic unity, 
with all other social divisions set aside, as he 
believed this was the only way to achieve Tamil 
Eelam. 
 What was Prabhakaran's view on caste?
Prabhakaran didn't have a deep or nuanced 
understanding of caste, but he was firmly 
opposed to caste divisions. He believed 
that caste distinctions undermined Tamil 
unity and, in turn, weakened the broader 
Tamil identity. While he was determined 
to eliminate caste-based discrimination, 
he didn't fully grasp the socio-economic, 
religious, and cultural complexities behind 
the caste system. However, his resolve was 
clear—caste differences should not interfere 
with the collective struggle for Tamil Eelam. 
Within the LTTE, he did not tolerate caste-
based discrimination, insisting that all fighters 
be treated equally, regardless of their caste 
background.  
That said, it would be unrealistic to claim that 
the LTTE was entirely free of caste influences, 
as its members came from the same society 
where caste was deeply ingrained. Even though 
caste prejudice wasn't openly displayed, 
traces of that mentality may have lingered. 
Nonetheless, Prabhakaran was clear that no 
caste discrimination should be allowed within 
the organization.
This principle was not exclusive to the LTTE. 
Other Tamil liberation movements, like 
the EPRLF (Eelam People's Revolutionary 
Liberation Front), also believed that caste 
divisions should be eradicated. The EPRLF, 
in particular, was committed to fighting caste 
oppression. However, Prabhakaran believed 
that addressing caste issues at that time would

distract from the ultimate goal of Tamil 
Eelam. In his view, caste differences should be 
eradicated, but only after the Tamil homeland 
had been established.
During the LTTE's reign, they took measures 
to combat caste-based oppression. People from 
oppressed castes held significant positions 
within the LTTE, as they did in other Tamil 
militant organizations, further reinforcing the 
idea that caste should not play a role in the 
movement.
Historically, two castes held considerable 
influence in Jaffna during the colonial era: 
the Vellalar and the Karaiyar, to which 
Prabhakaran belonged. The Karaiyar caste 
had a unique socio-economic and cultural 
standing; unlike many other oppressed castes, 
they were not dependent on the Vellalar for 
their livelihood. They had their own distinct 
economic and cultural systems, which set them 
apart.
During colonial times, members of the 
Karaiyar caste also held important positions 
in the government. While they were not as 
dominant as the Vellalars, they were better off 
than many other castes. They indeed harbored 
some resentment toward Vellalar's dominance, 
and this resentment had legitimacy. 
Prabhakaran, too, harbored what I believe was 
a justified anger toward Vellalar hegemony. 
I recall during a split within the LTTE, 
Prabhakaran, in a fit of anger, sarcastically 
remarked to me that what was being called 
'socialism' by those who opposed him was 
nothing more than 'Vellalar socialism.'
What were Prabhakaran's weaknesses?
His fundamental flaw was his authoritarian 
mindset. He believed that no other 
organization, apart from his own, should have 
a role in the liberation struggle. He lacked 
democratic values and had no tolerance 
for pluralistic thinking. In my view, this 
is not unique to Prabhakaran; those who 
advocate for ethnic nationalism—whether 
Tamil or Sinhala—generally lack democratic 
and pluralistic traits. When you pursue a 
nationalistic agenda based on ethnicity, it 
inherently lacks the qualities of democracy, as 
it fails to accept other ethnicities or cultures. 
How did he develop this mindset? Was 
it due to his upbringing, Jaffna's way 
of thinking, Tamil heritage, or was it 
influenced by the books he read?
I would say it was a blend of all those factors. 
He held a few unwavering beliefs: the Tamils 
needed a separate homeland, and any means 
to achieve that end were justified. He believed 
that ancient Tamil empires like the Cholas, 
Pandyas, and Cheras were weakened by their 
divisions, preventing them from establishing a 
larger, unified empire. From this, he concluded 
that only one organization should lead the 
fight for Tamil liberation. His mindset was 
deeply rooted in a rigid, right-wing ideology.
How did he arrive at these conclusions?
 I think he arrived at these conclusions by 
reading popular novels that glorified the Chola 
empire, such as Kalki's Ponniyin Selvan or 
Sandilyan's historical fiction. I don't believe 
he reached these conclusions through deep 
historical study but rather through popular 
literature that romanticized Tamil history.
This kind of shallow historical perspective 
often influences those who advocate for 
pure Tamil nationalism. For instance, V. 
Navaratnam of Suyadchi Kazhagam made 
absurd comparisons, such as likening Tamils

to Jews in terms of cultural characteristics-
claiming a supposed predisposition for 
intelligence and entrepreneurship-and argued 
that they were similar. In fact, Prabhakaran 
was a follower of V. Navaratnam and was 
inspired by the establishment of Israel by the 
Jewish people, without understanding the 
settler colonial project behind it. 
What other flaws did he have?
His refusal to allow alternative movements also 
meant he did not tolerate differing ideas within 
the LTTE itself. For instance, if someone said, 
'I want Tamil Eelam, but I disagree with the 
methods of the LTTE,' Prabhakaran believed 
that person was not a suitable candidate.
If an LTTE fighter or sympathizer agreed 
with the principle of self-determination but 
had some criticisms of the LTTE's methods, 
Prabhakaran believed that person had no place 
and should be eliminated. This mindset led the 
LTTE to commit thousands of murders in the 
name of the Tamil cause. It was Prabhakaran's 
intolerance of dissent or differing opinions that 
resulted in these massacres. 
 Where did Prabhakaran's mindset of 
eliminating those with differing opinions 
come from?
Prabhakaran's way of thinking was deeply 
complex. On one occasion, he shot and 
killed a policeman named Karunanithi at 
Kankesanthurai (KKS). After the killing, he 
retreated to one of his hideouts in Urelu. At 
that very moment, the song 
"Maranathai Enni Kalangidum Vijaya, 
Maranathin Thanmai Solven...
Māṇiḍar āṉmā maraṇameytātu...
Maṟupadi piṟantirukkum mēṉiyai koḷv̱ āy,
Mēṉiyai koḷv̱ āy"
Which can be loosely translated as:
"Vijaya, troubled by the thought of death, I will 
tell you the nature of death...
The soul of man does not die...
Kill the body that has been reborn,
Kill the body."- from the movie Karnan, sung 
by Seerkazhi Govindarajan, was playing. 
Prabhakaran felt as though the song was 
speaking directly to him.
He had a profound belief in the teachings of 
the Bhagavad Gita, which deeply influenced 
his mindset. The Gita's core philosophy—'Do 
your duty without expecting the fruits. The 
soul is eternal; only the body dies.'—resonated 
strongly with him.
For Prabhakaran, his actions were not 
murders; in his mind, he was simply 
performing his Dharma. Even if he had to 
kill someone close to him, he didn't view it as 
murder but as fulfilling his duty. If the person 
was close, he would convince himself that it 
was only their body that perished while their 
soul remained eternal.
In addition to this, he also believed in 
Adolf Hitler's authoritarianism and Zionist 
exclusivism. His worldview was a complex 
mixture of right-wing ideologies.
Over time, this belief grew stronger, and 
he began to see himself as almost a divine 
incarnation, acting under a higher purpose. 
His actions, including eliminating dissenters, 
were justified in his mind as part of his 
Dharma.

Did he begin to see himself as a divine 
incarnation while you were still part of the 
organization?
By 1980 or 1981, Prabhakaran had already begun to 
see himself in that light. In his mind, anything that 
aligned with his will was justified. For him, it wasn't 
just about personal preferences—it was about serving 
a higher purpose. He started to believe that those who 
opposed him were not merely disagreeing with him but 
obstructing this higher purpose, and therefore, they had 
to be eliminated.
 For Prabhakaran, Tamil Eelam—or even the LTTE 
itself—was secondary. In his view, he was Tamil Eelam; 
he was the LTTE. He believed that only those loyal to

few inside photos were 
taken by Santhagunam
him could truly be loyal to the 
cause of Tamil Eelam or the LTTE.
No one could say, 'I am loyal to the 
Tamil Eelam cause or the LTTE, 
but I disagree with Prabhakaran's 
methods.' If someone did, 
Prabhakaran believed they had 
to be sidelined, silenced, or 
eliminated. To him, there was 
no distinction—Prabhakaran 
and the LTTE were one and the 
same. Loyalty to him became 
synonymous with loyalty to the 
cause.
Even today, if you speak to former 
LTTE members, many will say, 
"Annan (Prabhakaran) never 
made mistakes." For them, the 
idea that Prabhakaran could 
have erred or been vulnerable 
to mistakes is unimaginable. 
This strong belief system grew 
both within him and within 
the organization. Ultimately, 
this unwavering conviction—
where no dissent or alternative 
views were tolerated or even 
considered—led to his downfall 
and the destruction of the LTTE at 
Nandikadal Lagoon.
