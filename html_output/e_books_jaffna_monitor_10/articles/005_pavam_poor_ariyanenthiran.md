T
he Election Commission has revealed that 
Tamil common candidate Pakkiyaselvam 
Ariyanenthiran, along with two others, has 
failed to submit their election expenditure 
reports by the prescribed deadline. The 
deadline for Presidential election candidates to 
file their reports ended on October 13th.
Saman Sri Ratnayake, the Commissioner of the 
Election Commission, named the defaulting 
candidates as Pakkiyaselvam Ariyanenthiran, 
Ven. Battaramulle Seelarathana Thera, and 
former MP Sarath Keerthirathna. He further 
stated, "The list of candidates who failed 
to submit the expenditure reports will be 
handed over to the police for further action, 
in accordance with the Election Expenses 
Regulation Act."
Under the Presidential Election Act of 1981, 
candidates who fail to meet the deadline may 
face penalties, including fines up to Rs.100,000. 
The Election Expenses Regulation Act 
stipulates that all reports must be submitted 
within 21 days of the election's conclusion.

Conch Grabbed, Caught in 
Legal Nightmares

factions with hidden agendas, now finds 
himself in an increasingly precarious position. 
Initially used as a pawn by groups exploiting 
Tamil nationalism for electoral gain, he has 
since been abandoned by those same parties. 
These political factions, having unethically 
and cunningly seized the Conch symbol—
originally the symbol of the Tamil common 
candidate and heavily promoted by diaspora 
investment—have sidelined Ariyanenthiran 
after the presidential election.
To make matters worse, as a central committee 
member of ITAK, Ariyanenthiran now faces 
disciplinary action from his own party. With 
internal conflicts mounting and the failure 
to submit the required expenditure accounts 
hanging over him, he finds himself politically 
isolated and stranded.
According to legal experts, who 
spoke with jaffna monitor, 
a case regarding the non-
submission of election 
expenses is likely 
to be filed against 
Ariyanenthiran, as he 
missed the deadline to 
submit his accounts to 
the Election Commission. 
The groups that once 
backed him for the election 
have distanced themselves, 
leaving him solely responsible for 
the repercussions.
Just days before the Election Commission's 
revelation, Nilanthan, a prominent columnist 
who played a key role in promoting 
Ariyanenthiran's Tamil common candidacy 
for his own political and financial gain, was 
questioned by journalists about the submission 
of expenditure reports. In response, Nilanthan 
confidently claimed, "The accounts have been 
submitted to the relevant authorities, and in 
due time, they will be made available to the 
public." However, the Election Commission's 
recent announcement swiftly contradicted 
this, clarifying that the reports were not 
submitted on time. Observers now remark 
that Nilanthan's words are as slippery as his 
political maneuvers.
It looks like Pavam 
(Poor) Ariyanenthiran, 
who was launched into 
the election with grand 
promises and big dreams, 
is now left to fend off the 
legal firestorm all by himself! 
The whole situation brings to 
mind the iconic Vadivelu comedy scene: 
"cRg;Ngj;jp cRg;Ngj;jpNa clk;ig 
uzfsk; Mf;fpl;lhq;fa;ah" which roughly 
translates to, "They hyped me up and hyped 
me up until they turned my body into a 
battlefield, my friend!"
Now, poor Ariyanenthiran is stuck in a real-
life comedy where all the hype has left him 
dodging legal bullets solo, with no backup in 
sight!
