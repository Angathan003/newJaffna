A 
total of 23 political parties and 21 
independent groups, comprising 396 
candidates, have been cleared to contest in 
the upcoming parliamentary elections for 
the Jaffna District, which is allocated just six 
seats. Election Officer and Acting Government 
Agent Maruthalingam Piratheepan made 
this announcement during a press briefing in 
Jaffna.
Piratheepan also confirmed that 593,187 
registered voters in the Jaffna District are 
eligible to cast their votes in what promises to 
be a fiercely contested election. The candidate 
pool reflects a broad spectrum of political 
ideologies. Prominent political parties 
fielding candidates include the Eelam People's 
Democratic Party (EPDP), Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK), All Ceylon Tamil Congress, 
Tamil People's Alliance, National People's 
Power (NPP), Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna 
(SLPP), and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).
In addition to the political parties, 21 
independent groups have been approved 
to participate, one of which is led by the 
controversial figure Dr. Archchuna. However, 
two independent groups were disqualified 
during the nomination process, with 
Piratheepan citing valid reasons for their 
rejection following a thorough review.
