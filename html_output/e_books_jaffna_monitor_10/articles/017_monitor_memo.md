The Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP), 
under the leadership of former Fisheries 
Minister Douglas Devananda, has made a 
landmark move by becoming the first Tamil 
political party to field Buddhist monks 
as candidates for the 2024 Parliamentary 
Elections. This unprecedented step marks the 
first instance of a Tamil party nominating 
Buddhist monks to contest a national election 
in Sri Lanka.
Venerable Kiriebbanare Vijitha Thera and 
Venerable Udawalawe Jinasiri Thera will 
contest from the EPDP in the Colombo 
District. Speaking to the media after 
submitting his nomination, Venerable Vijitha 
Thera stated that his decision to run was 
driven by the desire to promote national 
reconciliation. "I decided to contest from the 
EPDP to foster unity. Our goal is not to seek 
positions, but to work towards building a 
united Sri Lanka," he said.
The EPDP's candidate list for the Colombo 
District includes a diverse group of 
representatives from Tamil, Muslim, and 
Sinhala communities. Former Western 
Provincial Council member S. Rajendran, 
who is leading the list, stated that the party 
aims to approach the election by focusing on 
inclusivity and bridging ethnic and religious 
divisions.
The Colombo District candidate list comprises 
21 individuals, including 10 Tamil, three 
Muslim, and seven Sinhala candidates, along 
with the two Buddhist monks.
