There's a Tamil proverb, unrefined in its 
original form, but when translated politely, 
it conveys: "The strong sheep laments over 
grass for survival, while another sheep laments 
over more trivial matters." This classic, albeit 
unpolished, proverb aptly reflects the actions 
of Jaffna University's Vice-Chancellor, Dr. 
Srisatkunarajah.
While the university struggles with inadequate 
infrastructure and its students face a lack of 
basic necessities, critics accuse him of lavish 
spending on unnecessary vanity projects 
that focus on personal self-promotion rather 
than addressing student welfare or critical 
infrastructural needs.
One of the key projects under scrutiny is the 
construction of a gateway near Parameswaran 
Temple within the university, which cost Rs. 
9.5 million. The controversy escalated when 
an additional Rs. 4.5 million was spent on 
renovating the university's main entrance, 
which was originally inaugurated in 1974 by 
then-Prime Minister Srimavo Bandaranaike 
and has served the university for over 50 years.
Following the renovation, a public ceremony 
was held, during which the Vice-Chancellor's 
name replaced that of the former Prime 
Minister on the commemorative plaque. 
This act has sparked accusations of 
historical revisionism and highlighted the 
Vice-Chancellor's inclination toward self-
promotion.

Meanwhile, the disparity between 
these expenditures and the realities 
faced by Jaffna University students 
is glaring. Many students reportedly 
struggle to meet basic needs, with 
some unable to afford even three meals 
a day. Restroom facilities for both 
male and female students are woefully 
inadequate, and the existing ones 
are in disrepair. Additionally, hostel 
accommodations for out-of-district 
students remain insufficient, and those 
available fall far short of acceptable 
standards.
The university's research labs are also under-
equipped, which has significantly impacted 
academic activities, as noted by lecturers who 
spoke to Jaffna Monitor.
"This is a clear example of misusing public 
funds for unnecessary projects while 
neglecting the real needs of students," said a 
concerned observer.
"At a time when the country is grappling 
with severe economic challenges, it is deeply 
troubling to see funds being wasted on vanity 
projects. The Vice-Chancellor seems intent 
on leaving his name on these projects rather 
than addressing the pressing needs of the 
university," a university professor, who wished 
to remain anonymous, told Jaffna Monitor.
An insider from the NPP revealed to Jaffna 
Monitor that the recent removal of the 
University Grants Commission (UGC) 
Chairman and Vice-Chairman was tied to 
their backing of such controversial actions by 
Vice-Chancellors. Further investigations are 
expected, with more administrative shake-ups 
likely to follow.
