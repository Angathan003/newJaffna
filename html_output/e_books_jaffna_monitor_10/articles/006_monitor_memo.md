Former Chief Minister of the Northern 
Province and ex-MP, C.V. Wigneswaran, is 
reportedly packing his bags and heading back 
to Colombo for good—finally returning to 
his Tamil elite Sinhala-mixed roots in the 
capital. After a decade of political highs and 
plenty of headaches for the Tamil community, 
Wigneswaran seems ready to close the chapter 
on northern politics.
Backed by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), 
he successfully contested and won the Chief 
Minister post during the Northern Provincial 
Council elections, with the party providing 
him with the necessary support and resources. 
Upon taking office, his very first official move 
was to write a letter to Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi, not for development or 
pressing political matters, but to request the 
release of his guru Premananda's disciples. 
Premananda, a convicted sexual offender, was 
jailed for sexually assaulting underage girls 
and eventually died in prison—a guru with 
quite the legacy.
His term as Chief Minister was followed by 
a parliamentary career—successful for him, 
though not so much for the people—where 
he thoroughly enjoyed the privileges and 
benefits of office. In one memorable episode, 
Wigneswaran helped a woman secure a bar 
permit, explaining that she was an orphan 
in dire need. What he conveniently forgot 
to mention was that her father had been a 
disciple of Premananda, and she already 
owned two bars!
With his parliamentary term behind him, 
Wigneswaran chose not to contest the recent 
elections. While he publicly claimed that he 
was "making space for younger politicians," 
Jaffna residents have their own version of 
the story. Many believe he saw an impending 
defeat and decided to bow out gracefully, 
delivering a classic judge-like verdict on his 
own political career.
As Wigneswaran prepares to bid farewell to 
the Northern Province, word on the street is 
that he's packed his bags and booked a one-
way ticket to Colombo. And if anyone dares 
to ask why he's leaving, don't be shocked if he 
pulls out the classic "health reasons" card or 
claims he's off for some mysterious "medical 
consultations"—because, of course, political 
exits need their own diagnoses!
