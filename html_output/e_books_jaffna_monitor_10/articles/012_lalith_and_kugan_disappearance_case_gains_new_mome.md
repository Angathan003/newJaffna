Lalith and Kugan 
Disappearance Case 
Gains New Momentum 
as Government Orders 
Fresh Probe
T
he Ministry of Public Security has ordered 
the police to expedite investigations 
into seven key cases, including the high-
profile disappearance of human rights 
defenders Lalith Kumar Weeraraj and Kugan 
Muruganandan. The two activists from the 
Frontline Socialist Party (FLSP) were abducted 
in Jaffna on December 9, 2011. This directive, 
issued to the Acting Inspector General of 
Police, is part of the government's renewed 
efforts to resolve long-standing, unresolved 
crimes, according to a source close to the NPP 
government who spoke to Jaffna Monitor.
Lalith and Kugan, both human rights activists 
and allies of what is now the National People's 
Power (NPP) government, were abducted 
while organizing a press conference for the 
People's Struggle Movement in Jaffna, which 
was scheduled for World Human Rights Day 
on December 10, 2011. Their abduction has 
raised questions for more than a decade, with 
many believing that the then-government, 
under President Mahinda Rajapaksa and 
Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was 
involved in their disappearance.
The two activists were last seen leaving Kugan's 
residence in Avarangal, Jaffna, before being 
reportedly abducted by a group of men on 
motorcycles and a white van along the Point 
Pedro main road. At the time, white vans were 
notoriously linked to abductions, particularly 
in Tamil-speaking areas. Eyewitnesses claim 
Lalith and Kugan were forcibly taken, making 
their disappearance one of many such cases 
that occurred during Sri Lanka's postwar 
period.
The Frontline Socialist Party (FLSP), following 
their abduction, issued a statement praising 
Lalith and Kugan's activism, saying: "Lalith 
and Kugan are remembered as two individuals 
who bravely fought against the wave of 
abductions and disappearances taking place 
in Sri Lanka during the postwar period. At 
a time when the North and the South were 
divided by an 'iron wall,' Lalith and Kugan

worked tirelessly to raise awareness among the 
people of the South about the struggles faced 
by the people in the North. They also strived 
to convince the people in the North that the 
people in the South were not their enemies but 
fellow citizens suffering in similar ways. Their 
efforts to bridge these divides were seen as a 
direct challenge to the authorities."
FLSP also added, "During a time when the 
authorities wanted to separate people as 
Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim, Lalith and Kugan 
fought to unite these races as Sri Lankans. That 
is why they were abducted." Their commitment 
to uniting all ethnic groups in Sri Lanka under 
a single identity was seen as a threat to the 
then-ruling regime.
Lalith's father, a rubber tapper from Siri 
Niwasa Watte, has long believed that 
government forces were responsible for 
his son's abduction. His suspicions were 
reinforced by an early statement from then-
Cabinet Spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella, 
who initially claimed that Lalith and Kugan 
were in police custody. However, this claim 
was later denied by both the police and 
Rambukwella.
With the recent change in government and 
the rise of the NPP to power, there are reports 
that this case may be reopened, signaling 
a potential shift in political will to address 
unresolved cases from the past. Speculation 
is mounting that reopening the investigation 
could lead to senior figures from the previous 
government being brought to court or even 
facing jail time.
For over a decade, the families of Lalith and 
Kugan have sought justice and answers. 
This new directive by the Ministry of Public 
Security, if acted upon, could finally bring 
closure to a case that has come to symbolize 
the broader issue of enforced disappearances 
in postwar Sri Lanka. The outcome of this 
investigation may also set a precedent for the 
pursuit of justice in many other unresolved 
cases of abductions that occurred during the 
same period.
