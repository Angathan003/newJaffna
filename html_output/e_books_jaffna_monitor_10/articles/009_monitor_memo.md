Monitor Memo
"T
he newly elected government, headed by 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, promised 
to reveal the names of those who received 
liquor licenses within three days. It has now 
been three weeks, and still, no sign of those 
names. I openly challenge the government 
to release the details of who got these liquor 
licenses," said M.A. Sumanthiran, former 
Member of Parliament for the Ilankai Tamil 
Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), during the ITAK 
candidate introduction event in Jaffna.
Speaking at the event held at the Thanthai 
Chelva Auditorium in Jaffna, Sumanthiran did 
not hesitate to criticize the very government 
and president he had, only weeks earlier, 
Sumanthiran to AKD: 
Promises Aged Like Whiskey-But 
Where’s the Liquor permit List?

described as a thorough gentleman and not a 
Sinhala chauvinist. Sumanthiran remarked that 
the administration and the president appeared 
to be faltering in their own anti-corruption 
narrative, particularly in addressing election 
expenses and the transparency of liquor license 
allocations.
"This government, which claims to be anti-
corruption, has stumbled in two key areas," 
Sumanthiran said. "First, they still haven't 
settled the election expenses with the Election 
Commission. Second, they vowed to reveal the 
names of those who received liquor licenses 
in three days. It's been three weeks now, and 
we're still in the dark," he added. Sources hint 
that one of the alleged license recipients might 
be his political rival within ITAK, Sritharan. 
If the names are revealed, it could potentially 
give Sumanthiran a moral and political upper 
hand both within the party and outside it—a 
win-win situation for him.
Sumanthiran then shifted focus to his party's 
candidate selection process. "We've prioritized 
the youth," he said proudly, though he 
conveniently skipped over the fact that all the 
chosen candidates just happen to be his loyal 
yes-men and women, handpicked for their 
unwavering allegiance to him.
Sumanthiran then moved on to his party's 
candidate selection process. "We've prioritized 
the youth," he said proudly, although he 
conveniently omitted the fact that all the 
chosen candidates seem to be his loyal yes-
men and women, handpicked for their 
unflinching allegiance to him.
He wasn't done yet. Sumanthiran then turned 
his attention to the defectors, accusing them 
of dishonesty. "At one point, we thought 
thieves, extortionists, and even murderers 
had turned over a new leaf, so we brought 
them into the fold," he said, recalling how 
former militant groups such as EPRLF, TELO, 
and PLOTE were welcomed into the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA). "But it turns out, 
they haven't changed at all. First, they stole our 
party name"—a jab at the Democratic TNA 
(dTNA)—"and now they've stolen our election 
symbol too." He was referring to the conch 
symbol, originally used by the common Tamil 
candidate in the last presidential election, 
which was cunningly swiped by the dTNA.
But he conveniently forgot to mention that 
it was with the help of votes from these same 
'thieves, extortionists, and murderers' that he 
entered Parliament on the national list for the 
first time in 2010.
