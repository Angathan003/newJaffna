A young family man tragically lost his life 
in a fatal accident near the Vallai Bridge in 
Vadamarachchi, Jaffna, shortly after returning 
from his son's Édu Thodakkuthal ceremony. 
The incident occurred on 
Vijayadasami Day, the final 
day of Navarathiri when the 
Édu Thodakkuthal ritual 
is traditionally performed. 
The deceased, Thurailingam 
Malaimagan, 38, had taken 
his son to a temple to formally 
begin his education, a sacred 
milestone in Tamil culture.
Malaimagan, the manager of 
the Jaffna branch of Damro 
Furniture Company and a father of two young 
sons was on his way home when the tragic 
accident occurred. While crossing the Vallai 
Bridge, Malaimagan's motorcycle slipped on 
the rain-slicked surface and collided with a 
lorry transporting scrap metal. This marks 
nearly the 10th accident in the area since 
the start of the rainy season, raising serious 
concerns about road safety.
The Vallai Bridge, made of aluminum and 
iron, has become notoriously slippery during 
wet weather, leading to several fatal accidents. 
Despite repeated requests from the local 
community for a safer, more durable bridge, 
residents claim their pleas 
have gone unanswered by 
authorities.
The driver of the lorry 
involved in the collision has 
been arrested, and police are 
continuing their investigations 
into the incident.
Malaimagan, originally from 
Myliddy, resided in Point 
Pedro before recently moving 
to Urumpirai. His sudden and untimely 
death has devastated his family and the local 
community.
Local residents have voiced their frustration, 
noting that they have long petitioned the 
authorities to replace the Vallai Bridge with 
a safer structure made from more suitable 
materials. However, they claim their repeated 
appeals have been ignored, contributing to the 
growing number of accidents in the area.
