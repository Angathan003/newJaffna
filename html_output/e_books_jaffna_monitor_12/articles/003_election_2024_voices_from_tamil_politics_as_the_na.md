Election 2024: Voices from 
Tamil Politics as the Nation 
Prepares to Vote
Dear Readers,
As Sri Lanka stands at the cusp of a decisive presidential 
election on September 21st, the nation's political future 
hangs in precarious uncertainty. This election has the 
potential to radically alter the country's trajectory, but 
it remains unclear whether it will dismantle entrenched 
power structures that have dominated for decades or 
if the electorate will prioritize stability and economic 
recovery.
For the first time, three formidable contenders-Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake-are vying for the presidency. With less than 
a week remaining, no clear frontrunner has emerged, 
leaving the outcome a matter of intense speculation. The 
nation's future now rests in the hands of its voters.
In this issue, we bring you exclusive interviews with 
two prominent figures in Tamil politics, each backing 
a different presidential candidate. Minister Douglas 
Devananda, who reached an unparalleled milestone-30 
years of uninterrupted parliamentary service on August 
17th, a record no Tamil politician has matched-gave us 
an incisive, no-holds-barred interview. A staunch ally of 
incumbent and independent presidential candidate Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, Devananda passionately advocates for 
continued leadership under Wickremesinghe. Drawing 
from the depth of his decades-long political journey, he 
underscores his unwavering commitment to stability and 
progress amidst the turbulence facing Sri Lanka today.

On the opposing side, we spoke with M.A. Sumanthiran, a formidable 
and astute lawyer who now serves as an MP for the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK). Sumanthiran and his party have thrown their support 
behind Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB).
In our interview, conducted just days before ITAK's official endorsement 
of Premadasa, Sumanthiran delved into the critical issues facing the 
Tamil people. His insights were as precise as his legal arguments. Yet, 
following ITAK's formal backing of Premadasa, our repeated attempts 
to follow up with Sumanthiran for updated perspectives were met with 
silence—calls went unanswered, and messages were ignored. We do 
not believe in creating controversy through our interviews, and if the 
interview with Sumanthiran stirs debate, we stand firm in knowing we 
have upheld our responsibility to provide honest, balanced reporting.
Both interviews presented here are the first of a two-part series, with the 
second instalment set to follow in our next edition. These discussions 
offer deep insights into the differing visions of these two key leaders and 
their chosen paths, reflecting the broader political dynamics at play.
As the presidential election on September 21st draws near, we urge every 
reader to exercise their right to vote. Your vote is your voice, your power 
to decide the direction of this nation. Cast your ballot for whomever you 
believe is best suited to lead, but make sure you make that choice. Sitting 
on the sidelines is not an option—if you don't vote, you forfeit the right 
to complain about the outcome. Take control, make it count, and let your 
voice be heard on the 21st!
