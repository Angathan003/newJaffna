A 
viral video featuring Illankai Tamil 
Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) MP Charles 
Nirmalanathan has sparked a political 
firestorm across social media. In the clip, 
Nirmalanathan casually brags about his close 
ties with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and 
even hints at the possibility of becoming Sri 
Lanka's next Finance Minister—a statement 
that has turned heads, raised eyebrows, and 
fueled some good-natured chuckles in political 
circles.
The video has quickly become a hot topic of 
discussion, spreading faster than a politician's 
campaign promise. With a tone of remarkable 
confidence, Nirmalanathan can be heard 
suggesting that his connections might soon 
lead him to control the nation's finances.
Political observers were quick to jump on 
the revelations, with one noting, "This video 
isn't just about Charles' ambitions. It shines 
a spotlight on the well-known but often 
unspoken deals between Tamil nationalist 
leaders and their Sinhala counterparts."
However, seasoned political watchers and 
the general public alike aren't particularly 
surprised by the content of the video. As one 
observer noted, "Even 
a child knows these 
secret relationships 
exist between Tamil 
nationalist politicians 
and successive 
governments. It's no 
mystery—this has been going on for years."
Many Tamil politicians, despite publicly 
positioning themselves as defenders of Tamil 
nationalism, have long maintained clandestine 
relationships with government officials. From 
liquor licenses to other lucrative deals, these 
personal benefits are an open secret. "If anyone 
steps out of line or fails to deliver on their end 
of the bargain, the government often retaliates 
by leaking evidence of these relationships," 
the observer added. "This video of Charles 
Nirmalanathan could be just that—a subtle 
warning shot."
The release of this video has set tongues 
wagging, with comparisons being made to 
previous cases where MPs, publicly hailed 
as guardians of Tamil nationalism, were 
later exposed for their secret deals with the 
government. "For those who've profited 
personally by playing both sides in the political 
arena, this could be a bitter pill to swallow," 
another observer noted. "And this might 
just be the beginning—more skeletons could 
tumble out of closets soon."
