hile the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK) Central Committee had 
officially thrown its weight behind Sajith 
Premadasa, and Sritharan—embroiled in a 
heated leadership struggle—rallied behind the 
so-called common Tamil candidate, Mavai 
Senathirajah, who had initially leaned towards 
supporting the common Tamil candidate, 
decided to stir things up by siding with 
President Ranil Wickremesinghe. In a twist 
straight out of a political thriller, Senathirajah 
didn't just back Wickremesinghe; he placed 
the Tamil ethnic question squarely on the 
President's agenda.
During a high-profile meeting at his residence 
in Tellippalai, Jaffna, Mavai spared no effort 
in the pomp and ceremony. Wickremesinghe

was welcomed with all the 
grandeur of a traditional 
Hindu reception. But 
this wasn't your typical 
handshake-and-smile photo 
op—beneath the rituals, the 
two were all business. Mavai 
made it crystal clear: "This 
isn't just about the election. 
Wickremesinghe's victory is 
about solving the ethnic issue 
that has haunted the Tamil 
community for decades." 
And in a bold move, Mavai 
set a timeline: "Within three 
months, Ranil must deliver a 
political solution—no more 
symbolic gestures. It's time 
for leadership that unites Sri 
Lanka."
If you thought that was the 
height of the drama, think 
again. The next day, the 
political soap opera continued 
when more ITAK leaders—
including Sashikala Raviraj—
appeared at Wickremesinghe's side in Jaffna. 
Along with Mayuran, Sudarshan, Mavai's son 
Kalaiamuthan, and Akilan Muthukumarsamy, 
they submitted a formal proposal to establish 
Chavakachcheri as a separate divisional 
secretariat—a long-standing demand aimed at 
improving local governance. Sashikala proudly 
hailed this as a game-changer for Tamil areas.
But here's where the plot thickens. Credible 
sources say that Sritharan, the fiery ITAK MP 
known for his staunch Tamil nationalist stance, 
had been invited to meet Wickremesinghe at 
Mavai's home. At first, Sritharan agreed and 
even drove toward the meeting, but the sight 
of journalists and photographers outside sent 
him into a full-blown panic. After all, how 
could a hardline Tamil nationalist, who had 
hosted numerous fundraisers abroad for the 
common Tamil candidate, be caught rubbing 
elbows with the Sinhala President? In a move 
fit for a spy thriller, Sritharan swerved at the 
last minute, hiding in a nearby lane to avoid 
the cameras.
But the intrigue didn’t end there. According 
to insiders, President Ranil Wickremesinghe 
reportedly had a private phone conversation 
with Sritharan and Mannar ITAK MP Charles 
Nirmalanathan—right from the house of TNA 
leader Mavai Senathirajah.
A source close to the development told Jaffna 
Monitor that during the conversation, the MPs 
reassured Wickremesinghe, saying, "Iyo sir, 
we are with you. What we do outside is just 
acting."
