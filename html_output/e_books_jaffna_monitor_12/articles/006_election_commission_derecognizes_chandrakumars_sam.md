According to sources from 
the Election Commission, 
the party's appeal was also 
rejected, as there is no 
provision in Sri Lanka for 
appealing the deregistration 
of a political party once it 
has been officially revoked. 
They can only reapply as 
a new party, and Election 
Commission officers 
indicated to Jaffna Monitor 
that there is a high chance 
they may lose their election 
symbol.
Three years ago, Samaththuva 
Kadchi was recognized as 
a political party. However, 
Election Commission officers 
indicate that the party failed 
to submit its financial reports 
for the year 2023. Despite 
receiving several reminders 
from the Commission, the 
party did not comply, leading 
to its derecognition.

Samaththuva Kadchi, included in Government Gazette No. 2395/08 under Section 
7(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 01 of 1981, released on Monday, 
July 29, 2024.

Monitor, the Chairman of the Election Commission of Sri 
Lanka, RMAL Rathnayake, stated, 'Samaththuva Kadchi 
failed to submit its audit report for the previous year. As a 
result, we have deregistered the party. However, they may 
apply again when we open applications for new parties in the 
future.
Samaththuva Kadchi was included in the Government 
Gazette No. 2395/08, released on Monday, July 29, 2024, 
under Section 7(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, 
No. 01 of 1981. The notice listed recognized political parties 
for the upcoming Presidential Election, and Samaththuva 
Kadchi was among them.
However, in the updated 
Gazette No. 2399/14, published 
on Monday, August 26, 2024, 
under Section 27A of the 
Local Authorities Elections 
Ordinance (Chapter 262), 
following the announcement of 
the Embilipitiya local council 
elections, Samaththuva Kadchi 
was removed from the list of 
recognized political parties.
The party with the shield 
as its official symbol is now 
officially derecognized and 
can no longer contest elections 
under its name or symbol. 
Interestingly, just weeks before 
the Presidential Election, 
Chandrakumar's Samaththuva 
Kadchi had declared its 
support for Sajith Premadasa, 
the presidential candidate of 
the Samagi Jana Balawegaya 
(United People's Power).

Election Commission of Sri Lanka.
In Gazette No. 2399/14, published on August 26, 2024, under Section 27A of the 
Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, Samaththuva Kadchi was removed from the 
list of recognized political parties.
