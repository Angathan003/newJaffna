ndia has urged Sri Lanka to implement 
meaningful devolution of powers to 
Provincial Councils, conduct Provincial 
Council elections, and fully enforce the 13th 
Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution. 
Speaking during the 57th session of the UN 
Human Rights Council in Geneva, Gaurav 
Kumar Thakur, Counsellor at the Permanent 
Mission of India, emphasized these steps as 
essential for addressing the ethnic issue and 
ensuring equality, justice, dignity, and peace 
for the Sri Lankan Tamil community.
Thakur emphasized two core principles 
underpinning India's support for Sri Lanka. 
First, the importance of addressing the 
aspirations of the Tamil community, and 
second, the imperative of safeguarding 
Sri Lanka's unity, territorial integrity, 
and sovereignty. He reiterated that a 
comprehensive political solution, including 
the meaningful devolution of powers 
to Provincial Councils, is essential for 
achieving lasting reconciliation in the 
country.
He noted that India has been a steadfast 
partner in supporting Sri Lanka's national 
recovery efforts, providing over USD 4 
billion in assistance in 2022 to help the 
country navigate its economic crisis. India 
also played a key role in collaborating 
with the Sri Lankan government on debt 
restructuring efforts, further strengthening 
bilateral cooperation during this challenging 
period.
While acknowledging recent reconciliation 
efforts by the Sri Lankan government, 
Thakur called for the swift and 
meaningful implementation of Sri Lanka's 
commitments, particularly the full execution 
of the 13th Amendment. This amendment, 
introduced after the India-Sri Lanka Accord 
in 1987, provides for the establishment 
of Provincial Councils and devolution 
of powers to the provinces, but its full 
implementation has faced delays over the 
years.
India expressed hope that the upcoming 
elections in Sri Lanka would further the 
cause of national reconciliation and advance 
the political solution to the ethnic issue, 
reinforcing long-term stability in the island 
nation.
