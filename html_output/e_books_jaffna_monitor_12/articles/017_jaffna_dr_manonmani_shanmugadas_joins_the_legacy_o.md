r. Manonmani Shanmugadas has made 
history as arguably the first Sri Lankan 
Tamil scholar to write a complete commentary 
on the Thirukkural, an ancient Tamil text 
renowned for its ethical teachings. Her 
comprehensive work, which spans over 1,400 
pages, is being celebrated for its contemporary 
clarity and approach.
Known for its profound insights into life and 
ethics, the Thirukkural has seen numerous 
interpretations over the centuries, but Dr 
Manonmani's work is particularly notable 
for its contemporary approach and clarity 
in language. While Dr. Manonmani's 
achievement is groundbreaking for Sri Lankan 
Tamil scholarship.
K.S.V. Lakshmi Ammal, also known as 
Lady Zamindar of Manapparai in Trichy, 
Tamil Nadu, was the first woman to write a 
full Thirukkural commentary, 'Thirukkural 
Deepalankaram', in 1929.
Dr. Shanmugadas dedicated the lockdown 
period during the COVID-19 pandemic 
to producing her commentary, which is a 
comprehensive analysis of the Thirukkural, 
providing word-for-word meanings, detailed 
explanations, and interpretations.
The commentary spans over 1,400 pages and 
is published by Evergreen Publishers in Jaffna, 
priced at LKR 5,000. The significance of this

publication extends beyond its scholarly value. It is also 
Dr. Manonmani's 70th book, released on her 80th birthday 
on 14th October 2023, a remarkable achievement in her 
long literary career.
Her commentary joins a long tradition of respected works 
on the Thirukkural, including those by Parimelazhagar, 
Manakudavar, Mu. Varadarajan, and Solomon Pappaiya, 
making it a valuable addition to Tamil literature.
This new work will likely serve as a timeless gift for future 
generations. Tamil scholars have welcomed the publication 
as an important contribution to the literary world, 
with many hailing Dr Manonmani's efforts to make the 
Thirukkural accessible to a modern audience.

The train service between Colombo and 
Kankesanthurai officially resumed on 
September 14, following the reopening of the 
Mahawa Junction to Anuradhapura railway 
track after an extensive renovation period.
Train No. 4021, an air-conditioned intercity 
express, became the first to traverse the newly 
renovated track, departing Colombo Fort at 
5:35 a.m. and returning from Kankesanthurai 
at 1:20 p.m. the same day. This resumption 
ends a nine-month hiatus on this section of 
the Northern Line, and railway officials have 
confirmed that the number of trains will 
gradually increase. Senior officials told Jaffna 
Monitor that the return of the iconic Yal Devi 
Express is also slated for next week.
In an exclusive conversation with Jaffna 
Monitor, a senior railway official highlighted 
the major upgrades that came with the project. 
"The 66.4 km Mahawa-Anuradhapura stretch 
has undergone significant modernisation, 
including the addition of second 
platforms at key stations like Ambanpola, 
Thambuththegama, and Thalawa, which 
previously had only one platform. This allows 
for smoother operations and reduced delays," 
the official explained.
"Further, stations such as Galgamuwa, 
Shravasthripura, and Randenigama, along 
with Anuradhapura New Town, have been 
upgraded to accommodate trains with up to 
20 carriages. The Mahawa to Anuradhapura 
track now boasts the most advanced signalling 
system in the country, a technological leap 
forward that will drastically cut delays and 
ensure more efficient train operations along 
this critical route," he added.

affna District MP Angajan Ramanathan, 
representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party 
(SLFP) and a key supporter of President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential 
election, has taken sharp aim at the Ilankai 
Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) and prominent 
party figure M.A. Sumanthiran. In a pointed 
critique, Ramanathan questioned whether 
ITAK's decision to offer unconditional support 
to Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa is, 
in fact, a betrayal of the Tamil people. He 
contrasted this move with the more strategic, 
conditional backing Sajith Premadasa received 
from political heavyweights like Rishad 
Bathiudeen and Rauff Hakeem, suggesting that 
ITAK's unreserved support may leave Tamil 
interests at risk.

expressed his discontent. "While Bathiudeen 
and Hakeem have openly stated that their 
support for Premadasa comes with conditions, 
ITAK has chosen to back him unconditionally. 
Isn't this a clear betrayal of the Tamil people?" 
he asked, addressing the crowd.
He urged the Tamil population of the North 
and East to resist efforts to scatter their votes 
and warned them not to be misled by political 
schemes. "This is not merely an election 
rally; it's a gathering of gratitude. President 
Wickremesinghe doesn't need to campaign 
in the Jaffna District—he's already earned the 
trust of the people by steering the country 
through an economic crisis and giving us hope 
for recovery."
Angajan praised Wickremesinghe for his 
leadership during a difficult time, stating, 
"When others shirked responsibility, the 
President stepped up. In just two years, he has 
brought the country back to normalcy. Had he 
not taken control, Sri Lanka could have ended 
up in the same dire straits as Somalia."
With the presidential election looming on 
September 21st, Angajan emphasized the 
critical nature of the decision ahead. "Do we 
rise, or do we fall? The choice is in the hands 
of the people," he said. He also warned that 
ITAK's actions, including MP Sumanthiran's 
hasty declaration of support for Sajith 
Premadasa, are contributing to efforts to divide 
the Tamil vote.
"I personally handed the President the 
longstanding demands of the Tamil people in 
writing, and only after those demands were 
accepted did I offer my support. Sumanthiran, 
on the other hand, gave his backing to the 
Opposition Leader without any conditions—
this is nothing short of a betrayal," Angajan 
charged.
