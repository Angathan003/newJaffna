Thero, the leader of Janasetha Peramuna 
and a candidate in the upcoming presidential 
election issued sharp criticism against 
prominent political figures during a campaign 
event held at the Mannar Bus Station. His 
remarks targeted Tamil political leaders, 
including M.A. Sumanthiran, alleging that 
they are driven by a relentless desire for power 
at the expense of the people.
Addressing the media, Seelarathana 
Thero said, "The future of our motherland 
depends on unity that transcends ethnic and 
religious boundaries. However, leaders like 
Sumanthiran will stop at nothing to secure 
power while the innocent people of the North 
and East continue to suffer."
He further claimed that Tamil political parties 
had aligned themselves with the opposition 
candidate, Sajith Premadasa, warning that

similar patterns of betrayal would follow. 
"Whether it's Sajith Premadasa, President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, or other political leaders like 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Namal Rajapaksa, 
or Dilith Jayaweera, they will all abandon their 
promises once they come to power. The people 
of the North and East must be wary of these 
empty alliances."
The Thero expressed concern that while 
political leaders push their agendas, the 
welfare of the Tamil community in the 
Northern Province remains neglected. "The 
children of these power-hungry leaders enjoy 
privileged lives abroad while their voters are 
left with unresolved issues. It's time the Tamil 
people make informed choices and vote for 
the Janasetha Peramuna, symbolized by the 
tractor, to ensure a prosperous future."
Seelarathana Thero's rally in Mannar 
followed a campaign stop in Jaffna, where 
similar concerns were raised. His supporters 
distributed bilingual leaflets in Sinhala and 
Tamil, detailing his vision and urging voters to 
support his candidacy.
