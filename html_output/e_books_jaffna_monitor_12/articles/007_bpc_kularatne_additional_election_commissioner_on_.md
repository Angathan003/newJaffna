Kularatne, Additional Election 
Commissioner (Legal and Investigation) and 
Attorney-at-Law. Here are some excerpts from 
the interview:
You were directly involved in this 
matter. Could you explain what 
actually happened?
The final day for submitting the accounts for 
2023 was December 31, 2023. Unfortunately, 
Samaththuva Kadchi did not submit the report 
by that date. We gave a four-month period 
to prepare the document, but they did not 
submit the documents during this time. We 
provided another two-month period as a relief. 
Despite sending two reminders, we received 
no response. I even tried to contact them 
personally through the numbers they had 
provided, but those numbers were no longer in 
service.
I submitted the commission paper to the 
Commission, mentioning the situation 
in early July. The Commission then 
instructed me to send an official notice to 
their Kilinochchi office. Subsequently, I 
sent Election Commission officers to their 
office in Kilinochchi, where they met with 
representatives from the party. They stated 
they would submit the report after two more 
months. I informed the Commission of this, 
and they decided to deregister Samaththuva 
Kadchi.
After the deregistration, the party appealed. 
Unfortunately, our system does not allow 
for appeals once a party has been officially 
deregistered, so the appeal was rejected.
Does this mean that Samaththuva 
Kadchi cannot be registered again?
They can only register as a new party when we 
open registrations for new parties.
So they must start a new party?
Yes, they will have to start a new party.
Can they use the same name again?
They can, but I am uncertain about the fate of 
the party's symbol.
