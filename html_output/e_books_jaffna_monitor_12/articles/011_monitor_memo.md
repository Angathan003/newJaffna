n a move that's guaranteed to make election 
authorities break into a cold sweat, a senior 
member of the Eelam People's Revolutionary 
Liberation Front (EPRLF) found himself in hot 
water after proudly posting a marked ballot 
paper on Facebook—because, apparently, 
discretion is overrated.
The said senior party 
member, K. Arunthavarasa 
(alias Mezhikumaran), who 
moonlights as the treasurer 
for a public organization 
backing the common 
Tamil candidate, decided 
to showcase his voting 
prowess on social media 
by uploading a photo of a 
postal ballot marked with 
the conch symbol. The 
incident took place on the 
5th of this month, smack 
in the middle of the postal 
voting days (4th, 5th, and 6th).
Naturally, this whole saga didn't fly under the 
radar. After the Vavuniya District Assistant 
Election Commissioner, and a few sharp-
eyed election monitors spotted the post, the 
Assistant Commissioner wasted no time filing 
a formal complaint with the Vavuniya police.
In classic CSI style, the police swooped in, 
called Arunthavarasa in for a little chat, 
and confiscated his phone. Now, it's off 
for "analysis"—though we can all imagine 
what they'll find: selfies, endless WhatsApp 
forwards, and probably a few theories about 
how the common Tamil 
candidate is beneficial—at 
least financially—to those 
backing him.
Adding to the drama, it 
turns out Arunthavarasa 
isn’t the only one with a 
ballot-paper-photography 
obsession. A teacher 
in Mullaitivu, another 
devoted fan of the 
conch symbol, was also 
arrested for snapping a 
similar photo. Clearly, 
this common Tamil 
candidate and its conch symbol have already 
started causing trouble for their supporters. 
Many in the community are murmuring that, 
with the candidate almost certain to fail, the 
real trouble for the Tamil people will begin 
after the election, as the consequences of yet 
another futile effort unfold.
