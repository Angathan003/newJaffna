Selvanayagam Aravinthan, born on January 
16, 1981, hails from Paranthan, a town in the 
Kilinochchi District. He joined the LTTE in 
2001, working covertly in its intelligence wing 
under the command of Colonel Charles, then 
head of the LTTE's operations in Colombo. 
Credible sources reveal that within the LTTE, 
he was known by the code names "Jones" 
or "Navalan," and also by the name Ananda 
Varman. His role was so secretive that even 
many within the LTTE's intelligence wing 
were unaware of his existence. Though he is 
currently in Weligada Prison, his listed address 
remains Nagapusani Amman Kovil Road, 
Thonikkal, Vavuniya.
Aravinthan played a pivotal role in the 
infamous Claymore mine attack on January 
2, 2008, which targeted an army bus opposite 
the Nippon Hotel on Slave Island (Company

Roads) carrying soldiers. The explosion 
claimed the lives of three soldiers and critically 
injured 10 others. Notably, the attack occurred 
just a day after the assassination of Tamil 
lawmaker T. Maheshwaran of the United 
National Party (UNP) and his bodyguard at 
the Shree Ponnambalaneswaran Sivan Temple 
in Kotahena.
S. Aravinthan stands at the center of a 
sensational scandal after being accused of 
impregnating the 14-year-old daughter of a 
prominent member of the Ex-Combatants 
Welfare Association in Vavuniya. The mother, 
once a member of the LTTE’s medical 
unit and originally from Eachchankulam, 
Shrastirikulankum in Vavuniya, is reported 
to have had a secretive affair with Aravinthan. 
This affair is said to have played a role in the 
eventual breakdown of her marriage.
During this affair, Aravinthan, with the help 
of LTTE proxies and diaspora funds, opened a 
water filter business in Thekkawatte, Vavuniya, 
under the name JV Tube Water Shop. He 
would announce that on the 26th and 27th 
of November, his shop would provide free 
water to the public, as these two days were 
considered significant during the LTTE's 
Heroes' Day commemorations.
Despite the business front, the shop became a 
focal point for his personal entanglements. The 
treasurer managed the shop, and her 14-year-
old daughter frequently visited to spend time 
with her mother.
The daughter, after transferring to a new 
school in Vavuniya town, often stayed at 
Aravinthan's house. Seen as a trusted "uncle" 
figure by the young woman, his home 
became her temporary shelter. According to 
police reports, it was during these stays that 
Aravinthan allegedly manipulated and raped 
the young woman, resulting in her pregnancy.
The girl's pregnancy became evident a 
few weeks ago, and she is now six months 
S. Aravinthan and other members of the Ex-Combatants Welfare Association with ITAK MP S. Shritharan.

pregnant. Initially, police sources suggest that 
her family attempted to cover up the situation, 
but they eventually filed a formal complaint 
against S. Aravinthan.
Sources indicate that Aravinthan is one of 
many individuals in the region who rely 
heavily on diaspora funds. He is reportedly 
receiving crores of rupees through his 
Thayagam Sports Club, Agni Thruvangal 
organization, and the Ex-Combatants Welfare 
Association. A few years ago, with substantial 
funding from the diaspora, he formed an 
independent group called the Liberation Tigers 
People's Forum to contest an election, but his 
group failed miserably in the polls.
He has also been a key organizer of the LTTE's 
Great Heroes' Day and the funeral of Rajiv 
Gandhi's assassination accused, Shanthan. 
Credible reports suggest that when Shanthan's 
body arrived in Colombo, Aravinthan 
organized a rally in Vavuniya, which led 
other LTTE proxies and supporters to hold 
similar rallies in Kilinochchi, Jaffna, and other 
areas. According to reliable sources within 
his organization, Aravinthan is suspected 
of embezzling crores of rupees during these 
events.
Aravinthan is reportedly in contact with 
controversial Tamil Nadu politicians, including 
Seeman, and sources indicate that he traveled 
to India specifically to meet him. Additionally, 
it is alleged that Aravinthan maintains 
ongoing communication with segments of 
the diaspora and LTTE-affiliated proxies, who 
provide financial support with the intention 
of fomenting unrest in Sri Lanka. These 
claims have raised serious concerns about his 
activities and connections, both locally and 
internationally.
