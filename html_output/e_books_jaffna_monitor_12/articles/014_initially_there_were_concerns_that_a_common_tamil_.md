these destructive ideologies. Even within our 
party, a few individuals are often gripped by 
fear—'What if the diaspora cuts off financial 
support?'—which only adds to the challenges 
we face. It's an issue we need to tackle directly. 
And the irony? I know of a few youths who, 
under the cover of night, call our ITAK 
leaders, pretending to be diaspora professors, 
and our leaders actually listen to them out of 
respect. It's almost comical.
What should the diaspora do , 
according to you?
The diaspora should refrain from interfering 
in decision-making processes. It is essential for 
them to recognize that the people living in Sri 
Lanka must be the ones who determine their 
own future. The role of the diaspora should 
be to provide support and assistance rather 
than exerting direct influence. Many diaspora 
groups understand this well, and they always 
consult with local leadership before making 
any decisions, ensuring that their actions align 
with the needs of the people here.
However, there are some within the diaspora 
who pursue their own agendas and expect us 
to follow suit. This is a misguided approach. 
For example, the concept of a "Transnational 
Government of Tamil Eelam" is a political 
stance that we do not share. While such a 
position may seem right for them, it does 
not align with the realities we face here. 
They may believe in the idea of establishing 
a government abroad, but we are focused on 
finding solutions within the framework of this 
country. Their policies, while perhaps well-
intentioned, do not fit our context, and it is 
unreasonable for them to expect us to work 
towards their objectives.
The diaspora must understand they should not 
impose a separate agenda on those living in Sri 
Lanka. Their role is to support the community 
here, not to dictate or determine the future 
course of action. The people on the ground 
must be allowed to lead and make decisions 
based on their own lived experiences and 
needs.

Note: We conducted this interview with M.A. 
Sumanthiran a few days before the official 
announcement of ITAK supporting presidential 
candidate Sajith Premadasa. Following the 
announcement, we reached out to Sumanthiran 
multiple times for feedback, as we were 
concerned that the interview might spark 
controversy. Unfortunately, all our attempts to 
contact him were unsuccessful.
