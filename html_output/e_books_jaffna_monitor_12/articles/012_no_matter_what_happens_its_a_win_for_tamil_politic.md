n a textbook case of Tamil 
political opportunism, 
S. Sritharan, Member of 
Parliament for Jaffna-
Kilinochchi and one of the 
two key figures caught in 
the leadership tussle within 
the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (ITAK) has spun 
a narrative that seems a bit 
hard for anyone to swallow. 
According to Sritharan, no 
matter the outcome of the 
Presidential Election, the 
Tamil people—thanks to their 
Tamil Common Candidate, 
Pakkiyaselvam Ariyanethran—will emerge 
victorious. It's an argument that could be 
described as political manoeuvring at its finest 
(or worst), depending on who you ask.
Speaking during a recent trip to London, 
Sritharan told a radio station, "The Tamil 
Common Candidate is not just an individual. 
It is a symbol of the Tamil nation. This symbol 
will open a great path for the Tamil people in 
the future. Therefore, this is just the beginning, 
not the end." It sounded grand enough, but 
what Sritharan seemed to be hinting at was 
that even if Ariyanethran doesn't win big, it's 
still a triumph.
"Even if Ariyanethran secures 8-10 lakh votes, 
it won't be a traditional win. Instead, it will 
be seen as a mandate from the Tamil people. 
If he gets 51% of the votes in the Northern 
and Eastern districts, that's our real victory,"

Sritharan explained, painting a picture where 
the bar for success is so flexible it's almost as if 
he knows it will never happen.
And if Ariyanethran doesn't secure those 
votes? Well, Sritharan is ready to spin that too. 
"This election isn't about making a Tamil the 
President. There's no history where we lost the 
presidency just because we didn't get enough 
votes," he added, subtly lowering expectations. 
Apparently, victory here is less about the actual 
result and more about "sending a message"—a 
message that Sritharan insists is about 
reclaiming Tamil sovereignty and setting the 
stage for future political struggles.
But just in case this round doesn't go as 
planned, Sritharan hinted there would be 
plenty more opportunities ahead. "We should 
continue fielding a Tamil Common Candidate 
in future elections, whether it's Ariyanethran 
or someone else. This will force southern 
political parties and Sinhala leaders to realize 
that the Tamil people have serious political 
issues that need solutions."
In the end, Sritharan's approach seems to 
be a masterclass in ensuring that, no matter 
the outcome—win, lose, or somewhere in 
between—the Tamil political camp, and 
more importantly, he and the leaders backing 
the Tamil Common Candidate, walk away 
claiming a victory of sorts. Whether anyone 
else buys into that optimistic narrative, 
however, remains to be seen.
In a recent interview, incumbent President and 
presidential candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe 
took aim at the National People's Power (NPP) 
manifesto, highlighting contradictions and 
unclear policies.
Wickremesinghe humorously remarked, "It 
took a whole night to read its 232 pages—
it's not an easy task." He pointed out a 
fundamental inconsistency in NPP leader 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake's economic vision, 
noting that while Dissanayake advocates for 
an export-oriented economy, the manifesto 
proposes cancelling free trade agreements, 
which are essential for such a strategy.
The President also drew attention to internal 
disagreements within the NPP on economic 
policies, referencing figures like Sunil 
Handunneththi and Dr. Suriyapperuma, who 
have criticized the Economic Transformation 
Bill. Wickremesinghe expressed concern 
about the NPP's approach to printing money, 
warning, "If money is printed, the system will 
collapse, and I don't see any benefit from it."
He then extended a challenge to Dissanayake 
for a debate but called for clarity on whether 
the NPP supports an export-oriented or 
import-oriented economy. "Once that's clear, 
we can talk to the IMF and have a proper 
debate," Wickremesinghe added, setting the 
stage for a potential economic showdown.
