The Galle Court has reawakened a chapter from the 2009 
conflict by issuing a summons to a Kilinochchi local 
whose motorcycle was lost in the devastating last stand 
at Mullivaikkal. In the war's harrowing climax, numerous 
Tamils abandon their vehicles amidst the turmoil. From 
personal motorcycles to larger conveyances like lorries and 
buses, these vehicles, integral to the fabric of daily life, 
were left behind, never to be reclaimed by their rightful 
owners.
There have been persistent reports that many such vehicles, 
orphaned in the chaos, found their way into the hands of 
army personnel and were subsequently taken to Sri Lanka's 
southern regions. This long-standing allegation has hung in 
the air, a specter of the wartime losses endured.
Now, in a twist that defies the passage of time, the 
motorcycle of the Kilinochchi resident has surfaced, 
implicated in an incident of theft. This unexpected recovery 
has prompted judicial authorities to act, leading the Galle 
Court to extend a formal summons to the vehicle's owner. 
After an interlude of 14 years, the owner is called to attend 
a hearing.
The unfolding narrative surrounding the Kilinochchi local's 
motorcycle, lost during the tumultuous final phase of the 
2009 conflict at Mullivaikkal, raises profound questions 
about the wartime fates of numerous vehicles abandoned 
by Tamils. As this motorcycle reemerges, implicated in 
a theft in Sri Lanka's southern region, it not only revives 
painful memories but also triggers a perplexing inquiry: 
How did a vehicle traversing Vanni's heartland until 2009 
find its way to the south?
This enigma is central to the Galle Court's proceedings. 
By summoning the rightful owner, the court must delve 
deeper, seeking clarity on the motorcycle's journey from 
the war-ravaged landscapes of the North to its unexpected 
reappearance in the South. This inquiry isn't about 
establishing the current circumstances surrounding the 
theft incident. It's a quest to unravel the broader, more 
complex narratives of loss and displacement, the silent 
odysseys of inanimate witnesses like this motorcycle. 
Such investigations are essential to address the lingering 
shadows of war, ensuring that the owner's summons is not 
just a procedural formality but a step towards uncovering a 
fragment of the conflict's obscured history.
