redible reports received by 'Jaffna Monitor' suggest 
that the individual allegedly impersonating 
Duaraka is Mithuja Rajaratnam, who also goes by 
the aliases Nithya and Suja. She is currently residing 
in Arbon, Thurgau, Switzerland. This individual 
is reputed for her extensive history of engaging in 
deceptive practices. She has reportedly been involved 
in several fraudulent marriages, employing a tactic 
commonly referred to as the 'honey trap' method, 
through which she has illegally obtained significant 
sums of money. In a notable incident a few years ago, 
she was accused of fraudulently claiming to be the 
daughter of Rajarathinam, a distinguished Tamil-
American businessman.
In-depth investigations have begun to reveal the 
breadth of her financial frauds. Central to her strategy 
has been the exploitation of young individuals 
through romantically charged relationships, leading 
to substantial monetary scams. A striking example 
of her modus operandi was uncovered involving a 
young man originally from Jaffna, now residing in 
Melbourne, Australia. The individual, who arrived in 
Australia by boat and built a life through hard work, 
encountered her on Facebook. This meeting led him 
into a deceptive relationship, where under the guise 
of love, he was defrauded of a significant amount 
of money. The pretext was the acquisition of Swiss 
citizenship and a house in Switzerland as part of their 
marriage plans. The victim has confirmed the transfer

of 60,000 Australian dollars to her, providing concrete 
evidence of the fraudulent transaction.
The 'Thurgau Impostor' case is not an isolated 
incident but part of a pattern of manipulation that 
has affected numerous individuals. Her ability to 
weave intricate webs of deceit, capitalizing on the 
emotional vulnerabilities of her victims, poses serious 
questions about the security of online interactions 
and the potential risks involved. As the investigation 
continues, more layers of this complex network of 
deception are expected to be unveiled, shedding light 
on the extensive impact of her actions on the lives of 
her unsuspecting victims.
Her journey into the world of fraud began with her 
marriage to a former driver of the LTTE leader, 
Prabhakaran. Post-war, She and her husband 
sought refuge in Malaysia via India. It was here 
that her latent aptitude for scamming surfaced. 
Utilizing the expansive reach of Facebook, she 
crafted a series of romantic illusions, ensnaring 
unsuspecting young men in her fraudulent net. Her 
matrimonial life was characterized by a succession of 
marriages, intriguingly linked to individuals close to 
Prabhakaran, placing her in a strategic position within 
an intricate network of ex-combatants. In Malaysia, 
her deceptions took on a new dimension. She claimed 
to be the neglected daughter of Rajarathinam, a well-
known Tamil American businessman, and under this 
pretext, she defrauded numerous individuals, weaving 
tales of a legal battle for inheritance and promises of 
lucrative returns.
Her relocation to Switzerland did not dampen her 
fraudulent activities. Continuing her operations 
through Facebook, she exploited sensitive issues 
such as aiding female combatants, assisting women 
recovering from military abuse, and rescuing 
kidnapped female fighters. These humanitarian facades 
masked her real intent â€“ financial gain through deceit.
Her most daring deception involved assuming the 
identity of 'Duwaraka,' claiming to be the offspring of 
Prabhakaran and Mathivathani, who are now hiding 
and needing financial aid. This claim represents the 
pinnacle of her elaborate scheme of falsehoods. In a 
twist to this saga, it has been revealed that a significant 
accomplice in the 'Duwaraka drama' shared a personal 
bond with her, indicating a deeper layer of collusion 
in these schemes. This relationship suggests a complex 
web of mutual deceit and manipulation.
Beyond exploiting romantic entanglements, her 
deceptive strategies reportedly extend to politically 
charged frauds, particularly capitalizing on the 
sensitive topic of the Eelam liberation struggle. In 
contrast to her involvement in other scams where she 
may have acted alone, in the case of the Duvaraga 
impersonation, she is believed to be part of a network 
of individuals who are masters at manipulation. 
As per sources, authorities and affected individuals are 
diligently monitoring the evolving situation, keenly 
focused on unraveling the full scope and intricacies of 
the alleged impersonation and fraud. This vigilance is 
heightened by the acknowledgment of her association 
with a highly skilled group adept in such deceptive 
practices. The unfolding developments in this case 
are anticipated to shed further light on the magnitude 
and sophistication of the scam, emphasizing the 
critical need for awareness and caution in similar 
circumstances.
