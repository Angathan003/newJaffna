JB MP Harsha de Silva recently 
expressed deep concerns about the 
impact of an 18% VAT on Sri Lanka's 
farming sector. This new tax, applicable 
to agricultural machinery, equipment, 
and inputs, including chemical 
fertilizers, is expected to heavily burden 
farmers. He noted that essential dairy 
products such as liquid milk and eggs 
are also subject to this tax.
Harsha de Silva highlighted the 
detrimental effects on rice farming, 
where farmers are being pushed to grow 
lower-yield varieties like keeri samba, 
reducing productivity. He anticipates 
significant impacts by March 2024.
Reflecting on his previous tenure, 
Harsha de Silva mentioned initiating 
the Shakthi Rice program to support 
small and medium-scale rice millers. 
Despite initial success, the program 
was discontinued under Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa's administration.
Harsha de Silva also pointed out 
the stark rise in the cost of living, 
with a family of four now needing 
over Rs 170,000 for a standard 
previously maintained at Rs 90,000. 
He emphasized the increased economic 
hardship despite improved supply 
chains.
Addressing Sri Lanka's economic 
challenges, Harsha de Silva stressed 
the need for strategic planning and 
a corruption-free approach to avoid 
dependency on institutions like the IMF, 
similar to India's strategy since 1991. 
His comments call for urgent economic 
and agricultural reforms to stabilize and 
rejuvenate Sri Lanka's economy and 
farming sector.
