More Than Just Numbers
More Than Just Numbers
The Vice-Chancellor's stance on the diverse but 
non-local student enrolment in the Engineering 
Faculty overlooks the fundamental purpose of 
the faculty's establishment. It was envisioned 
as an embodiment of the hopes and educational 
ambitions of the Jaffna community. The 
responsibility of the university's leadership extends 
beyond maintaining enrolment numbers; it involves 
nurturing the faculty as a beacon of academic 
excellence and opportunity for the local populace.
The Need for Proactive Leadership
Jaffna University, particularly its Engineering 
Faculty, was established to serve not just the 
academic community but also to fulfil the 
aspirations of the people of Jaffna. The leadership's 
current approach, which appears indifferent to 
the declining interest of local students, is a matter 
of concern. The university should not be a mute 
spectator but a dynamic force, actively seeking 
ways to engage and attract the students it was 
intended to serve.
Strategies for Revitalization
Jaffna Monitor Magazine advocates for the 
university to adopt innovative strategies to rekindle 
local interest:
Curricular Innovations: Tailor engineering 
programs to reflect Jaffna's students' unique needs 
and interests, making the faculty more relevant and 
appealing.
Community Engagement: Forge stronger 
connections with local schools and community 
leaders to understand and address the root causes of 
the declining local interest.
Targeted Awareness Campaigns: Implement 
marketing strategies highlighting the faculty's 
achievements and potential, showcasing its 
relevance to the local community.
Leveraging Alumni Networks: Engage alumni in 
mentorship and outreach programs, demonstrating 
the faculty's impact and opportunities to 
prospective students.
Upholding the Dream
The Engineering Faculty of Jaffna University was 
born out of a collective dream, symbolizing more 
than an academic establishment. It represents 
hope, progress, and the aspirations of the Jaffna 
people. The university's leadership must recognize 
and honour this sentiment by actively working to 
ensure the faculty remains a symbol of pride and 
opportunity for the local community.
While understanding the practicalities of running 
an educational institution, Jaffna Monitor Magazine 
urges the university's leadership to revisit and 
realign with its foundational vision. By doing so, 
they can ensure that the Engineering Faculty not 
only thrives but also continues to embody the 
dreams and aspirations of the people it was built to 
serve.
