he purported emergence of a new Dwaraka 
has brought to light the family feud between 
Thiruvenkadam Velupillai's family (Prabhakaran's 
family) and the Erambu family (Mathivathani's 
family, with Erambu being Mathivathani's father).
Arunadevi Kumaradas, also known as Aruna, the 
elder sister of Mathivathani, who is married to 
Prabhakaran, made a public statement in August. She 
claimed to have met Prabhakaran, Mathivathani, and 
Dwaraka at an undisclosed location and confirmed 
they were safe and alive. This assertion, particularly 
from Mathivathani's sister, ignited significant debate 
and speculation about their current activities. Aruna 
reinforced her claim through a video on YouTube 
and various social media platforms, stating that 
Mathivathani and Dwaraka were alive and well. 
Concurrently, there were discussions regarding 
Aruna's mental health, with some sources suggesting 
she might be mentally unstable, potentially 
influencing her to make such extraordinary claims. 
However, a month later, Aruna reappeared in another 
YouTube video announcing that Dwaraka would 
deliver a speech on Great Heroes' Day, or Maveerar 
Nal. In this interview, she emphasized that Dwaraka, 
like her father Prabhakaran, was committed to 
advocating for the rights of Tamils.
On the morning of November 27, Sritharan Aerembu, 
Mathivathani's elder brother, announced on his

Facebook page that a policy declaration speech by 
Duwaraka would be released later that evening. This 
announcement was part of an active campaign that 
Sritharan had been leading on Facebook to support his 
sister Aruna's claim that Mathivathani, her husband 
Prabhakaran, and their niece Dwaraka were alive 
and safe. In the evening, as debates and questions 
about Dwaraka's authenticity intensified, Sritharan 
robustly defended the claim on Facebook, insisting 
that the person in the video was Duwaraka. He 
supported his stance by posting several messages on 
the topic. Additionally, Sritharan responded to genuine 
observers who highlighted differences between the 
real Dwaraka and the individual in the November 
27 speech. Despite these observers pointing out 
discrepancies, Sritharan dismissed 
their observations, ridiculing them 
as fools and downplaying the noted 
physical feature differences.
Amid this tumultuous situation, 
Karthik Manokaran, the son of 
Manokaran, who is Prabhakaran's 
elder brother, leveled a serious 
allegation against the Erambu family. 
He suggested that Aruna might be 
involved, either directly or indirectly, 
with a group purportedly exploiting 
LTTE sympathizers, allegedly 
amassing over 5000 crores. Karthik also expressed 
concerns about efforts to undermine his uncle 
Prabhakaran's legacy for personal gain. Countering 
Aruna's claims that Prabhakaran, Mathivathani, 
and Dwaraka are alive, Karthik Manokaran raised 
doubts by questioning why neither Prabhakaran 
nor Mathivathani have appeared in any videos 
to substantiate these assertions. Furthermore, he 
disclosed that his attempts to contact Aruna and 
her relatives for information about Dwaraka were 
unsuccessful, as no one responded to his numerous 
calls.
Addressing the claims of Dwaraka's survival, Karthik 
expresses his readiness to verify her identity. He 
suggests that if allowed to meet the person alleging 
to be Dwaraka, he could employ cross-questioning 
to ascertain her true identity, as he had spoken with 
the actual Dwaraka many times before 2009. He 
further emphasizes that he and his father, Manokaran, 
are prepared to undergo DNA testing to confirm the 
legitimacy of these claims.
These allegations and counterclaims have intensified 
a family feud between Thiruvenkadam Velupillai's 
family (Prabhakaran's) and the Erambu family 
(Mathivathani's family. This feud adds another layer 
to the ongoing narrative and complexities surrounding 
the legacy of the LTTE and its leaders.
