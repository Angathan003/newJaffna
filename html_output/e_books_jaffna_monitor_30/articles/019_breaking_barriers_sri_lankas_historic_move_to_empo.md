n a trailblazing move for Sri Lanka's military, State 
Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon has 
unveiled an ambitious plan to shatter the glass ceiling in the 
armed forces. Under this new initiative, women can climb 
to the apex of military leadership, potentially heading the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force. This is a significant departure 
from the current scenario where women in the Army are 
restricted to the rank of major.
This policy revision is not just a rule change; it's a historic 
stride towards gender parity, reflecting a deep-seated 
recognition of women's capabilities in national defense. 
The plan gains even more resonance against Sri Lanka's 
military history. In the past, the LTTE, known for its role in 
the Sri Lankan Civil War, had integrated women into high-
ranking positions, with figures like Vidusha and Thurga 
reaching the rank of brigadier.
By rewriting military laws to foster gender equality, the 
Sri Lankan government is not just making a statement 
about women's roles in defense; it's redefining them. This 
initiative aligns Sri Lanka with global trends advocating 
for inclusivity in defense forces and acknowledges the 
vital contributions women can make at the highest levels 
of military command. This progressive step signifies a 
new era in Sri Lanka's military, where gender barriers 
are dismantled, and leadership is defined by merit and 
capability, regardless of gender.
