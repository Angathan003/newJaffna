n a recent interview with Jaffna Monitor magazine, 
the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jaffna, S. 
Srisatkunarajah, offered a candid perspective on the 
notable absence of local students in the university's 
Engineering Faculty. Labelling this trend as a form of 
"madness" towards Colombo, he provided insights into 
the university's current enrolment dynamics and broader 
societal preferences.
Diverse Enrolment, Yet Local Absence
The vice chancellor acknowledged the decline in student 
enrollment from the local Jaffna district in the university's 
engineering faculty. However, he pointed out that the 
faculty continues to attract a diverse student body from 
other Tamil-speaking regions, such as Trincomalee, 
Mannar, and even Colombo. "The faculty has not 
experienced a shortage of students," he affirmed. "Our 
focus is not on who is studying in the faculty, as long as 
we get enough students to run the course effectively. Our 
institution remains open and welcoming to students of all 
ethnicities, religious backgrounds, and districts.
The Vice-Chancellor highlighted the Engineering Faculty's 
diverse student body, emphasizing its appeal beyond the 
local Jaffna district. "While we have noticed a decline in 
enrolment from Jaffna, the faculty is attracting students 
from other Tamil-speaking regions like Trincomalee, 
Mannar, and even Tamil-speaking students from 
Colombo," he stated. He underscored this point by 
mentioning that a top student from Colombo's prestigious 
Ananda College is currently studying in the Engineering 
Faculty. "This diversity in our student population is a 
testament to the faculty's quality and appeal. It's only the 
students from Jaffna who have not applied," he added.
Srisatkunarajah expressed his views on the deep-
rooted preference of Jaffna residents for Colombo. He 
questioned the inclination of people from Jaffna to 
invest in properties in Colombo and the suburbs rather 
than their own region. "This pattern extends beyond 
educational choices and reflects a broader societal trend," 
he remarked.
Highlighting the achievements of the Engineering 
Faculty, the Vice-Chancellor proudly noted that it is 
one of the few faculties that have gained significant 
recognition within a few years of its inception. "We are 
proud of the progress and the quality of education we 
offer," he said.
