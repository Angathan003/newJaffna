uwaraga was named after the LTTE fighter Mayuran, whose real 
name was Gunasingarasa Duvaragan. He served as a bodyguard 
for the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and his wife, Mathivathani. 
Mayuran was renowned for his proficiency in pistol shooting, a skill 
that endeared him to Prabhakaran.
Originally from Mesala South in Jaffna, Mayuran attended St. John's 
College before joining the LTTE. He was known for his very short 
stature and diminutive build. His life ended on February 14th, 1985, 
during a battle in Kokkilai. The LTTE claimed to have overrun an army 
camp in this battle, allegedly killing around 200 soldiers. However, 
this number was disputed within LTTE sources, suggesting possible 
exaggeration. Though the victory in this battle remains debatable, it 
had a significant psychological impact on the army and the Sri Lankan 
government. The discovery of LTTE fighters' bodies wearing LTTE 
uniforms was a stark indication of their organization and preparedness. 
This led Ravi Jayewardene, the son of then-President JR Jayewardene, 
to describe the LTTE as a 'sophisticated enemy,' underscoring the 
evolving nature of the conflict and the formidable challenge posed by 
the LTTE.
The battle at Kokkilai not only resulted in the deaths of 16 LTTE 
fighters but also sheds light on the complex and poignant story of 
Lieutenant Simon, whose real name was Canagaratnam Ranjan. 
Canagaratnam, Ranjan's father, was a Member of Parliament for 
the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). He stood as the TULF's 
candidate for Pottuvil in the 1977 parliamentary election, where he 
came second and subsequently entered Parliament as the second 
member for Pottuvil. He defected to the United National Party-led 
government in December 1977. His decision to switch allegiances was 
rewarded when he was appointed the District Minister for Batticaloa.
However, this political move led to a tragic end. On January 24th, 1978, 
Canagaratnam was shot outside his home in Kollupitiya, Colombo. 
The attack was blamed on V. Prabhakaran and Uma Maheswaran. 
Canagaratnam succumbed to his injuries on April 20th, 1980.
Ranjan's decision to join the LTTE, the group responsible for his 
father's assassination, highlights the complex motivations in conflict 
zones. Driven by the desire for a separate nation, many youths, like 
Ranjan, prioritized their cause over personal history. His involvement 
in the Kokkilai battle, where he and 16 LTTE fighters perished, 
underlines the tragic and paradoxical nature of such conflicts.
