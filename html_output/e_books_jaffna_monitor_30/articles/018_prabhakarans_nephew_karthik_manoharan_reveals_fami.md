n a revelatory interview with Thanthi TV, Karthik 
Manoharan, nephew of the infamous Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader Prabhakaran, 
unveiled startling insights into the family's inner 
workings, particularly concerning the enigmatic figure 
of Duwaraka.
The Curious Case of the Imposter
Central to this tale of intrigue is the contentious 
broadcast that featured a woman claiming to be 
Duwaraka, Prabhakaran's daughter. Karthik, son of 
Prabhakaran's elder brother Manoharan, expressed 
firm skepticism about the woman's identity. His 
doubts stemmed from glaring disparities in her 
physical appearance, linguistic usage, and vocal 
characteristics. For instance, the woman's attire 
and full makeup during the solemn Maveerar Naal 
contrasted starkly with the real Duwaraka's known 
persona. Additionally, her speech was riddled with 
pronunciation errors and linguistic inconsistencies, 
uncharacteristic of someone raised in Eelam, where 
Duwaraka spent her formative years.
A Web of Communication and Family Ties
Delving into the past, Karthik recounted the family's 
communication dynamics until early 2009, detailing 
the last known contacts with his cousins Charles 
Anthony and Mathivathani. He lamented the 
impossibility of contacting Uncle Prabhakaran during 
the conflict's peak, painting a picture of a family 
caught in the throes of war.
Contradictions and Conflicts within the Family
The interview also touched upon the complex 
relationships within Prabhakaran's family. Karthik 
highlighted the strong bond between his father, 
Manoharan, and Prabhakaran, which deepened when 
Prabhakaran's parents returned to Sri Lanka in 2003. 
This return was a poignant moment, marking a 
reunion after years of separation.
However, the family narrative is not without its 
contradictions. Aruna, Mathivathani's elder sister, 
made a jarring announcement in August 2023 
claiming that Prabhakaran and his family were still 
alive, a stark contrast to her vehement denial of 
similar claims earlier that year. Karthik also refuted 
former MP Sivajilingam's claims of financial support 
for the family, clarifying that it was his father and 
aunts who shouldered the responsibility.

n a recent social media post, A significant 
part of LTTE supporters who denounce 
that the person who appeared in the video is 
not the real Duwaraka have drawn a symbolic 
distinction between the real Duwaraka, 
daughter of Velupillai Prabhakaran, and the 
woman in a video claiming to be her. The post 
headlined the difference between the Seethevi 
and Moodevi. They idolize the real Duwaraka 
as Seethevi, a symbol of grace and virtue. On 
the other hand, the woman in the video is 
likened to Moodevi, a figure of misfortune.
They say Real Duwaraka has bow-shaped 
eyebrows, dark eyes with lower eyelids 
touching, and spread-out ears, while the 
woman in the video has unbent eyebrows like 
freshwater shrimp, upper eyelids engulfing half 
of the dark eyes, and flattened ears. This post 
reflects their belief that the woman in the video 
fails to embody, physically, the true essence of 
their leader's daughter.
The Mystery of the Imposter Deepens
Adding to the intrigue is the imposter claiming to be 
Duwaraka, who falsely professed to have received 
blessings from Manoharan. This assertion, Karthik 
insists, is entirely baseless.
The Pursuit of Truth and Closure
Amid these revelations, Aruna's sudden inaccessibility 
after her controversial announcement adds another 
layer of mystery. Karthik believes that had 
Prabhakaran been alive, he would have surely reached 
out to his brother, underscoring the profound trust 
within the family.
Confronting Allegations and Embracing Truth
In a bid to confront the swirling allegations and 
unravel the truth, Karthik and his father are prepared 
to undergo DNA testing. This move is a testament to 
their commitment to dispelling the falsehoods that 
have long clouded the family's narrative. The quest for 
truth and closure continues as the Tamil community 
and the world grapple with these revelations.
