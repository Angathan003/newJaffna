n 1984, Kasi Anandan moved to India with his family, 
including his wife Saroja and daughters Amutha Nila 
and Ten Alli. They settled in Royapettah, in the central 
part of Chennai. Saroja, a nurse, secured a well-paying job 
at Chennai's Wellington Hospital. Additionally, the LTTE 
provided a monthly stipend of 2000 INR to the family, a 
notable sum compared to the modest provisions typically 
allocated to LTTE fighters.
Kasi Anandan augmented his income with speaking 
engagements and donations from the Tamil diaspora. 
Despite the modest lifestyle typical of LTTE members, a 
person tasked with delivering the LTTE's funds to Anandan 
told the 'Jaffna Monitor' that Anandan led a comfortable 
life in Chennai.
The LTTE recognized Anandan as a key recruiter for the 
Tamil Eelam cause, emphasizing his influential 
role in inspiring young people. His songs and 
poems were so compelling that many were 
motivated to leave their studies, families, and 
careers to join the LTTE and fight for the vision 
of an independent Tamil Eelam.
Contrastingly, Anandan prioritized education 
for his daughters. While his work inspired many 
youths to join the LTTE, often at significant 
personal cost, he ensured that his daughters 
Amutha Nila and Ten Alli pursued academic 
excellence. They studied medicine, secured seats 
in a medical college under an Indian government 
quota for Sri Lankan refugees, and became 
doctors. This dichotomy between his public 
advocacy and his personal choices for his family 
underscores a complex aspect of Anandan's life.
Following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi 
by the LTTE on Indian soil, Anandan was 
subjected to intense scrutiny by the Indian 
government. Former LTTE fighters, who had 
trained and lived in India, discussed with the 
Jaffna Monitor Anandan's ability to live and support his 
family in India after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. They 
firmly believed that Anandan collaborated with Indian 
intelligence, suggesting that his comfortable lifestyle 
in India was feasible only with governmental support, 
despite the prevalent hostility towards the LTTE during 
that period. This belief adds another layer of complexity 
to Anandan's life, hinting at a possible covert relationship 
with Indian authorities while he publicly supported Tamil 
Eelam. They also claimed that the government quota for 
Sri Lankan refugees was discontinued after Anandan's 
daughters completed their medical education, although this 
claim could not be independently verified by the Jaffna 
Monitor. This speculation further contributes to the intrigue 
surrounding Anandan's story.
