my view, just as Mullivaikal Remembrance Day is solemnly 
observed by Sri Lankan Tamils to honor the civilians who 
perished during the final phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War, 
and similarly, Martyrs' Day is commemorated on November 
27 to remember the fallen LTTE fighters, it is imperative to 
also recognize the significance of the Verugal massacre. 
This tragic event, where the Vanni Tigers targeted their 
Eastern counterparts, should be marked as a day of 
remembrance. Commemorating this day serves as a solemn 
reminder of the internal conflicts' devastating impacts and 
could foster a spirit of reconciliation and unity among the 
Tamil community.
This day emphasizes that such brutal killings should never 
recur in Tamil history. It is not a stance against the people 
of Jaffna, but rather against the 'Jaffna-centric thinking' of 
the LTTE leadership, which led to the deaths of our fighters. 
These individuals were targeted solely because they were 
from the eastern part of Tamil Eelam.
The massacre reflects the LTTE's cruel mindset and tactics, 
which significantly alienated Eastern Tamils and fighters 
from the Vanni group.
Had the Eastern fighters not separated from the Vanni 
Tigers, the conflict might have continued, potentially

leading to a catastrophe in the East similar 
to Mullivaikal, with countless innocent lives 
lost. This division, in fact, served as a critical 
intervention. 
In my view, these Eastern LTTE fighters, killed 
by the Vanni Tigers, were true martyrs. Their 
sacrifice exposed the LTTE's true nature, 
helping us in the East to distance ourselves 
from the LTTE and Prabhakaran's extremism, 
which ultimately prevented a large-scale 
massacre like Mullivaikal in Eastern Sri Lanka.
When these fighters were brutally killed, 
politicians from the Tamil National Alliance 
(TNA), whether from the North or the 
East, remained silent, likely due to fear of 
Prabhakaran and the LTTE. This silence 
brought us to a pivotal point where the Eastern 
people had to determine their own political 
path, leading to the formation of Eastern Tamil 
politics and Eastern-centric political parties.

They killed my son
My name is Nallathampi 
Sivakumar, and I reside in the small 
town of Sittandy. I am a father 
mourning the irreplaceable loss 
of my son, Nishanthan, known as 
Iniyavan, within the LTTE ranks. 
He was the precious light of my 
life, born after four daughters, and 
naturally held an exceptionally 
tender place in my heart. From the 
moment he arrived in this world, 
he was special.
At the tender age of 13, my son 
was swept into the LTTE in 
2003, his youth consumed by the 
complexities of civil strife. After 
Karuna Amman's split from the 
LTTE, my son returned home, 
seeking refuge from the conflict. 
However, the Vanni Tigers 
relentlessly pursued those loyal to 
Karuna Amman, and tragically, 
they targeted my son. Like him, 
hundreds of other innocent 
young men—the sons of grieving 
fathers—fell victim to the violence 
perpetrated by the Vanni Tigers.
Since that fateful day, every dawn 
brings an unbearable weight, a 
constant reminder of the void 
his absence has created. Our 
family trudges through each day, 
burdened by the immense sorrow 
of his loss. Our home, once filled 
with his laughter and dreams, 
now echoes with silence and the 
heartbreak of what could have 
been. The pain is unrelenting, a 
sorrow deep and vast as the ocean. 
We are left to navigate this altered 
existence, forever changed, forever 
diminished, by the loss of my 
beloved son, Nishanthan.

Mumbai Indians have won five IPL titles, which is a whopping 
1/3 championship frequency. This achievement signifies 
unimaginable excellence in a league of such competition and 
stature. If winning titles were that easy, other teams would have 
figured out a way, given the resources at their disposal. But 
excellence isn't achieved easily. It's built on culture, leadership, 
and many other factors. 
The Wankhede seemed alien as Mumbai came home this 
season to begin their home leg. As Rajasthan routed Mumbai, 
it seemed that the team wasn't what it used to be. While many 
have dissected the causes and shared their views, the whole 
leadership transition saga boils down to one big question: 
whether the mighty Mumbai have made a miscalculation. 
Nobody can tell for sure; only time will tell. However, the

dilemma contains interesting dynamics within 
itself that are worth pondering.
For the sake of brevity, let's eliminate as 
many stakeholders as possible. To begin with, 
Rohit is a legendary skipper. However, in any 
business, the big boss must move out when the 
time is right, and this case is no exception. The 
fans, another critical stakeholder in franchise 
dynamics, will come to terms with the change 
despite the apparent animosity at present. They 
will accept the transition the moment Pandya 
turns the tide and delivers, which he must do 
quickly. Moreover, Pandya is at the centre of 
this entire saga. One cannot fully understand 
Pandya's role in this equation without access to 
the minute details of the transaction.
While all those factors are left out for brevity, 
let us get to the single biggest dilemma 
Mumbai would be sweating over. 
Jasprit Jasbir Singh Bumrah!! 
In T20 cricket, it's beyond doubt that batters 
grab eyeballs, but it's the bowlers who win 
you tournaments. Bumrah has been doing 
this for India and Mumbai with a consistency 
that is almost unimaginable. He has agreed to 
be retained at every mega auction, which is 
noteworthy because no advanced algorithm 
can predict his value if he were to enter the 
free market. Bumrah's cryptic social media 
posts, occurring as many other fast bowlers 
were snatched up at prices driven by irrational 
auction dynamics, offer a glimpse into his 
thoughts on what was unfolding. 
Till now, Bumrah has remained loyal to 
the franchise despite knowing he could 
potentially shatter any imaginable ceiling if 
he refused retention and entered the auction. 
Unlike players like Starc and Cummins, who 
selectively participate, Bumrah has consistently 
carried the franchise and demonstrated 
exceptional results, establishing himself in 
a league of his own. Given his composed 
demeanour and his experience leading India in 
Tests, it's natural that Bumrah would harbour 
leadership aspirations for the post-Rohit

era. However, now that Mumbai has opted 
for Hardik over him for some reason and 
communicated in a manner suggesting that 
Bumrah's loyalty isn't worthy of leadership, it 
wouldn't be surprising to see him reconsider 
his loyalty and enter the free market. If he 
does, given Mumbai's reliance on big stars, 
it's hard to imagine how they could afford 
him at market price. Given his calibre and 
value, every franchise would vie for Bumrah, 
potentially delivering a significant jolt to the 
entire Mumbai Indians ecosystem. Regardless 
of who comes in or moves out, Mumbai 
cannot afford to lose Bumrah. Letting him go 
could have consequences more severe than the 
benefits of Hardik's return. 
However, what's intriguing is how a franchise 
known for its all-around excellence in both 
sport and business, like Mumbai, led by the 
best in the business, could be oblivious to the 
risks posed by the Hardik trade. Alternatively, 
if they are aware, how they plan to mitigate 
these risks remains a question. The answer 
isn't straightforward, but it is surely one worth 
watching out for. 
One might think that a single player cannot 
determine the fate of a team, but when a player 
like Bumrah—a once-in-many-generations 
phenomenon—is at risk, it can cause a seismic 
shift in the fate of any team, let alone Mumbai.
Interesting times lie ahead, and only time will 
reveal the true value of the Hardik Pandya 
trade, which could potentially determine 
whether Mumbai will replicate its past 
dominance or fade into mediocrity, joining the 
rest of the pack.
After all, leadership drives excellence and 
culture, and when a leadership transition is not 
handled correctly, it can erode these two key 
pillars of success.
