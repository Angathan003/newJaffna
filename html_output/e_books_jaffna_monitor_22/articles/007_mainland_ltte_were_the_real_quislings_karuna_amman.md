Mainland LTTE Were 
the Real Quislings: 
Karuna Amman 
Part-4
Who is the Traitor?
Did you anticipate that the Vanni Tigers 
would cross the Verugal River and launch 
an attack on the eastern LTTE fighters? 
After breaking away from the main faction of 
the LTTE, I wrote earnest letters to our leader, 
Prabhakaran, and sent them through the ICRC. 
In my letters, I appealed to him, 'The Eastern 
fighters have repeatedly saved the lives of you 
and your closest allies; hundreds from the East 
have embraced martyrdom in your defense, and 
around 5,000 of them fell in the northern battles. 
I have explained why these fighters should not be 
harmed. We seek no conflict,' I wrote, and I also 
mentioned that I am sending these fighters home 
to save them.
I subtly conveyed that the rift was a personal 
grievance between Prabhakaran and myself, 
underscoring that the Eastern fighters were 
innocent in this separation. Regrettably, under 
the influence of commanders like Pottu Amman, 
Prabhakaran made the grievous error of declaring 
war on the Eastern fighters.

Coming back to your question. Indeed, I was 
aware that the Vanni Tigers were advancing 
toward the Verugal bank, yet I had not foreseen 
an assault. The Vanni Tigers brokered a deal 
with the Sri Lankan Army—their lifelong 
adversaries—to orchestrate an attack on 
their own eastern fighters. The Vanni LTTE 
shipped the weapons by sea from Semmalai in 
Mullaitivu to Mutur in Trincomalee, aided by 
the Sri Lankan navy. As the weapons journeyed 
across the sea, between 700-800 Vanni LTTE 
fighters traveled by bus to the Trincomalee 
side of the Verugal River, navigating through 
numerous army checkpoints and areas under 
government control, clearly with the army's 
blessings.
In 
this 
scheme, 
the 
LTTE 
leadership 
collaborated closely with the Sri Lankan Army, 
effectively acting as a 'Quislings Group' or 
'Ottukkuzhu.' Ironically, they labelled us as the 
'Ottukkuzhu,' accusing us of colluding with 
the army when, in fact, their own actions were 
those of a true Quislings Group.
I do not blame the army; as our adversaries, 
they naturally preferred to see both factions of 
the LTTE weakened by internal conflict. 
I was fully cognizant of the unfolding events. 
Even the day before the Verugal attack, I visited 
the riverbank and engaged with the Vanni 
Tigers stationed across the river. I questioned 
them earnestly, "Why are you coming? Why 
must we engage in fratricidal fighting and die?" 
What subsequently occurred after 
your conversation with the Vanni 
Tigers?

A tragic event unfolded the very next day. They 
launched a sudden and brutal attack at midnight 
on the women's regiment stationed there, 
resulting in the senseless loss of approximately 
40 innocent female fighters. At that moment, 
I was actively engaged in sending my Eastern 
fighters back to their homes after having them 
lay down their weapons in a bid for peace.
While we were in the process of demobilizing, 
the Vanni LTTE forces crossed the river and 
mercilessly targeted the women fighters, 
catching us completely off guard. My intention 
was never to engage in further violence; the 
fratricidal killings that plagued our land 
following the departure of the Indian Peace 
Keeping Force (IPKF) from Sri Lankan soil 
had left a deep scar on my conscience. After 
the IPKF left, the LTTE's violent purges 
claimed the lives of about 8,000 Tamil youths 
from various militant factions, predominantly 
those associated with the Tamil National Army 
(TNA). 
Having witnessed and been a part of such 
horrors, I was determined to prevent any 
further bloodshed among our people. That 
resolve led me to ensure that my fighters were 
sent home safely after they had abandoned 
their arms.
The Eastern fighters and commanders 
stationed at the Verugal River told 
us that you should have given them 
instructions on how to conduct offence 
or defence when attacked...

 Actually, I did not give any instructions, and I 
also had not anticipated that they would attack 
us. I knew they came with weapons and in large 
numbers, but I never thought they would launch 
a military attack against us. I also informed the 
LTTE leadership that if they came to attack us, 
I would not order a retaliation; instead, I wrote 
that I would send my fighters back home.
When did you send your Eastern 
fighters home? After the Vanni Tigers 
launched their attack or before that?
I had begun sending my Eastern fighters home 
before the Vanni Tigers attacked us on April 
10, 2004. By the next day, April 11, I planned 
to send all fighters home, having already called 
a meeting with Eastern commanders like 
Jimkelly Thatha and Robert. The strategy was to 
send ordinary fighters home while keeping key 
commanders with me to take abroad, as they 
were under threat from the LTTE leadership.
Who led the invasion from the North 
to the East?
The invasion was meticulously planned. 
The primary force was the Charles Antony 
Regiment, led by Nagulan, who targeted us. 
Banu served as the overall commander of this 
operation. Eastern commander Ramesh was 
also involved with them. Nagulan, who is still 
alive, committed numerous atrocities in the 
Eastern region during this time.
Why did you not attack? Did your 
Eastern fighters have the ability to 
fight back against the Vanni LTTE?
We had the manpower and resources to retaliate 
against the Vanni Tigers. Had we launched an 
attack, it would have been a straightforward 
task. Under my command, 6,000 fighters were 
trained to follow my directives and those 
of my Eastern commanders. Our strength 
wasn't limited to manpower alone; we also had 
significant weaponry at our disposal. Among 
us were battle-hardened, experienced fighters 
and commanders who had participated 
in the Jeyasikkuru battle. Had I ordered a 
counterattack, they would have crushed the 
opposition in hours. We could have driven 
them all the way to Muthur.
However, I was firmly opposed to a fratricidal 
war. The commanders who led the attack 
against us, such as Banu and Nagulan from the 
Charles Antony Regiment, were not seasoned 
fighters. They were the type who might have 
fled had we struck back. We have seen these 
commanders' true valour and skill in the final 
battle (laughs).
Did every Eastern commander 
accept your decision to split with the 
mainland LTTE?
Before publicly announcing my decision, I 
convened a meeting with key commanders 
from the Eastern region. I shared my concerns 
that the ongoing conflict was stagnating and 
that the LTTE leadership was not genuinely 
committed to its peace negotiations with the 
Sri Lankan government. I warned them that 
Leader Prabhakaran would likely break the 
ceasefire soon and that hostilities would likely 
resume.
I further explained that he was not open to 
considering any solutions, including federalism 
or anything similar. I told my commanders 
that I was unwilling to lose more of my fighters 
and emphasized how the LTTE leadership had

failed to properly respect and represent Eastern 
fighters.
Furthermore, I declared that anyone who 
wished to remain with me was welcome, and 
those who preferred to stay with the LTTE 
leadership could go to Vanni.
Following 
this 
declaration, 
Eastern 
commanders like Ramesh, Karikalan, Prabha, 
and a few others chose to leave for Vanni. I 
allowed them to go peacefully; I did not stop 
or attack them, as I did not intend to engage in 
combat with the Vanni Tigers. 
What was your strategy at that time?
My primary objective was to safely send 
the fighters back to their homes. While my 
commanders voiced concerns about my 
personal security, I reassured them that I was 
capable of protecting myself. More importantly, 
I was committed to ensuring the safety of my 
commanders.
I requested they join me in Colombo, where 
I intended to negotiate with the Sri Lankan 
government. Recognizing the dangers they 
faced, my ultimate goal was to arrange for my 
commanders to go abroad, as they were likely 
to be prime targets for the LTTE leadership.
About 35 to 40 important Eastern commanders 
accompanied me to Colombo. However, during 
our stay, Pottu Amman and his associates 
contacted the commanders via phone. They 
spoke in soothing, persuasive tones, reminding 
them of the greater cause we all had once fought 
for. They implored, 'Why are you leaving us?' 
and assured them that leader Prabhakaran 
had granted them amnesty, inviting them to 
return freely to Batticaloa. Convinced by these 
reassurances, commanders, including Robert, 
Jimkelly Thatha, Visu Thurai, and a few others—
resulting in 18 key LTTE commanders—
decided to return to Batticaloa.
Tragically, upon their return, they were 
deceitfully arrested and met with gruesome 
fates. For example, Robert and Jimkelly Thatha 
were horrifically tied to a tree, doused with 
kerosene, and burned alive by Charles Antony 
Brigade Commander Nagulan—a right-hand 
man of Pottu Amman—who now resides in the 
Jaffna Neerveli area and has taken up farming 
after surrendering to the military in the last 
war.
How do you view these killings?
These killings represent the utmost betrayal. 
When I, Karuna Amman, decided to split, 
the LTTE leadership dismissed my actions, 
claiming that I was merely one individual and 
that the Eastern LTTE fighters were distinct 
from me. They also claimed that my departure 
would not impact their struggle.
However, the grim fate of those Eastern

commanders who surrendered to the Vanni 
Tigers, lured by their seemingly sincere 
promises, tells a different story. None were 
spared; each commander was mercilessly 
executed. Had those who surrendered survived, 
it might have suggested that my actions were 
traitorous, and even my own conscience would 
have tormented me. However, the brutal 
extermination of those who surrendered only 
affirmed my stance and clearly vindicated me.
Among those lost were highly regarded 
commanders of both genders, including Saali, 
Theentamil, Premini, Jimkalli Thatha, and 
Robert—heroes of the Jeyasikkuru battle. 
Other notable figures, such as the political 
leader Turai, Visu, and Nisam, also suffered 
tragic fates. Leader Prabhakaran directly 
ordered these actions.
They returned to the Vanni Tigers, deeply 
trusting leader Prabhakaran. There was no 
inherent animosity between them and the 
leadership, nor among the fighters from 
different regions. Loyalty would have prevailed 
until their end. However, the decision of the 
LTTE leadership to execute these individuals 
starkly illustrates the cruel mindset of the 
leadership.
There are still accusations that you 
abandoned your commanders and 
fighters and escaped. How do you 
respond to these claims?
Those accusations are unfounded. I prioritized 
the safety of my forces by sending the 
ordinary fighters back home, and I took my

key commanders with me to Colombo to 
ensure their protection. However, despite 
my warnings, they were persuaded to return 
to Batticaloa by the sweet-talking of Pottu 
Amman and his associates. I explicitly advised 
them against returning and cautioned them 
not to trust Pottu Amman. 
 A few journalists and writers suggest 
that you intentionally moved your 
regiments to Verugal to fight with the 
Vanni Tigers should they cross. How 
much truth is there in this?
This is absolutely nonsense and an absolute lie. 
There are many fighters still alive; you can ask 
them. I never instigated or gave commands to 
any Eastern fighters to attack the Vanni Tigers. 
I was very clear that another fratricidal murder 
should not happen again.
Why were those regiments stationed 
at the Verugal River?
Stationing regiments at the Verugal River is 
standard procedure. The forces deployed on the 
Batticaloa side of the Verugal River primarily 
hailed from the Vagarai region; it was their 
standard post. Additionally, a few regiments 
were temporarily stationed there for training 
purposes over several months. If my intention 
had been to engage the Vanni Tigers in 
combat, I could have easily deployed my main 
fighting forces to that location and effectively 
challenged the Vanni Tigers. However, that 
was not my objective; I did not wish to escalate 
the conflict.
Is it true that the female fighters from 
the Eastern region were sexually 
assaulted in the Verugal area by the 
invading Vanni Tigers?

Pottu Amman is his third son, Kallaikannan, who was killed in the war in mid-May 2009

Yes, I have been informed by the people of 
Kathiraveli about such incidents. They shared 
distressing accounts of witnessing these 
atrocities, which spurred the locals to confront 
the Vanni Tigers with broomsticks in their 
outrage. I am sure that it was the Vanni Tigers 
who attacked us and committed these heinous 
acts.
Do you believe the Vanni Tigers 
committed these acts?
Yes, I do believe so. They were deployed to 
the East without any restraint, behaving like 
wild animals. They were ordered to commit 
atrocities to crush the Eastern fighters, so it's 
very likely that they also perpetrated cruel acts 
against our female fighters.
Has this kind of behaviour occurred 
in the past, such as the LTTE sexually 
assaulting female fighters from other 
militant organizations?
No, never. In the past, any misconduct 
toward women was met with the severest 
of penalties, including the death sentence. 
Leader Prabhakaran and I were very strict on 
this matter. I believe this is the first time in 
the history of the LTTE that members have 
indulged in such cruel sexual violence against 
women, tragically against their own fighters.
There are claims that the burning 
incident was orchestrated by Ramesh, 
a former Eastern commander. How do 
you respond to this?
No, that claim is incorrect. It was Nagulan, 
not Ramesh, who orchestrated the burning. 
Although Ramesh is Robert's own cousin, his 
role was different. He spoke persuasively to the 
commanders, convincing them to return, and 
then handed them over to Nagulan. The actual 
act of burning these commanders to death 
was carried out by Nagulan at an LTTE base 
located in Panchimarathadi in the Thoppigala 
forest. Those involved in this heinous act are 
still alive, and it is possible to meet and speak 
with them about the incident.
There are opinions that you should 
have commemorated the Verugal 
massacre but chose not to. What is 
your response to this?
It is undeniable that the fighters who lost their 
lives at Verugal deserve to be remembered, 
and I fully acknowledge the importance of 
commemorating them. However, my hesitation 
stems from a desire to ensure that such 
remembrances do not foster division between 
the Eastern and Northern Tamils. I am very 
conscious of the potential for such events to 
instigate hatred between these communities, 
which would not be productive or beneficial.
The Vanni Tigers did not just strike at Verugal; 
they also killed almost 500 Eastern LTTE 
fighters in other parts of the East, and these 
fighters, too, should be honoured in the future, 
our party plans to commemorate all LTTE 
fighters, including those who died at Verugal.
Moreover, it's important to highlight that it 
was the Vanni Tigers, not us, who perpetrated 
the fratricidal violence in the East. They 
collaborated with the Sri Lankan army and 
navy, leveraging this alliance to attack us.
