K
arthikan was merely 6 years 
old when his father, Thurai, 
the former leader of the LTTE's 
political wing for the Batticaloa 
district, was summoned for an 
investigation by Keerthi, the newly 
appointed intelligence wing chief 
of Batticaloa and a right-hand man 
of Pottu Amman. At the time of the 
split, Thurai was said to have sided 
with Karuna Amman. Afterwards, 
it is said that Thurai disassociated 
from everything, was not involved 
with Karuna's faction, and did 
not take sides; he led a relatively 
peaceful life at his close relative's 
house. Here's our interview with 
Karthikan.
Do you remember your 
father?
I was only six years old when men 
from the LTTE came to take my 
father away. They arrived in a van 
and informed us that they were 
acting on orders from Keerthi 
Mama, the intelligence chief of the 
Batticaloa and Ampara districts. 
They took my father and Robert 
mama on April 20th, 2004. The 
person who came to take my father 
was named Yogarasa, a member of 
the LTTE's intelligence wing, who 
now resides abroad. That was the 
last time I saw my father. He never 
returned.
