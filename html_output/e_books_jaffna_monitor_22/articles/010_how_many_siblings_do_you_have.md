Keerthi Mama confirmed this tragic outcome 
to my mother several months after the event.
How many siblings do you have?
We are three siblings. At the time of my 
father's death, I was 6 years old—I am the only 
one who can recall memories of my father. 
My younger brother was 4 years old, and he 
has only faint memories of our father. My 
sister was just 1 year old then; she does not 
remember him at all.
Who ordered the execution?
According to my mother, it was ordered by 
Colonel Ramesh, the then-commander of the 
LTTE for the Batticaloa and Ampara districts, 
who was also a close relative of my father. 
After my father's death, one of the individuals 
present at the site where he was killed came 
to meet my mother. He apologized and told 
her that my father, along with other important 
LTTE commanders, was killed and buried 
in a large pit created by a backhoe. There are 
varying accounts of the event: 
some say he and the other 
commanders were shot dead 
and cremated, while others 
claim they were burned to 
death. 
How did your family 
manage to continue 
living after your father's 
tragic death?
It was months after his arrest 
that we learned of his death, 
leaving us in a state of painful 
uncertainty. My mother 
endured immense grief. Over time, she found 
strength and took a job at a hospital, which 
helped us slowly rebuild our lives and find a 
way forward through the sorrow.
Do you or your mother harbour 
any hatred towards those who 
killed your father or ordered his 
execution?
Absolutely not. The irony is 
painful—the very people who 
took my father from us were once 
close to him, almost like family. 
Every day, I grapple with a deep 
sadness, knowing he's gone, mixed 
with confusion over my feelings 
towards them. In my heart, I 
don't find hatred, only a profound 
sorrow. This entire ordeal has 
imprinted on me a crucial lesson: 
we must do everything in our 
power to prevent such heart-
wrenching, fratricidal violence 
in the future. We also should not 
allow the North to dictate what 
the Easterners should do.
