The Verugal Tragedy - 
Confronting Shadows 
from Our Past
Dear Esteemed Readers,
We extend our warmest wishes for the Tamil New Year. 
Regrettably, we must also convey our apologies for the 
tardiness of this fortnightly edition of the Jaffna Moni-
tor, initially slated for release on April 15th. This delay 
was necessitated by the New Year's leave granted to our 
dedicated staff—a well-earned respite, though it has 
postponed our schedule.
In this issue, we delve into a narrative that, despite 
its relative obscurity, persistently echoes in the hearts 
of those who experienced it firsthand—the Verugal 
massacre. This somber chapter unfolded two decades 
ago, characterized by fratricidal strife that saw Tamils 
in tragic conflict with their own kin. Recounting these 
events transcends mere historical records; it acts as a 
potent cautionary tale against the repetition of such 
harrowing conflicts.
Upholding our dedication to journalistic excellence, 
our inquiry took us to the eastern locales of Verugal 
and Kathiraveli. Here, the very atmosphere is laden 
with the resonant legacies of anguish. Our correspond-
ents engaged in comprehensive dialogues with former 
Eastern LTTE combatants, survivors, and pivotal 
figures such as Karuna Amman, the erstwhile Eastern 
LTTE wing chief; Pillayan (Sivanesathurai Chandra-
kanthan), currently the State Minister for Rural Road 
Development of Sri Lanka; Jeyam, former commander 
of the Visalakan Brigade; and Savithiri, erstwhile 
leader of the Mathana Regiment. These discussions 
enriched our portrayal of this deep-seated internecine 
conflict, infusing our understanding with complexity 
and insight.
The massacre, executed by the Northern faction of the 
LTTE against their Eastern counterparts, remains em-
blematic of the internecine violence that has indelibly 
scarred our collective history. We, as journalists born 
in Jaffna, embrace an intrinsic obligation to illuminate 
such neglected horrors. The revelation of these truths 
is indispensable, serving not only as a mechanism for 
communal healing and understanding but also as a 
safeguard against the recurrence of such atrocities.
We are acutely aware that by elevating this discussion, 
we might alienate adherents of the mainland LTTE 
and devotees of Prabhakaran. Nonetheless, our edito-
rial stance is resolute: fidelity to truth supersedes par-
tisanship. The journey toward reconciliation and unity 
is paved through the rigorous examination of our past, 
no matter the discomfort it may bring.
As you peruse this edition, we invite you to ponder the 
critical role of remembrance and truth in shaping a 
future distinguished by peace and mutual understand-
ing. By memorializing the victims of the Verugal mas-
sacre and acknowledging our common humanity, we 
affirm that no conflict should ever sever these bonds.
We are grateful for your ongoing support and patience 
as we navigate these imperative, albeit challenging, 
narratives. It is only by confronting our history with 
openness and resolve that we can aspire to cultivate a 
resilient and unified society.
Warm regards,
