To the Editor of the Jaffna Monitor,
I am writing in response to your recent article regarding the tragic incident 
involving acupuncture in Jaffna. As an advocate for both responsible journalism 
and comprehensive healthcare, I feel compelled to address certain aspects of your 
coverage.
Firstly, it is crucial for the Jaffna Monitor, as a leading voice in Sri Lanka's Tamil 
regions, to uphold the principle of journalistic neutrality. Given its significant 
influence on public perception as the only English magazine from the Tamil-speaking 
areas of Sri Lanka, the handling of sensitive topics is vital. While the incident in 
question is undoubtedly tragic, it should not be used to cast an unwarranted shadow 
over the entire practice of acupuncture or alternative medicine. It is important to 
differentiate between an isolated case of malpractice and the broader field of medicine. 
Acupuncture, deeply rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, is a globally recognized 
and respected medical practice. When administered by licensed and trained 
professionals, its efficacy and safety are well-documented and acknowledged 
worldwide, including in countries such as the United States, Germany, Canada, and 
South Korea. The unfortunate incident in Jaffna seems to stem more from a lack of 
regulation and practitioner error rather than an inherent flaw in acupuncture itself.
Medical malpractice unfortunately exists across various medical disciplines, including

modern allopathic practices. Maintaining a balanced perspective is crucial; 
focusing solely on incidents within alternative medicine is not conducive 
to this. The reporting style in your last issue, particularly regarding the 
acupuncture-related mistreatment and subsequent death, unfairly casts 
acupuncture in a negative light, suggesting it's invalid or harmful. This is 
not an accurate representation. Recognizing the significant role of allopathic 
medicine in contemporary healthcare is essential, but acknowledging the 
value of other medical traditions is equally important. Numerous instances 
have demonstrated how Ayurvedic therapies effectively resolved illnesses 
that other methods could not. Additionally, I am concerned about the stance 
of the medical establishment, especially organizations like the Government 
Medical Officers' Association (GMOA). Their apparent emphasis on 
suppressing non-allopathic practices is worrying. It appears there is a 
systematic effort by these entities to target and unjustly discredit alternative 
medical practices. 
If your approach were truly neutral, you would equally highlight instances 
of negligence in modern medicine, such as the reported case where a young 
girl tragically lost her arm due to medical malpractice at the Jaffna Teaching 
Hospital a few months ago. Those responsible for this case, including doctors 
and nursing staff, are still at large. Why not report on that as well?
The need of the hour is for strict regulatory oversight across all medical 
practices and heightened public awareness about the qualifications of 
healthcare providers, regardless of the field. The media can play a crucial 
role in this regard, advocating for policies and systems that safeguard public 
health while providing balanced and factual information.
While it is essential to report on public health issues and incidents of 
medical negligence, it is equally important to do so in a way that informs, 
educates, and maintains an unbiased stance. The approach should be one of 
constructive dialogue and advocacy for better healthcare standards rather 
than inadvertently stigmatizing a particular branch of medicine.
I trust that the Jaffna Monitor will consider these perspectives in future 
reporting, continuing to serve as a vital source of information and a bastion 
of responsible journalism.
Sincerely,
M.Ilangumaran
