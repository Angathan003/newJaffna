Despite LTTE Leadership's 
Intent to Destroy Us, We 
Are Still Rising:   
Interview with Pillayan
We met with Sivanesathurai 
Chandrakanthan, also known as Pillayan, 
the leader of the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai 
Pulikal (TMVP) and the State Minister 
for Rural Road Development of Sri Lanka. 
His party, TMVP, is at the forefront of 
commemorating the Verugal massacre 
annually. Below are excerpts from our 
interview with him.
Why do you commemorate the 
Verugal massacre every year?  
It has been 20 years since the Verugal 
massacres took place. It is important for us 
to reflect on the suffering and sorrow we 
endured when fleeing Verugal. The invasion 
by the Vanni Tigers, under orders from 
LTTE leader Prabhakaran and Intelligence 
Wing Chief Pottu Amman, forever changed

our lives and the political landscape of the 
East.
LTTE leadership, Those who once claimed we 
were of the same race, declared the Northeast 
united and called us brothers and sisters, 
ultimately betrayed and killed us. The pain and 
agony of the Verugal massacre, along with the 
momentum it spurred, have shaped us into 
who we are today. 
Although the LTTE leadership intended to 
destroy us, we are still rising, even 20 years 
later. We remember the Verugal massacre as 
an event that recalls the pain and suffering of 
the Eastern fighters and honors those Eastern 
Tigers who were unjustly killed by the LTTE 
leadership.
Additionally, this commemoration 
demonstrates that we have overcome the 
dominance of the Northern Jaffna mindset and 
have established the distinct identity of the 
East.
What do you mean by the dominance 
of the Northern Jaffna mindset? 
I don't blame everyone, but the LTTE 
leadership had a Jaffna-centric superiority 
mindset, believing they alone possessed all 
knowledge. The Eastern Province cooperated 
with the Northern LTTE, participating 
diligently in the liberation struggle. However, 
the Northern leadership believed that the 
Eastern fighters and people should only listen 
to their directives.
Most people from the North went abroad, 
leaving us, the Eastern fighters, to keep the 
liberation struggle alive. I joined the fight in 
Vanni in 1993. Like me, thousands from the 
East traveled north to partake in the struggle. 
We campaigned at every intersection in 
Kilinochchi, calling out to the youth, 'The 
enemy has entered our territory, he waits to 
desecrate our land, so come, join us, let us 
fight together.' Yet, many Northern youths did 
not heed the call; instead, they paid agencies 
to take them abroad. As a result, thousands 
of Eastern youths were compelled to go north 
and take up arms. 
At the Theravil Thuyilum Illam in Kilinochchi, 
a martyrs' resting place, most of those who lie 
buried are fighters from the Eastern Province. 
About 5,000 Eastern provincial fighters have 
died in the North. Was the LTTE leadership's 
treatment of us, who left our Eastern homes 
to fight in the North, justifiable? Was it 
acceptable? Was it moral?
The political approach led by Karuna 
Amman differs from yours. However, 
in 2004, Karuna Amman decided 
that the Eastern Tigers should 
separate from the Northern Tigers 
and operate independently. Was this 
the right decision?
Before Karuna Amman decided to split from 
the main LTTE, He discussed the separation 
with us. I expressed my view that preserving 
the aspirations of the Eastern Province was 
essential. I acknowledged his concerns but 
emphasized the numerous sacrifices we, 
eastern fighters, had made for the freedom 
struggle and ethnic liberation. I cautioned him 
that if news of this Eastern split were to leak to 
the media, it could be strategically used against 
us by the enemy, potentially jeopardizing our 
quest for ethnic liberation. Therefore, I advised 
that we must strategically secure what is 
necessary for the Eastern Province.

Although Karuna Amman decided to initiate 
a split, he was not inclined to engage in 
conflict with the LTTE leadership or the 
Northern fighters. He believed that LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran would send a delegation 
to negotiate, hoping they could eventually 
reach an agreement. It is my understanding 
that Karuna Amman did not anticipate 
Prabhakaran's decision to order an invasion of 
the East and target Eastern fighters.
 If Karuna Amman had firmly stood by his 
decision, we could have made significant 
changes in the Eastern Province over these 
20 years. It is also his fault for not working 
tirelessly for the decision he made.
 However, his decision to separate from the 
mainland LTTE is why the Eastern Province 
operates independently today. Additionally, his 
decision saved thousands of eastern provincial 
fighters. Otherwise, at least another 10,000 
eastern fighters would have gone to the North 
and died. The struggle would have dragged on. 
In my opinion, if liberation movements are 
to achieve their stated dreams, they must 
fight and secure these goals within a specified 
period. Similarly, military victories must be 
converted into political successes. These two 
crucial aspects were absent in the leadership 
of the Tigers. Therefore, Karuna Amman's 
decision to split from the mainland LTTE was 
correct.
What types of human rights 
violations occurred against Eastern 
fighters in Verugal?
On the morning of April 10th, a tragic and 
brutal attack was carried out by the Vanni 
Tigers, who invaded Verugal and executed 
a calculated assault on Eastern fighters. The 
aggressors surrounded the area, leading to the 
merciless killing of numerous Eastern fighters. 
In a particularly egregious violation of human 
dignity, the bodies of the deceased were 
left unburied for many days. Furthermore,

the Kathiraveli villagers, who attempted to 
cremate the bodies, were forcefully sent out 
at gunpoint, compounding the atrocity with a 
denial of basic funeral rites.
Further atrocities included the neglect of 
wounded fighters, whose untreated injuries led 
to death from infection. Reports also surfaced 
of female combatants being subjected to severe 
humiliation and physical torture; they were 
forcibly disrobed and compelled to stand on 
scorching sand by the Vanni Male Tigers.
Additionally, in a chilling betrayal, 18 key 
commanders, including figures known as 
Jimkelly Thatha and Robert, were deceitfully 
summoned under the pretense of a call from 
leader Prabhakaran. This ruse led to their 
brutal murder; they were shot, and their 
bodies callously burned.
Why is there a refusal in the 
North to acknowledge the Verugal 
massacres, with some even 
denying that such a massacre ever 
occurred?
During the times of conflict, numerous 
massacres took place. We remember and 
commemorate the massacres perpetrated 
by the Sri Lankan and Indian armies, such 
as the July 1983 riots, the Kumudini boat 
massacre, and the Sathurukondan massacre, 
among others. However, we often overlook the 
Verugal massacre, a tragic event where Tamils 
killed fellow Tamils.
Most notably, much of the Tamil media 
behaves as if this massacre never happened. 
How profoundly unjust is this? Approximately 
500 Eastern fighters were slain by the Vanni 
Tigers during the Eastern split, yet no one 
questions this. No media outlet reports on it. 
The media maintains a deceitful silence.
We organize this remembrance every year 
so that future generations will be informed 
about this massacre. Only then will they truly 
understand what actually happened, ensuring 
that they never repeat these fratricidal 
murders.
