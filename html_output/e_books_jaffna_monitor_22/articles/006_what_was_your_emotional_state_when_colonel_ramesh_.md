What was your emotional state 
when Colonel Ramesh, who 
was implicated in the Verugal 
massacres, surrendered to the 
military and was killed?
It was extremely distressing to witness 
Colonel Ramesh being brutally tortured 
by the military. I know he was one of 
those who orchestrated the killings 
in Verugal and across the East, but it 
was profoundly difficult for me to see 
someone I regarded as an elder brother 
subjected to such inhumane treatment.
Is it true that Colonel Ramesh 
issued the orders to shoot 
and burn key eastern commanders 
who surrendered to the Vanni 
Tigers, including figures like Jimkali 
Thatha, Thirumal, Robert, and 15 
other prominent commanders at 
Panchimarathadi?
Yes, he did issue those orders. I perceived it as 
Ramesh Annan facing the consequences of his 
actions. Despite this, I felt neither anger nor 
sorrow towards him; he was someone I had 
known as a brother.
But, Colonel Ramesh alone could not 
have made the decision to execute 
and burn the key commanders. The 
LTTE's structure wouldn't allow him 
to make such profound decisions 
alone, could it?
Definitely not. Such an order had to come from 
higher up in the hierarchy.
Who ordered that execution?
Given the structure of the LTTE, such a 
significant decision would have had to come 
from the top leadership. It was ordered by the 
leader, Prabhakaran, and passed through the 
intelligence wing's chief, Pottu Amman.
Do you agree with Karuna Amman's 
assertion that the Vanni leadership 
neglected the eastern fighters by not 
providing the necessary resources 
and recognition?
Yes, it is true. The eastern fighters were neglected 
by the LTTE leadership. Additionally, whenever 
we achieved victories in Vanni after sacrificing 
our lives, those victories were often claimed 
by the northern commanders, who were then 
given the honour of raising the flag.
