The Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) 
has sounded the alarm on a significant public 
health threat in Sri Lanka. In its latest research 
findings, the CEJ reveals the disturbing 
presence of Endocrine Disruptive Chemicals 
(EDCs) in common consumer products, 
including water-repellent textiles and personal 
care items.
One of the most concerning findings pertains 
to the detection of perfluorooctanoic acid 
(PFDA), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, in 
water-repellent clothing sold in Sri Lanka. 
In tests conducted at Charles University in 
the Czech Republic, an apron and a jacket 
purchased locally were found to contain PFDA 
levels of 2.6 and 2.7 parts per billion (ppb) 
respectively.
The inquiry didn't stop at textiles. At the 
Wonjin Institute of Environmental and 
Occupational Health, a variety of personal

care products were examined for nine types of 
parabens and triclosan, all identified as EDCs. 
Out of the 30 samples tested, six contained 
three types of parabens - methylparaben 
(ranging from 0.07 to 2823.2 μg/g), 
propylparaben (ranging from 0.03 to 14.20 
μg/g), and butylparaben (measuring 75.07 
μg/g).
Highlighting the severity of this issue, the 
CEJ urged local authorities to adopt strategies 
similar to those of global brands. These 
companies have taken proactive steps by 
announcing a ban on per-and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) in their products.
The CEJ advocates for a comprehensive ban on 
all PFAS, as opposed to selective restrictions. 
This call for action is driven by the potential 
health risks these chemicals pose, as they 
have been linked to various health problems 
including hormonal disruptions and increased 
cancer risk.
A worrying trend identified in the study is the 
lack of transparency in product labelling. The 
research highlighted cases where products 
falsely claimed to be "paraben-free," with 
one out of six samples tested found to be 
incorrectly labelled.
In light of these findings, the CEJ is calling 
for stronger regulatory frameworks and 
enforcement to ensure consumer safety. This 
includes improved labelling laws to enhance 
transparency and allow consumers to make 
informed choices.
The Sri Lankan government and relevant 
authorities are yet to respond to these findings. 
However, the urgency for regulatory action 
is clear, with public health at stake. The CEJ's 
report serves as a call to action, not only for 
policymakers but also for consumers, to be 
more vigilant about the products they use 
daily.

Everyone refers to me as the only child of 
farmer Siṉṉappu. It is my great regret to have 
been born without siblings. But I do have a 
sibling in a way. She is Maṅgaiyarkkarasi. 
Whenever she calls out to me, 
‘Sathāsivaththaṇṇaṉ,’ it makes me so happy. 
She is not a sibling who was born of the 
same parents – but I adore her to death. She 
is just as fond of me. When I work the well 
to irrigate the tobacco plants during tobacco 
season, she would not sit still even if āchchi 
is delayed in sending me food. She would say, 
“Poor aṇṇaṉ, he is toiling in this heat,” and 
sit down to help āchchi to make sure that my 
food gets sent. Earlier, when she was studying 
at Ramanathan College, she would buy me 
M.G.R photos in different new poses and 
books with film song lyrics, because she knew 
I liked them.
She, too, was an only child. Her father was the 
head teacher in our village school. We all call 
him the head teacher. Elders like our parents 
refer to him as ‘Thiruneeṟṟuch chaṭṭampiyār.’ 
Always in a white vēṭṭi and a ‘national’ shirt, 
I often see him walking down the road to his 
school. When I see the three thick bands of 
thiruneeṟu on his forehead with a big circular 
sandalwood poṭṭu in the middle, and the little 
bobbing topknot on the back of his head, I am 
overcome with a devotion, nay, fear as though 
I want to bring my hands together to worship 
him. If he happened to see me on the way, 
his eyes would widen, and he would ask with

a slight smile, “How are you Sathāsivam?” 
A chill would come over me and my hair 
would bristle. Maṅgaiyarkkarasi is the darling 
daughter of such a personality. As much as his 
presence invoked a mixture of fear and joy in 
me, I could never tire of looking at her with 
fondness. When she talks to me, her chatter 
peppered with ‘Sathāsivaththaṇṇaṉ’ in every 
other sentence, I would even forget hunger. 
She would tell me so many stories and regale 
me with stories of movies featuring M.G.R 
and Sivaji.
Their new concrete house was just a couple 
of doors from ours. But she spent much of her 
time at our house. During the school holidays, 
she spent all her time at our house, going 
to hers only to sleep. If āchchi was unwell, 
she would take over the cooking duties. 
Otherwise, she would busy herself with 
helping āchchi with her chores. She wouldn’t 
care if some food was old or new, good or 
pleasant, even if āchchi protested “You aren’t 
used to this, child,” she would insist on tasting 
it. If there was some occasion for celebration 
in our house, she would be running it from 
the front, chatting jovially with everyone, 
joking without any inhibition. Countless

are the times when I heard someone say, 
“Thiruneeṟṟuch chaṭṭampiyār’s daughter is a 
good kid.” It made me really really happy. My 
chest would brim with pride, thinking, ‘She is 
my thaṅgachchi!’
If there was a celebration in their family, 
she would insist that I go to their house. She 
knew that I would refuse. I couldn’t bear to 
be in the proximity of thiruneeṟṟu vāththiār. 
Sometimes I wonder how Maṅgaiyarkkarasi 
tolerated being in his presence. I would ask 
her what right an illiterate farmer wearing 
a dirty vēṭṭi have to stand next to the god. 
She would say, “Aiyā loves to see you. You 
are scared for no reason.” Listening to her 
pleading, I would tear up. But I would be at a 
loss to figure out how on earth I could mingle 
with the god-like vāththiār or the other white-
vēṭṭi-clad men who would be visiting their 
house. “I can’t, thaṅgachchi, let me be,” I 
would beg her in a halting voice. “OK, aṇṇā,” 
she would give up and walk away. I would 
hide in a corner and cry my heart out until the 
heavy burden in my chest melts away.
I went to school only till the third grade. 
When I was in third grade, Maṅgaiyarkkarasi 
was in kindergarten. I was still in third grade 
as she progressed through first and second 
grades. After that I stopped going to school. 
I no longer wanted to go to school. Appu 
beat me, telling me to go to school. But I 
didn’t. Even Maṅgaiyarkkarasi asked me to 
go to school with her. I didn’t. Even the head 
teacher spoke to me one day, “Why don’t you 
come back to school? You would need to have 
a basic education to succeed in life.” I stood 
mum. Even in those days, I did not open my 
mouth in his presence. That day, I came home 
and wept. I didn’t cry when my own Appu 
beat me, telling me to go back to school. But 
when the head teacher asked me to come back 
to school, I could not control myself. I cried 
my heart out. Āchchi asked me why I was 
crying. I didn’t respond. I just cried.
I could never understand what they learned in 
grades nine and ten. Our Maṅgaiyarkkarasi 
went to Kandy to study in thirteenth or 
fourteenth grade! I once asked her, “What 
do you study in Kandy?” “You wouldn’t 
understand all that aṇṇā,” she said flatly. It 
is true that I couldn’t understand all that. I 
do read Tamil newspapers like Vīrakēsari, 
Thiṉakaran, and īḻanādu haltingly, letter by 
letter. I can even read the M.G.R. film song 
lyric books. Maṅgaiyarkkarasi reads big story 
books. I would love to read big books like 
that, too. But then how could I, who only went 
to third grade, read books that someone like 
Maṅgaiyarkkarasi who went to thirteenth or 
fourteenth grade reads. I don’t have the time 
to read anyway. So, I never figured out what 
they learn in grades thirteen or fourteen.”
For a while, I thought they learn English in 
higher classes.  But if I could learn to read in 
Tamil by the time I reached the third grade, 
then I guess it is enough to study till the sixth 
grade to be able to read in English. Why 
then are there grades beyond that? Why did 
Maṅgaiyarkkarasi go to Kandy to learn.
Once when she was home on vacation, she 
got a letter in English. I took the letter from 
the postman and handed it to her. It was filled 
with squiggly English writing. It looked 
just like the prescription that the apothecary 
scribbles in English when I have a running 
fever. I was thrilled that my thaṅgachchi, too, 
got a letter in English. I couldn’t help grinning 
as I took the letter to her. She had heard the 
postman’s bicycle bell and had come out of 
the house. “Why are you grinning, aṇṇā?” she 
asked as she took the letter from me. I wanted 
to see her read in English. So, I asked, ‘What 
does the letter say?’
She curled her lips; “I don’t understand 
English aṇṇā,” she said.

I was totally disappointed. “What did all that 
big education get you then?” I hissed. She 
laughed. I couldn’t control my tears. I covered 
my face and ran into the house to sit in a 
corner and cry.
I didn’t notice that she had followed me 
inside. She asked, “Why are you crying, 
aṇṇā?” She wiped my tears, saying that I was 
a big baby. “You are acting like a little kid,” 
she mocked me.
I asked, “What are you learning at the 
university in Kandy, if you are not learning 
English?” University is the school she goes 
to in Kandy. “You won’t understand all that 
aṇṇā”, she said. “Why should we learn the 
language of the white man now that he has 
left our country?” she asked. “We can do 
everything in our country using Tamil and 
Sinhala,” she said.
I didn’t really understand everything she said, 
I understood only a little. Why should we care 
about the white men’s language after they 
have left. We do, after all, write big books 
in Tamil. So why couldn’t we write little 
letters in Tamil as well? I didn’t think of all 
this with my third-grade education. It is my 
thaṅgachchi who is studying in the thirteenth 
or fourteenth grade who came up with these 
ideas. When I think about it, what she said 
makes sense. Perhaps this is what they learn 
in thirteenth and fourteenth grades.
Apparently, a white man had visited our own 
fields. Back when the railroad was being laid 
here, a white man who came to supervise the 
work had entered our field to help himself to 
some long beans. My āchchi, who was then a 
young woman, had demanded that the white 
man pay for the long beans he took. He paid 
her one rupee and had asked her something in 
English. Āchchi had blushed and ran into the 
house. Back then, it seemed that one rupee 
could buy as much as ten measures of rice. 
Now that such white men have already left, 
why do we need English, indeed!
One evening, as dusk was settling in, as I was 
going to irrigate the fields, carrying a spade, I 
noticed two pants-clad young men on bicycles 
hanging around our house. My thaṅgachchi 
was washing clothes at their well. I was 
incensed: why do these rascals want to ogle 
at my sister? I walked towards them. One 
of them said to the other, “Look your bird 
is here.” The other looked at the well and 
smiled. For a moment, it looked like my 
thaṅgachchi smiled back at them. How dare 
they! I glared at the men on bicycles. I was 
holding a spade. Perhaps that scared them. 
They took off like bullets and disappeared. 
Had they stayed, who knows, I might have 
had reason to use the spade.
That night, the moon was full. I loved to 
irrigate the fields on full moon nights, 
drawing water from the well while belting 
out M.G.R. movie songs. But that night, I 
was dejected. Did Maṅgaiyarkkarasi smile 
at those men? It looked like that. But it was 
dusk. Perhaps she just lifted her head, and I 
might have misinterpreted it as a smile. She 
wouldn’t have smiled at strange men. She is 
thiruneeṟṟuch chaṭṭampiyār’s daughter, my 
thaṅgachchi. These thoughts rushed through 
my mind. I felt a lump in my throat, and an 
irresistible urge to cry.
It was just four or five days ago that she got 
her results. It seems she has passed her exams. 
Now she is some V.A. or B.A. it seems. 
She came running to our house, hopping 
and skipping all the way, and asked āchchi, 
“Where is ‘Sathāsivaththaṇṇaṉ?” “Why?” I 
demanded. “Aṇṇai, I have passed the exam. 
I’m going to give you a gift,” she said. I was 
thrilled that my thaṅgachchi passed the exam. 
She held out a parcel in her hand but teased 
me by pulling her hand back when I reached 
out to take it. I leapt towards her, grabbed the

parcel, and opened it.
I was elated. She is truly my thaṅgachchi. I 
wanted to scoop her up and hug her tightly. 
But she ran away to āchchi, saying “Aṇṇan is 
still a baby.”
Her gift was a blue terylene shirt. Earlier, 
before she went off to university, she gave me 
a yellow terylene shirt. That was the only shirt 
I had all these days. I don’t usually wear a 
shirt, except sometimes when I go to the city, 
riding doubles on bicycles with other field 
hands to see the late-night show of an M.G.R 
fight movie.
Sometimes when thaṅgachchi was home on 
vacation from the university, I went to the 
movies with her. Even if I tried to wriggle out 
of it, she wouldn’t give up. “How can I go 
alone to see the movie, aṇṇā? I need a male 
relative to chaperone me. You come with 
me, I will take care of everything else,” she 
would say. What could I do? I would clean 
my yellow terylene shirt and outdoor vēṭṭi, put 
them on and take the bus with her to go see 
the movie. Otherwise, I don’t take the bus to 
go anywhere, even to the market.
She knew her way around Jaffna. She would 
insist that I buy a one-rupee-and-ten-cent 
ticket. I would flatly refuse. I would buy a

sixty-five-cent ticket to sit in the gallery. 
Occasionally I would turn around to scan 
the second-class seats at the back. The last 
time we went a movie together, a young man 
seemed to be eyeing thaṅgachchi. He looked 
familiar, but I couldn’t place him. People 
in the city were like that – men and women 
ogling at one another equally.
When the movie ended, a couple of girls 
called after thaṅgachchi, “Maṅgaiyarkkarasi, 
Maṅgaiyarkkarasi , Maṅgaiyarkkarasi!” 
Thaṅgachchi introduced me to them, saying, 
“This is the ‘Sathāsivaththaṇṇaṉ I told you 
all about.” I was both happy and shy. The girl 
wearing the yellow sari looked like a good 
girl; the one with the blue sari was so-so. 
But the one in the short skirt… chee…I was 
disgusted to even look at her. Her lips were 
painted red. She laughed, saying “It looks like 
he came, too.” Thaṅgachchi laughed, too. I 
didn’t understand anything, but I didn’t like 
what was going on anyway.
Later, I told thaṅgachchi not to be friends 
with the short-skirt girl. “The yellow sari girl 
seems to be the good sort. Be friends with 
her,” I said. Somehow, I seemed to have taken 
a liking to this yellow-sari girl. She was the 
right sort.
Sometimes, young men on bicycles came to 
visit thaṅgachchi. She would hang out with 
them, laughing and joking. She would invite 
them into her home and serve them tea. The 
head teacher didn’t seem to mind all this!
“You are a girl. You shouldn’t hang out with 
young men,” I admonished her. She laughed 
out loud. “Aṇṇai, you are still a baby. What 
is wrong with men and women being friends, 
talking and laughing? Whether that is wrong 
or not depends on one’s mind,” she said. I 
thought about it later. There is indeed nothing 
wrong with men and women being friends. 
Now I understand what they learned in the 
thirteenth grade.
Yesterday, when I returned home from the 
fields in the evening, thaṅgachchi looked as if 
she was going to cry. As soon as she saw me, 
she started to weep. I couldn’t bear to see her 
cry, she who is always laughing and joking. 
I felt like crying too. Usually, when I cried, 
she would tease me asking, “Are you still a 
baby?” I realized that something bad must 
have happened to make her so sad. I wiped 
her tears, held her hands and begged her to 
tell me why she was crying. She sobbed, 
saying, “Aiyā wants to marry me off.”
I did not understand. A marriage is a happy 
occasion. I couldn’t comprehend why she was 
crying about the prospect of marriage. “Isn’t 
that a good thing? Why are you crying?” I 
asked.
She stopped crying and glared at me. 
“Suppramaṇiam, who teaches at our big 
school, is the groom,” she said.
I know him. Boys at the big school tell me 
that he is one of the good teachers; I see 
him from time to time riding his bicycle. 
Sometimes he would be softly singing 
devotional hymns as he pedals. Sometimes he 
carries big English books. Once he dropped 
a book while he was riding his bicycle. I 
was the one who picked it up for him. Like 
thaṅgachchi, he is also a BA or MA or 
something. He is indeed a good match for 
Maṅgaiyarkkarasi. Why does she cry?
“He is a good man. A good match for you. 
Why are you crying, you silly girl? I asked.
She took out a photo from her blouse and 
thrust it towards me: A tall man wearing 
long pants and a woman. I wiped my eyes 
and looked again carefully. The woman in 
the photo was thaṅgachchi indeed! The pair 
were smiling as they posed for the photo. The

55
man looked familiar. Oh! It was the boy on a 
bicycle, ogling at thaṅgachchi. He was also 
the boy who was looking at her in the movie 
theater. My head was spinning. I felt faint, a 
lump in my chest, and my eyes clouded over. 
I felt like crying.
I suppressed the urge to cry. I looked into 
her eyes and demanded, “Are you really my 
thaṅgachchi?”
She fell at my feet and wept. “If not me, who 
is your sister?” she demanded. “Aiyā asked 
me, ‘Are you my daughter?’” she wailed. 
“Aṇṇai, I thought you are innocent like a 
baby. You, too, want to desert me?” she asked. 
I couldn’t control the urge to cry. “Why then 
did you do this, thaṅgachchi?” I asked.
She wiped her eyes and said “Why, aṇṇā? 
I don’t know why. I liked him, and he liked 
me. The responsibility of the parents stops 
when they marry their children off. But we are 
the ones who have to raise a family together. 
Don’t we have the wisdom to choose the 
person with whom we can raise a family? 
Aṇṇā, one should live with the person one 
loves. Aiyā says I must marry the one he 
chose. But I cannot live without him,” her 
eyes glistened as she pointed to the photo. I 
tried my best to steel myself but failed. My 
eyes were on the verge of crying, too. What 
she said seemed reasonable. I now understand 
what they learn in thirteenth and fourteenth 
grades. Those of us who stopped going to 
school after the third or fourth grade didn’t 
think up such novel notions. Only those who 
studied a lot can. If everyone gets to marry the 
person they love, … what a wonderful idea.”
Thaṅgachchi asked me to help her. The young 
man was apparently from the next village. She 
wanted me to take a note to him and bring 
him to her.
I agreed. I am not afraid of the dark. I am 
used to irrigating the fields even on moonless 
nights just based on muscle memory. But it 
was the thought of thiruneeṟṟu vāththiār that 
made me fret.
Well. He did arrive. I was the one who sent 
him and thaṅgachchi off on their way. After 
all, they are educated. I thought they would go 
somewhere to lead happy lives together.
Before they left, thaṅgachchi fell at my feet. 
“Aṇṇā, you are a god,” she said, “please bless 
us aṇṇā.” I was overcome with embarrassment 
and joy at the same time. Tears formed. 
“Thaṅgachchi, wherever you end up, live 
happily,” I said in a plaintive voice.
They walked into the darkness of the night. 
I was really happy to see thaṅgachchi’s joy. 
At the same time, the thought of thiruneeṟṟu 
vāththiār struck fear in my heart.
As she left, thaṅgachchi said, “Aṇṇā! Don’t 
worry about aiyā; people have to change with 
the times; aiyā will, too. I think his anger will 
subside with time.”
They left in tears. Why do they cry when 
they are so happy? They waved, and I stood 
waving. I stopped only when my arm was sore 
from all the waving. But my heart was warm.
I am no longer afraid of thiruneeṟṟu vāththiār. 
If he confronts me about thaṅgachchi eloping 
with the young man, I will have the guts to 
stand my ground and defend her. Really, I 
will.
I could not sleep a wink all night. I kept 
twisting and turning. The rooster crowed. 
Birds tweeted. Dawn arrived in tiptoes. As 
darkness departed, light arrived.
I thought, ‘Now, thaṅgachchi would be 
walking into the light.’
