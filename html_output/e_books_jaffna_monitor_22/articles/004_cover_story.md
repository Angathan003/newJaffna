The Verugal River, drawing its lifeblood 
from the verdant highlands and enriched by 
the waters of the mighty Mahaweli Ganga, 
gracefully snakes its way to the Indian Ocean 
along Sri Lanka's eastern coast. More than 
just a waterway, this river serves as a vital 
artery for the Eastern Province, nurturing 
the communities that flourish along its banks 
with sustenance and economic opportunities. 
Beyond its role as a lifeline, the Verugal River 
whispers tales of ancient mariners—the storied 
Alexandrian seafarers knew it as the Barraces, 
a testament to its prominence on the maps of 
the legendary cartographer Ptolemy in the 2nd 
century CE.
The river also stands as a silent witness to 
contemporary history, reflecting the turbulent 
events of the Verugal massacre that have 
shaped the quest for Tamil liberation in Sri 
Lanka. Two decades ago, this serene riverbank 
was the scene of a harrowing betrayal when the 
Vanni LTTE, under orders from LTTE chief 
Prabhakaran and intelligence wing chief Pottu 
Amman, launched a devastating attack across 
its waters against its own Eastern fighters. In 
this grim assault, approximately 210 Eastern 
fighters were mercilessly killed. These fighters, 
under the command of Karuna Amman—the 
then-military leader of the LTTE's Batticaloa 
and Ampara districts—were tragically 
caught in the crossfire due to escalating 
internal disagreements with LTTE supremo 
Prabhakaran.
The invasion was a meticulously coordinated 
military operation. The LTTE's formidable 
infantry unit, the Charles Anthony Brigade, 
along with the Sea Tiger unit, artillery, and 
motor units, were all employed in the assault. 
Ironically, almost all the Eastern fighters and 
commanders on the Batticaloa side of the 
Verugal River were oblivious to the impending 
attack. Similarly, most of the rank-and-file 
fighters were also unaware of any tension 
between their leadership and the Vanni 
leadership.
The attack on the Eastern fighters commenced 
in the early hours of April 10th, during a 
ceasefire agreement between the Sri Lankan 
government and the LTTE. Most of the 
Eastern fighters, who were deeply asleep, 
initially mistook the assault for an attack 
by the Sri Lankan army. However, as they 
intercepted wireless communications, the 
reality of their situation became starkly 
clear—it was the Vanni Tigers, not the army, 
who were mercilessly attacking them. From 
the intercepted messages, they heard the 
commanding voice of Banu, a key LTTE 
commander, which confirmed their worst 
fears. The Eastern fighters were bewildered and 
could not understand the reasons behind this 
sudden betrayal.
Jayam, a former commander of the Visalakan 
Regiment, told Jaffna Monitor in an exclusive 
interview that at the time of the Vanni Tigers' 
attack on the Eastern Tigers, three divisions 
of the Eastern Tigers were stationed along the 
banks of the Verugal River on the Batticaloa 
Jayam, former commander of the Visalakan Regiment

side. These divisions included the Mathana 
Battalion, a women's unit; the Visalakan 
Battalion, a men's unit; and the Ranjan 
Battalion, a special forces unit. Collectively, 
these three battalions comprised approximately 
500 Eastern fighters.
He also provided insights into the naming 
conventions of the Eastern forces. He noted 
that the formidable fighting force comprised of 
Eastern fighters was known as the Jeyanthan 
Brigade in the North, while it was referred to 
as the Visalakan Regiment in the East. 
Jayam revealed that the high command 
leaders of the Eastern Tigers were aware of 
the tensions between Karuna Amman and 
Prabhakaran. However, most ordinary fighters 
were oblivious to these tensions. 'Nobody 
expected the Vanni Tigers to attack their 
own comrades,' Jayam stated. 'We were not 
prepared for an assault,' he added, pausing 
before continuing, 'We had all the resources 
and manpower, including mortars, to defeat 
them and drive them back, but we were not 
psychologically prepared. How can we fight 
our own fighters?' Jayam celebrated as a hero in 
many significant LTTE attacks, including the 
famous Jayasikkuru assault and the Anaiyiravu 
base camp attack, posed this question.
Karuna Amman, in an exclusive interview 
with Jaffna Monitor, said that while he was 
aware that the Vanni Tigers were coming to 
the Verugal bank, he had also not anticipated 
an attack.
The Vanni Tigers launched their first surprise 
attack on the Mathana Regiment, a female 
fighting force of the Eastern fighters. Savithri, 
the determined commander and one of the 
first victims, disclosed to the Jaffna Monitor 
the unexpected nature of the attack. Unaware

of any potential threats or defence strategies 
due to lack of information from the Eastern 
high command, she described how a Vanni 
Tiger fighter waded across the Verugal River, 
called out 'Savithri akka, Savithri akka,' and 
shot her in the thigh as she emerged, which 
quickly knocked her unconscious. Now 
enjoying a peaceful life away from conflict with 
her husband and children, Savithri reflected on 
that fateful day. She believes the assault was a 
deliberate attempt to dismantle her command. 
'Why aim to disrupt my command? First of all, 
I was not prepared to battle my own brethren,' 
she disclosed.
She explained that her regiment's deployment 
at the riverbank was simply part of their 
routine training exercises. She clarified that 
they were not positioned there to confront the 
Vanni Tigers in case they crossed, contrary 
to what some journalists and writers have 
suggested.
Adding a layer of betrayal, Savithri recounted 
an incident just a day before the attack. A few 
Vanni Tigers had casually crossed the river, 
engaging in a friendly game of volleyball with 
her troops and sharing a meal prepared by her 
regiment. Reflecting on these interactions, she 
now views these seemingly benign activities 
as a calculated reconnaissance effort, cleverly 
disguised beneath layers of camaraderie. This 
revelation casts a stark light on the cunning 
strategic methods that the LTTE leadership, 
especially its intelligence wing chief Pottu 
Amman, employed.
A former prominent fighter from the 
Visalakan battalion, stationed on the Verugal 
River, told the Jaffna Monitor, 'We were not 
instructed on what to do if the Vanni Tigers 
attacked.' Reflecting on it later, he now believes 
that Karuna Amman and his key commanders 
might have wanted to demonstrate the 
strength of the eastern fighting forces, which 
could explain why he ordered a few regiments 
to be at the Verugal bank. 
In a discussion with Jaffna Monitor, Karuna 
Amman dismissed this claim, stating that

Regiment

stationing regiments at the Verugal River is 
standard procedure. 'The forces deployed 
on the Batticaloa side of the Verugal 
River primarily hailed from the Vagarai 
region; this was their standard posting,' he 
explained. 'Additionally, a few regiments 
were temporarily stationed there for training 
purposes over several months,' he added.
In an emotionally charged interview with the 
Jaffna Monitor, Karuna Amman condemned 
the attack on the Verugal River as not only 
inhumane but also cowardly. He recounted 
how the Vanni Tigers crossed the river at 
midnight and launched a brutal attack that 
explicitly targeted the women's unit, resulting 
in the deaths of many innocent women. 
He revealed that after his decision to split 
from the LTTE, he wrote earnest letters to 
LTTE chief Prabhakaran and its political wing 
leader, S. P. Tamilselvan, pleading for the 
safety of the Eastern fighters. He implored the 
LTTE leadership to refrain from attacking the 
Eastern fighters and subtly suggested, 'If you 
are clever enough, you can kill me, but you 
should spare my fighters.'
Karuna Amman describes the Vanni Tigers' 
actions not just as a brutal attack but as a 
full-scale military operation, complete with 
heavy weapons. This assertion was confirmed 
by Jeyam, the commander of the Visalakan 
Regiment, and by Pillayan, a former LTTE 
commander who now serves as Sri Lanka's 
State Minister for Rural Road Development, in 
discussions with the Jaffna Monitor. 
Pillayan also said that when he was contacted 
by the Vanni Tigers, who used sugar-coated 
talks to persuade him to return, he posed a 
critical question reflecting on the history of 
the Tigers. He recounted asking Banu and 
Ramesh, who were trying to win him back 
over the phone, 'I scolded the Vanni Tigers 
who did not come when the clouds of war 
engulfed us in the East. Why are they now 
displaying bravery in peacetime?' Pillayan says 
that in LTTE history, Eastern fighters went 
to the North to fight and die, but Northern 
fighters never came East to fight. He told the

Jaffna Monitor that none of the Northern 
regiments or fighters had previously ventured 
to the East to battle the Sri Lankan army.
Unlike Pillayan, Jimkelly Thatha, and Robert—
who were celebrated for their roles in the 
Jayasikurui Battle and the Elephant Pass Camp 
attack—other notable figures such as the LTTE 
Batticaloa district political wing leader Turai, 
Visu, and Nisam were swayed by the sugar-
coated talks of Pottu Amman and his team. 
This persuasion led 18 key LTTE commanders 
to return to the Vanni Tigers.
Tragically, upon their return, they were 
deceitfully arrested and met with gruesome 
fates. Robert and Jimkelly Thatha were 
horrifically tied to a tree, doused with 
kerosene, and allegedly burned alive in Panchi 
Marathadi. 
There are many versions of the burning 
incident; while many claim that these 
commanders were burned to death, a 
few allege they were shot dead, and their 
bodies were then burned. Additionally, 
there is ambiguity surrounding who was 
the perpetrator of this heinous crime. Some 
suggest it was ordered by Ramesh—the 
Eastern commander after Karuna—while 
others suggest it was carried out by Nagulan, 
a right-hand man of Pottu Amman, who 
now resides near the Neerveli Kandaswamy 
Temple in Neerveli South and has taken up 
farming after surrendering to the military in 
the last war. Karuna Amman has repeatedly 
stated in interviews with the Jaffna Monitor 
that Nagulan was responsible for this heinous 
crime. However, he also stated that Nagulan 
could not have acted alone; the orders must 
have come from LTTE supremo Prabhakaran 
and its intelligence wing head, Pottu Amman.
Eastern fighters stationed at the Verugal River, 
who miraculously escaped the bloodbath, 
shared their harrowing experiences with 
the Jaffna Monitor. They recounted how the 
Vanni Tigers, led by commanders Banu and 
Ramesh, employed the most brutal tactics. 
The Eastern Tigers, reluctant to confront 
their own brethren, attempted to retreat but 
were ruthlessly pursued, hunted down, and 
mercilessly executed. Those who surrendered 
were bound, forced to their knees, and shot 
dead in cold blood.

values espoused by freedom movements 
worldwide, female fighters from the East who 
surrendered were stripped and forced to kneel 
on scorching sand and hot stones. A few grief-
stricken residents of Kathiraveli confirmed the 
atrocities perpetrated on the Eastern women 
fighters by the Vanni male Tigers.
A resident of Kathiraveli posed a question that 
left us at a loss for words. With a tremor in 
his voice reflecting his dismay and disbelief, 
he asked, 'The LTTE proclaimed itself a 
liberation movement, fighting for a separate 
nation, and even took pride in championing 
women's rights. How could it be,' he wondered 
aloud, his voice laden with a mix of anger and 
sorrow, 'that such an organization could even 
contemplate stripping its own female fighters?' 
His question hung in the air.
He continued, his voice heavy with grief: 'From 
the banks of the Verugal River to the next 
village, Kathiraveli, the bodies of the Eastern 
Tigers were strewn about like discarded 
remnants of a forgotten struggle. These 
fighters, who had once carried the dream of 
Tamil Eelam in their hearts, now lay forgotten, 
their bodies abandoned and decaying along 
the banks of the Verugal River and throughout 
the village of Kathiraveli.' He paused, his 
sorrow palpable in the silent air around us. 'As 
they walked over the remains of the Eastern 
fighters, the Vanni Tigers, following the cold 
directives of Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman, 
callously mocked and laughed,' he said, the 
bitterness evident in his tone. 'How could they 
betray their own with such cruelty?
The horrified residents of Kathiraveli village, 
confronted with the grim scene of dead bodies 
scattered throughout their village, attempted 
to bury these bodies. However, they were 
intimidated and turned away at gunpoint by 
the Vanni Tigers. Arumugam, a villager from 
Kathiraveli, reported to the Jaffna Monitor 
that the Vanni Tigers would not allow the 
villagers to cremate the bodies. As the bodies 
began to decay and emit a horrible stench, the 
Vanni Tigers continued to prohibit cremation. 
After several days and many confrontations, 
the Vanni Tigers finally allowed the villagers 
to bury the bodies. Visibly saddened and 
exhausted, Arumugam told us in a voice heavy 
with grief that he and his team alone buried 
around 80 bodies of the Eastern fighters.
Almost all the commanders, including Karuna 
Amman, had no intention of fighting the 
Vanni Tigers, as they lacked motivation and 
were not mentally prepared for confrontations 
with those they considered their own brothers. 
Many commanders, such as Jimkelly Thatha, 
Robert, and Jeyam, fled to Colombo, where 
they lived in hiding without any arms, hoping 
to go abroad. Meanwhile, the Vanni LTTE 
cunningly lured Jimkelly Thatha, Robert, and 
a few others back to Batticaloa and horrifically 
killed them. Subsequently, the LTTE leadership 
launched a gruesome campaign against those 
who refused to return. Many Eastern fighters 
who refused were brutally gunned down by 
the Vanni Tigers in the heart of Colombo, with 
some being killed right in front of visa agents' 
offices.
At this juncture, a harrowing episode unfolded 
in Kottawa, a significant suburb of Colombo, 
marked by a cunning strategy typical of Pottu 
Amman that would forever alter the history 
of the LTTE. Fourteen distinguished Eastern 
commanders and fighters, including Pillayan, 
Castro, Kuganesan, Arbaran, Kesavan Master, 
Ruben, Arvalan, and Riyaseelen, sought refuge 
in a residence while they prepared to apply for 
visas, hoping to leave the country. 
In the absence of Pillayan, Mark, and four 
others, a fellow fighter named Thamanan,

acting on orders from the Vanni Tigers, 
administered poison to the group. Following 
this act of treachery, Pottu Amman's hit squad 
stormed the house and brutally executed 
seven of the Eastern fighters in their beds. 
Thamanan, the perpetrator of this cold-
blooded poisoning, still resides in Santhiveli, 
Batticaloa.
The Kottawa poisoning murder indeed 
marked a turning point in the history of the 
LTTE. After this incident, the Eastern fighters 
became acutely aware that the 
LTTE leadership would neither 
allow them to live peacefully nor 
permit them to go abroad. Feeling 
as if Pottu Amman's men would 
hunt them forever if they did 
not retaliate, they told the Jaffna 
Monitor that they decided enough 
was enough. Regrouping with 
renewed resolve, they returned to 
the East and launched fierce attacks 
on the Vanni Tigers. 
Now imbued with a renewed sense 
of motivation and a clear vision 
to expel the Vanni Tigers from 
Eastern soil, these fighters engaged 
with unprecedented ferocity. 
The initial offensive was launched 
on Ayithiya Malai near Unnichaikulam, 
masterfully orchestrated by Pillaiyan and 
Tumilan's team. By 2007, the Eastern province 
was declared free of Tiger presence, marking a 
significant shift in the conflict's dynamics.
A former Eastern fighter poignantly reflected 
on the LTTE's downfall, attributing it to the 
leadership's inability to handle dissent and 
differing opinions wisely. "The LTTE lost a 
loyal province that had consistently supplied 
thousands of fighters," he said. "Whenever 
there was trouble in the North, we Eastern 
fighters were there, winning battles for our 
leader Prabhakaran. But when he faced his 
darkest hour in early 2009, there were no 
Eastern fighters to come to his aid."
He continued, his voice laden with sorrow and 
regret, "The Tiger leadership's arrogance and 
senseless actions on Eastern soil alienated a 
remarkable group of fighters who had once 
been fiercely loyal to them. And so, they met 
their end in May 2009, abandoned like corpses 
in the marshes of Nanthi Kadal.
Former Visalakan Brigade 
Commander Jeyam narrated an 
intriguing tale. He said, 'This 
is how the LTTE leadership 
operated from its inception, 
and it was their SOP (standard 
operating procedure). They 
annihilated anyone who was 
not aligned with them or who 
slightly differed from them. LTTE 
leadership branded other Tamil 
militant organizations, who also 
took arms for the same course, 
and their fighters as traitors and 
mercilessly hunted down them, 
and nobody raised their voice. 
He says Initially, people were not 
supportive of the LTTE's ruthless killings, but 
over time, they began to support them. This 
gave the LTTE leadership a sense of impunity, 
believing that no matter whom they killed or 
what they did, nobody could challenge them. 
He concluded with a deep smile, 'The Vanni 
Tigers thought they could kill us in the same 
way, but they failed to understand that we were 
also Tigers.'

reluctant to revisit the painful memories of 
the Verugal massacre, which still brings her 
immense pain, she eventually consented 
to share her experiences after considerable 
persuasion. Here is our conversation with her.
Were you aware beforehand that 
the Vanni Tigers might launch an 
attack?
No, there were no prior indications of an 
impending attack, nor had we received 
instructions on how to respond. The attack 
caught us completely off guard. Additionally, 
the supposed divide between the Vanni Tigers 
and Eastern Tigers didn't exist; we were united, 
fighting for a common dream. As for myself 
and the other fighters in my regiment, we were 
fully committed to our cause. We had joined the 
struggle for Tamil Eelam, placing our complete 
trust in our leader, Prabhakaran.
Even those positioned across the Verugal 
River who came to attack us were our kin; 
among our attackers were our relatives and 
friends—cousins, nieces, and nephews. We saw 
no distinction between fighters from the East 
and the North. It never crossed our minds that 
they might attack us or how we would defend 
against such an assault. 
How could we possibly engage in battle with our 
own siblings? How could we bring ourselves to 
attack them?
Were any preemptive measures 
taken in anticipation of the attack?
No preemptive measures were taken. The 
possibility of an attack being ordered against 
our own affiliates was beyond our expectations, 
and consequently, we were unprepared for 
either an offensive or defensive response.
Why was your regiment positioned along the 
banks of the Verugal River? Some journalists 
and writers have suggested that eastern fighters, 
including your unit, were deployed by Karuna 
Amman to potentially engage the Vanni Tigers 
should they attempt to cross the river.
Those reports are entirely inaccurate and 
speculative. It is standard practice for our units 
to spend one to two months in the Vakarai and 
Verugal areas strictly for training purposes. 
Although we often met with family members 
during these periods, our presence in these 
locations focused solely on training. There 
were no intentions or preparations for combat 
during our stay.
Did the Vanni Tigers stationed on 
the other side of the Verugal River 
communicate with your regiment?
Yes, they would communicate. We all viewed 
ourselves as brothers and sisters. Those fighters 
would casually cross the river to chat with us. 
We often played volleyball together. Even the 
day before the attack began, the Tigers across 
the Verugal River joined us for volleyball and 
shared the meal we had prepared at our camp. 
We harboured no suspicions at all. Given our 
shared language, ethnicity, organizational 
affiliation, and common cause, it was difficult 
to entertain any doubts about them.
How many female fighters were 
there under your command?
In my command, there were 450 female 
fighters from 3 companies. Out of them, 200 
fighters went to Verugal for training. The others 
remained in Tharavai.

Jaffna Monitor

What kind of training was provided 
in Verugal? 
Regular 
combat 
training 
and 
physical 
strengthening exercises were provided.
What happened in the early morning 
of April 10th, 2004?
They launched an invasion, and I was one of the 
initial victims. My memories are fragmented as 
the first shots fired targeted me directly; one of 
the assailants shot me at point-blank range in 
the thigh, shattering my leg. This assault was 
clearly aimed at incapacitating my command. 
As the gunfire continued, I managed to call for 
assistance from Jayam Anna, my senior in the 
LTTE ranks, before losing consciousness. After 
that, I fainted and had no recollection of the 
events that followed.
Did they shoot you with the intention 
to kill?
I can't say for sure. Those who shot me at point-
blank range in the thigh could have aimed 
at my head as well. I believe they hit me to 
incapacitate my command and destabilize our 
forces. Even if they had spared me, I wouldn't 
have been able to order an attack on them. How 
can one attack their own brothers?
But those who attacked, or those 
who gave the command, did not 
share your sentiments, did they?
Regardless, they are still my brothers. To this 
day, that's how I see them. I hold no anger 
towards them. We ate together, and we shared 
the same dream, Tamil Eelam. And we were 
fighting for our leader, Prabhakaran. 
But they ruthlessly killed many 
innocent girls from your regiment, 
didn't they?
That reflects their moral standards, and this 
is mine. We all joined the fight driven by the 
Karuna Amman alongside his Eastern female fighters
