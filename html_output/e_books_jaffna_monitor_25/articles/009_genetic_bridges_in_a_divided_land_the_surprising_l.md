A 
Landmark Study Reveals Surprising Ties 
Between Sri Lankan Ethnic Groups in 
Longstanding Conflict: Sinhalese and Tamils. 
This revelation comes at a pivotal time when 
understanding and unity are paramount.
The Study: A Journey into Genetic 
History
Published in the prestigious journal iScience, 
this research represents a five-year collaboration 
between Indian and Sri Lankan scientists from 
institutions such as Banaras Hindu University 
and the University of Colombo. Their mission 
was to unravel the genetic history of Sri Lanka's 
ethnic groups, leading to significant findings 
scientifically, socially, and historically.
Sri Lanka's Ethnic Mosaic: More 
Similar Than Different
The study focused on the Sinhalese, who 
make up 74.9% of the population, and the Sri 
Lankan Tamils, comprising 11.1%. Contrary to 
previous beliefs based on cultural and linguistic 
differences, these groups are genetically 
closer to each other than to any other South 
Asian population. This challenges long-held 
perceptions of ethnic divisions in Sri Lanka 
and offers a new perspective on its societal 
dynamics.
Tracing the Roots: A Shared Origin
The study finds that both the Sinhalese and 
Sri Lankan Tamils trace their origins to India 
around 500 BC. The Sinhalese migrated from 
western India, while the Sri Lankan Tamils 
came from the south. Over centuries, their 
genes significantly mingled, creating a shared 
genetic tapestry that transcends modern ethnic 
and linguistic boundaries.
The Scientific Breakthrough: A New 
Level of Genetic Mapping

genetic analysis. It examined various types of 
half a million genetic mutations, providing 
an unprecedented comprehensive view. This 
robust approach, involving 834 DNA samples, 
conclusively demonstrates the shared genetic 
heritage of these groups.
Beyond Boundaries: Unusual Genetic 
Flow
A key discovery is the strong gene flow between 
the Sri Lankan Tamils and Sinhalese, which 
is uncommon in South Asia, where ethnicity 
and language often define genetic boundaries. 
This genetic interchange suggests a history of 
an integrated society, challenging traditional 
ethnic separations.
Decoding Legends: Sinhala's Origins 
Confirmed
Additionally, the research sheds light on the 
debated origins of the Sinhala people. While 
legends trace their roots to Sinhapura in India, 
the exact location has been a topic of scholarly 
debate. The study confirms that the Sinhala 
people originated from North-West India, 
resolving a longstanding controversy.
A New Chapter of Understanding
More than tracing genetic histories, this 
landmark study initiates a dialogue about 
shared origins and interconnected futures. In 
a world often divided along ethnic lines, these 
findings remind us that our genetic makeup 
can narrate a story of unity and shared history, 
guiding us towards a future of unity and mutual 
respect.
