Who else, along with your uncle 
Prabhakaran, are you planning to 
commemorate?
We will remember Uncle Prabhakaran, Aunt 
Mathivathani, 
younger 
Brother 
Charles 
Anthony, sister Thuvaraga, and youngest 
Brother Balachandran.
When will this be?
I am unable to provide an answer right now. I 
will inform you very soon.
We've heard that Prabhakaran didn't 
believe in God. How do you plan 
to commemorate him according to 
religious practices?
The perception that my uncle did not believe 
in God is not entirely accurate. The Uncle 
Prabhakaran I knew did, in fact, have faith 
in God. Our family background is steeped 
in religious devotion; our ancestors were 
instrumental in building a Shiva temple in 
Valvettithurai, which is a testament to our 
spiritual heritage. Specifically, my uncle 
Prabhakaran was a devotee of Lord Murugan.
In honouring his memory, the memorial we 
plan to conduct will be a private affair deeply 
rooted in our family's religious beliefs and 
practices. While the ceremony will be personal 
and reflect our devotion, we are also mindful of 
the broader community. We intend to ensure 
that the memorial is respectful and sensitive, 
acknowledging the feelings and beliefs of 
others. The involvement of the public will 
be considered in a manner that aligns with 
our family's wishes and the solemn nature of 
the occasion. Our aim is to create a space of 
reverence and respect, honouring my uncle's 
memory in a way that is true to our family's 
spiritual values.
Could you explain the motivation 
behind the decision, especially after 
a span of 14 years?
The 
decision 
to 
commemorate 
Uncle 
Prabhakaran and his family publicly stems 
from a pressing need to counteract certain 
groups' 
inappropriate 
and 
unfortunate 
exploitation of their names for financial gain. 
These individuals have been using the legacy of 
my uncle and his family for their own benefit, 
which has necessitated a response from us, 
not only to uphold their dignity but also to 
conclusively dispel the false narratives that they 
are still alive. My uncle and his family achieved 
martyrdom.
By organizing this event, we aim to firmly 
underline this truth and to bring closure to 
these unfounded claims. Additionally, this 
commemoration serves a deeper, more solemn 
purpose. It is an occasion for us to seek peace 
for their departed souls. 
Has there been any private 
commemoration of them by your 
family in the past?
Yes, my parents have been conducting 
private commemorations annually. These 
observances are not aligned with a specific date 
on the English calendar but follow the Tamil 
Thithi corresponding to the date of Uncle 
Prabhakaran's passing on May 18, 2009. This 
involves a day of fasting and the preparation of 
a vegetarian meal at noon, practices in which 
we all partake. However, we have decided to 
extend these commemorations to a public 
forum this year.

n December 4th, 2020, a teenager a few days shy of his 
19th birthday is up against Angelo Mathews, the last man 
standing from Sri Lanka's golden generation. On his debut, 
the teenager bravely tosses the ball up in the air. Not requiring 
a second invitation, Mathews attempts to clear the long-off 
boundary. However, the ball hits the edge of the bat and lands 
safely in the hands of the long-off fielder. The youngster is 
elated, and so too are his team and supporters.
Fast forward to February 17th, 2024; three years later, the 
youngster is at it again. This time, however, he's not in an

empty Hambantota but in the bustling Dubai 
International Cricket Stadium. Representing 
MI Emirates, a subsidiary of one of the 
world's most powerful and dominant cricket 
franchises, he showcases his talent. Delivering 
an economical performance and featuring 
among the wicket-takers, he stands out 
even amidst a galaxy of stars, winning the 
'Dressing Room Player of the Match' award. 
Remarkably, this isn't his first, but his third 
such recognition within a week. This isn't 
just the Jaffna Kings; it's a conclave of global 
superstars. What an incredible journey it has 
been for him.
You might think the youngster has truly made 
his mark, but has he really? In the world of 
cricket, where players like Natarajans and 
Shamar Josephs rise to the top within months, 
Vijayakanth Viyaskanth's journey may seem 
painstakingly slow. Perhaps it is, especially 
since he hasn't yet made a significant impact 
in the domestic circuit. This can be frustrating, 
but in reality, it might be the best thing for 
him. Viyas is seen as the boy who broke the 
invisible barrier preventing players from 
outside major cities from playing for Sri Lanka. 
He rose to prominence on merit, thanks to 
a considerate franchise, the Jaffna Stallions, 
known for their passion and long-term

commitment to nurturing talent. He became 
a symbol of hope, not just for the Stallions but 
for all of Sri Lanka's remote regions. It's natural 
to expect such a beacon of hope to quickly 
ascend to national colours and complete 
a success story. However, Viyas's gradual 
progress could be more beneficial for him 
and the country in the long run. Doubt this 
approach? Then, consider the case of Yasaswi 
Jaiswal, India's newest sensation. His journey, 
marked by a grind through Ranji Trophy 
games and dominance there, shaped him into 
the player he is today.
With expectations soaring, pressure will engulf 
Viyas. He has set his own benchmark now. 
Technically, he is some distance away from 
being a fully developed player. However, every 
single time he has reappeared on the biggest 
stage, he has shown tremendous improvement. 
Till a few days ago, Viyas's signature was his 
inspirational story. But after his showing at the 
ILT20, it's his skill. He will not celebrated for 
the journey he has come but will be gauged on 
the competence he displays. The mere fact that 
MI Emirates backed him to be part of their 
lineup for the final is proof of the same. 
The journey will become tougher, competition 
will decode him and try to flatten him, mouths 
that praise will criticise, expectations will 
transform into pressure, and narratives will 
become different. As anyone who has travelled 
the journey will testify, it will be a whole new 
game. Would Viyas sustain himself? 
All signs indicate that he surely will succeed. 
Despite the adulation and exposure on 
the biggest stage, Viyas appears to remain 
grounded. How he continues to maintain this 
composure will be crucial in deciding his fate. 
For the sake of many who dream of following 
in his footsteps, we should hope and pray 
that he continues to forge a path for others to 
emulate, reaching ever higher. For now, the 
signs are good.
As fans, it might be tempting to see him 
in national colours soon. But as Mahela 
mentioned in the post-match interview 
following the ILT20 final, it's time for Viyas 
to prove his prowess on the domestic circuit. 
Luckily for Viyas, unlike many in the past, he 
has found himself in the right places at the 
right times, and with exposure to the Mumbai 
Indians, it's hard to miss the eyeballs if he 
keeps improving as he has been. His showing 
on the biggest franchise stages will surely pave 
the way for the ultimate destination. While he 
will surely have to break the door open to get 
selected for the national team, the good news 
is he has the most advanced tools through 
franchise cricket to do so. His time will surely 
come; until then, let's enjoy his journey and 
allow him to enjoy the journey without putting 
on unwanted pressure.
Go well, Viyas. You are an inspiration, but you 
should be much, much more than that, and 
hopefully, you will be!
