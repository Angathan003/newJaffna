gained prominence in Tamil political circles, 
largely due to their advocacy for ultra-Tamil 
nationalism, a stance advocating for extreme 
measures in support of Tamil rights and 
identity. In this context, Shritharan's remarks, 
coming from a noted Tamil nationalist 
himself, are seen by political analysts as a 
strategic maneuver in the contest to lead the 
ultra-nationalist Tamil agenda. Observers 
suggest that this approach could potentially 
give Shritharan an upper hand in the political 
rivalry.
Sritharan's allegations centered around the 
controversial 'white flag' incident during the 
final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 
2009, in which several LTTE leaders, including 
the LTTE's political head, Balasingham 
Nadesan, and peace secretariat, Seevaratnam 
Pulidevan, were killed. He accused 
Ponnambalam of being intricately involved in 
the events, acting as a mediator with the Sri 
Lankan government, leading to the surrender 
of LTTE leaders, and questioned his silence 
on the matter. Sritharan insinuated that 
Ponnambalam's reticence could be an attempt 
to shield certain powerful individuals from 
scrutiny.
Further intensifying his attack, Sritharan 
raised questions about Kajendrakumar 
Ponnambalam's role in negotiating on 
behalf of the LTTE with Marie Colvin 
during the surrender process. He scrutinized 
Ponnambalam's interactions and negotiations 
with her, challenging Ponnambalam to disclose 
his communications and actions during this 
critical period. Sritharan asserted that the 
public deserves transparency on these matters.
Sritharan also demanded that Secretary-
General of Tamil National People's Front S. 
Kajendren publicly clarify how he managed 
to secure the release of his brother from the 
clutches of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka's 
former powerful defence secretary, and he 
also challenged Kajendren to a public debate 
regarding this.
Sritharan's allegations did not stop there. He 
questioned the fate of university students who 
had associated with Kajendran when he was 
the president of the Jaffna University Students' 
Union and the ones he recruited for war, 
particularly focusing on the case of a student 
named Paraneetharan from Neduntheevu. He 
said that his sister is still unmarried, waiting 
for her brother's return. He accused Kajendran 
of failing to fulfill promises made to these 
students, suggesting a breach of trust.
"Delving into Kajendran's political history, 
Sritharan recalled his election as an MP in 
2004 and his dramatic claim in Parliament 
about the arrival of 40,000 soldiers' coffins 
in Colombo from Jaffna. He scrutinized 
Kajendran's subsequent five-year absence 
from the country and questioned the nature 
of the deal he might have made with then-
defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to 
return to Sri Lanka and re-enter politics. 
Sritharan strongly hinted that a deal between 
Kajendran and Gotabaya must have existed, 
considering the numerous murders and 
disappearances of political rivals and critics 
during Rajapaksa's peak in power. He also 
suggested that this clandestine deal could have 
been facilitated through the famous defense 
analyst Rohan Gunaratna, who resided in 
Singapore. Furthermore, Sritharan demanded 
transparency regarding how Gajendran 
allegedly secured a lecturer position for his 
brother at Jaffna University.
Shritharan's address took a broader swipe at 
the integrity of the Tamil National People's 
Front (TNPF), accusing its members of deceit 
and hypocrisy. He particularly highlighted

their public endorsement of Mahinda 
Rajapaksa's return to power, citing the example 
of Arunthavabalan, who openly supported 
Rajapaksa's comeback. Sritharan questioned 
the TNPF's true agenda and the interests they 
represent, suggesting deep-seated duplicity 
within the party. 
In his intense interview, Shritharan aimed 
to unveil what he sees as the hidden 
realities and contradictions in his political 
adversaries' actions, casting doubt on their 
true commitment to the Tamil community. 
His statements, particularly noteworthy 
from someone with his Tamil nationalist 
background, were directed at Kajendrakumar 
Ponnambalam and Kajendran, known for 
their radical Tamil nationalist views. This 
clash has sparked vibrant discussions within 
Tamil circles in Jaffna, with some perceiving 
it as a battle between leaders of comparable 
ultra-Tamil nationalist ideologies, each 
eager to assert themselves as the preeminent 
nationalist.
Adding to this political dynamic, 
Kajendarkumar's party, the Tamil National 
People's Front (TNPF), secured two 
parliamentary seats in the last election, largely 
attributed to their extreme Tamil nationalist 
stance. At the same time, the Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA), led by R. Sampanthan and 
influenced by Sumanthiran, took a more 
moderate approach to Tamil nationalism. This 
moderation contributed to TNPF's success in 
securing those two seats. Now, with the newly 
elected president of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Kachchi (the main and largest component of 
TNA) adopting a more pronounced Tamil 
nationalist stance, political observers note that 
this shift is likely to affect TNPF's political 
standing in the upcoming election.
