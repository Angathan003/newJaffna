Gotabaya Rajapaksa, but from what I've heard, 
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was stubborn 
and refused to listen to them. He was adamant 
about continuing on his chosen path, and 
nothing could sway him. Chamal didn't tell 
me directly how the meeting went, but that's 
what I've gathered from those who were in the 
know. It was a tragic situation where everyone 
saw the impending disaster, but no one could 
get through to him.  
You've been Mahinda Rajapaksa's 
close friend and a key figure in the Sri 
Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). 
But now, you're aligned with Ranil 
Wickremesinghe. Is that the right 
move?
I'm not aligned with Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
As the Speaker, I must remain neutral and 
cannot be associated with any individual or 
party.
Then, in your opinion, who do you 
think would be the best presidential 
candidate to steer the country out of 
this economic crisis?
  "Prabhakaran was an overestimated man".
