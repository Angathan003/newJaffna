the killing of opponents. Despite their current 
assertions of reform, there is little evidence to 
convince the nation of their transformation. 
Additionally, there are accusations that even 
within the party, they are two-faced.
The current political situation is volatile, 
largely because the JVP has exploited the 
mistakes of traditional politicians and center-
left and center-right parties. Since the dawn 
of independence, these established political 
forces have made errors that eventually led to 
the Aragalaya (The Struggle), culminating in 
then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the 
country.
The suffering of the people during this period 
was immense, fueling their opposition to the 
government to the point of driving it out. This 
created an opportunity for the extreme left 
JVP to seize the moment quietly but effectively, 
gaining the public's confidence by asserting 
that the nation's problems stemmed from 
those in power misusing their authority.
Do you believe the JVP-led National 
People's Power (NPP) has a chance in 
this election?
It's an open election, as no clear winner has 
emerged, making it difficult to predict the 
outcome until the votes are counted. All main 
candidates have a chance.
What percentage chance do they have 
of securing a victory in this election?
It's hard to pinpoint with accuracy right now. 
There are three main candidates. Two of 
them have traditionally represented centrist 
parties, while one previously aligned with 
the extreme left but now claims to be more 
centrist. Historically, support for the extreme 
left hovered around 3 percent, but this time 
it's undeniably stronger and may even be the 
strongest in some areas. I prefer not to give 
specific figures, as that might influence public 
opinion.
When you say "some areas," are you 
referring to specific districts?
Not districts, but rather smaller regions, like 
AGA divisions.
Do you think the Sinhala people have 
forgotten the past atrocities committed 
by the JVP?
I wouldn't say they've completely forgotten, but 
a substantial number of people seem to have 
moved on. This shift is evident in the support 
the JVP is now receiving, especially from the 
younger generation who did not witness the 
JVP's violent past firsthand. While the older 
generation may have shared these stories, the 
impact isn't the same for those who didn't 
live through it. This lack of direct experience, 
combined with the perception that the NPP 
is more center-left than the JVP, is why many 
young people are now gravitating toward 
them.
