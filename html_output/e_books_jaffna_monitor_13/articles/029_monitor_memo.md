R
esidents of Vavuniya 
and neighbouring 
regions are grappling with 
mounting frustration as they 
face prolonged waits—some 
extending over five days-at the 
Vavuniya Regional Immigration 
and Emigration Department. 
Despite the extended queues, 
many have yet to receive their 
passports, resulting in a chaotic 
situation that recently required 
police intervention.
The department is structured to 
process 60 passport applications 
daily: 25 under the regular

service, 25 under the expedited one-day 
service, and an additional 10 for those whose 
applications have been delayed beyond 
the promised timeframe. However, glaring 
inefficiencies have surfaced as citizens wait in 
line daily, often leaving without their much-
needed travel documents.
The affected individuals include those who 
applied for passports as early as March, as 
well as people with urgent travel needs for 
employment, education, or significant family 
events abroad. The department’s failure to 
meet its daily processing quotas has created 
a severe backlog, forcing these residents to 
endure harsh conditions and uncertainty.
The situation reached a tipping point recently 
when a commotion, driven by the desperation 
of those who had been waiting for days, 
escalated to the extent that police were called 
in to restore order. This incident underscores 
the inefficiency within the department and the 
emotional and physical strain placed on the 
public.
In the wake of the unrest, department officials 
addressed the gathered crowd, offering 
explanations for the delays and assurances 
of future improvements. However, these 
reassurances have done little to ease the 
frustration of those who have already endured 
multiple days of waiting, with no certainty of 
when they will receive their passports.
The growing public dissatisfaction highlights 
the urgent need for a more efficient and 
transparent process within the department. 
Immediate reforms are essential to ensure 
that citizens can obtain their essential travel 
documents in a timely manner, without the 
added burden of repeated visits and extended 
wait times.
