he decided to run for President, intellectuals 
rallied behind him, promoting the idea that 
this was the first time in Sri Lanka's history 
such a cadre of intellectuals had supported a 
presidential candidateâ€”and there was some 
truth to that.
The problem arose when President Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa began to believe that his victory 
was largely due to the influence of these 
intellectuals.
While they may have contributed to his 
campaign, particularly among a specific 
educated class, I don't believe they were the 
primary reason he won. His victory was 
primarily due to the overwhelming support 
of the majority Sinhala population. He didn't 
feel the need to rely on the votes of the 
Muslim and Tamil communities, which is 
why, after his inauguration at Ruwanwelisaya 
in Anuradhapura, he made the ill-advised 
statement about winning solely with Sinhala 
votes.
Do you think that statement was a 
mistake?
Absolutely, it was a huge mistake. I know that 
both the Tamil and Muslim communities 
supported him to some extent, so I can't 
fathom why he made such a divisive statement. 
It alienated the very people he needed to 
bring together to heal the country. Instead of 
fostering unity, it only deepened the divisions. 
Once elected as a leader, you need to look after 
the interests of everyone, both those who voted 
for you and those who didn't. Even if you 
don't rely on their support, you must strive to 
be inclusive. That's how you reduce resistance 
and build a stronger nation. The writers of 
that speech had an interest in keeping the 
President confined within their own agenda, 
and unfortunately, he fell prey to it.
Did you ever try to advise Gotabaya 
directly on any important issues?
Yes, I did. One particular instance that stands 
out was when I tried to advise him on the issue 
of banning chemical fertilizers. Having served 
as the Minister of Agriculture, I had a good 
understanding of the complexities involved. 
I approached him and said, 'Please, don't ban 
chemical fertilizers entirely and abruptly. This 
isn't practical.'
I emphasized that if he wanted to introduce 
organic fertilizers, it should be done gradually, 
starting with one district or a specific area. 
I suggested implementing organic farming 
through a pilot project in one district, 
involving local farmers and creating a 
specialized organic market in Colombo, 
similar to the 'Green Markets' in Germany.
I explained that you can't just switch from 
chemical fertilizers to organic overnight, 
especially since much of our agricultural 
research, particularly for paddy, has been 
based on chemical fertilizers. The seed 
varieties we currently use are specifically 
developed to respond well to these fertilizers. 
I urged him to consider a gradual transition 
over 5 to 10 years to maintain our self-
sufficiency in rice production.
What was Gotabaya's response to your 
suggestions?
