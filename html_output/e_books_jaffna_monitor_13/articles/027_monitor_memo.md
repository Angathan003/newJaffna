In a dramatic twist that could rival a wrestling 
match, the first punch (literally!) of the 
Presidential Election was thrown on live TV. 
A heated debate between breakaway MP Velu 
Kumar and MP Palani Thigambaram of the 
Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) quickly 
escalated from verbal sparring to a full-blown 
scuffle. Velu Kumar, who recently defected 
from the TPA to support incumbent President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, found himself in a 
rather physical disagreement with his former 
ally Digambaram.
What started as a war of words over political 
loyalties soon turned into a clash of fists, 
with the MPs exchanging blows before the 
bewildered TV presenters and staff rushed 
in to separate them. As the nation watched 
in shock (and perhaps a little amusement), it 
seems election fever has officially kicked off 
with a bang—or , should we say, a punch!
This wild brawl might just be the first recorded 
instance of election violence in this heated 
race, setting the stage for what promises to be a 
nail-biting—and possibly bruising—campaign 
season.
First Punch of the Polls!
