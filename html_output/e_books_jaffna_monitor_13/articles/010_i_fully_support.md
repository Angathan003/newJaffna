He responded by telling me to 
look at Japan, where he claimed 
everyone was using organic 
fertilizers. I had to explain 
that while some Japanese 
farmers might be using organic 
methods, their situation is 
very different from ours. In 
Japan, rice isn't consumed 
in the same quantities as it is 
here, where rice is a staple for 
all three meals. Moreover, our 
agricultural productivity is 
lower than that of Japan.
I pointed out that no country 
in the world has implemented 
organic farming overnight. 
I suggested using Gampaha 
District as a pilot area for 
organic farming, given its 
proximity to Colombo, which 
is a major market. I proposed 
providing all the necessary 
resources for organic farming 
in this district to ensure that 
the farmers could succeed. 
Gampaha's closeness to the 
capital also meant that we 
could easily monitor and 
support the project.
Why do you think 
Gotabaya didn't take your 
advice?
Unfortunately, he was too set in his ways, heavily influenced 
by those around him who lacked practical experience in 
the field. A Buddhist monk, along with other so-called 
intellectuals, played a significant role in convincing President 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa to abruptly ban chemical fertilizers. The 
irony is that neither the monk nor these intellectuals had any 
real understanding of agriculture.
Can you elaborate on the role of the Buddhist monk 
and the intellectuals in influencing Gotabaya's 
decision?
Someone had planted the idea in the monk's mind that 
banning chemical fertilizers would be the absolute solution 
to our agricultural issues, and he took this notion straight 
to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was already heavily 
"I fully support 
the 13th 
Amendment and 
granting more 
rights to the Tamil 
community".
