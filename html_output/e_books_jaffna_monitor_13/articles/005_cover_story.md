s we stepped into the Speaker's residence 
in Borella, we were immediately enveloped 
by a warm, inviting ambience. We were greeted 
by a man of such an unassuming demeanour 
that, were it not for his distinguished position, 
one might easily mistake him for a humble, 
ordinary gentleman.
With infectious enthusiasm, he welcomed 
us and began to recount his golden years 
as the Chairman of Paranthan Chemical 
Company—a little-known chapter in his 
storied life—from the close of 1977 until the 
end of 1983. During this period, he became 
deeply intertwined with the Tamil community 
in a region that pulsed with a Tamil heart.
Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, one of the oldest 
living statesmen in Sri Lanka, is a seasoned 
politician with a career spanning over four 
decades. As the current Speaker of the Sri 
Lankan Parliament, his journey through 
the political landscape has been marked by 
unwavering convictions and bold decisions.
First entering Parliament in 1983, 
Abeywardena quickly distinguished himself 
as a young and outspoken critic, most notably 
opposing the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord—a 
move that cost him his seat and led to him 
being labelled as a Sinhala hardliner by a 
section of Tamil leaders. However, it also 
solidified his reputation as a politician who 
places principles above party lines.
Over the years, he has held various significant 
roles, from Chief Minister of the Southern 
Provincial Council to Minister of Agriculture. 
His influence has been felt both domestically, 
where he played a pivotal role in developing 
neglected infrastructures, and internationally, 
where he was recognized by the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) for his 
contributions to global agricultural policy.
These are excerpts from an extended interview 
we conducted with him.
Sir, you are one of the oldest living 
politicians in Sri Lanka these days. 
How do you see the current situation in 
the country?
The current situation has become highly 
volatile. Centrist parties are losing ground, 
while extreme left-wing parties are gaining 
popularity. This trend is not limited to Sri 
Lanka alone; globally, centrist parties are 
losing support as more extreme right-wing 
and left-wing parties rise in prominence. 
We've witnessed this cycle before, though 
the younger generations may not have. This 
is a normal phenomenon when considering 
the political supercycle, which spans over 
a century. Political sentiment shifts from 
extremes to the center and then back to 
extremes in a cyclical pattern.
What do you mean by extremists?
Typically, I am referring to either extreme 
right or extreme left parties. In Sri Lanka's 
context, I refer specifically to the JVP. Since 
its inception, the JVP has been an extreme 
left-wing political party. Although they have 
recently rebranded and claim to have revised 
their policies to become more centre-left, 
many remain sceptical about the authenticity 
of these changes.
In its early years, the JVP was notorious for 
committing atrocities, including harassment and
