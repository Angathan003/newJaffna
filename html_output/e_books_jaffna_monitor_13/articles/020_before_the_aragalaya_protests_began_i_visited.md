These leaders won the trust of the Sinhala 
people by being there for them and by 
developing deep connections and familiarity. A 
few hardliners tried to sway voters by instilling 
religious and ethnic divides, but it didn't work. 
This shows that our people are not inherently 
racist or divisive—it's the politicians who stir 
up trouble.
In Jaffna, it's a similar story. A few Tamil 
nationalist politicians keep problems 
unresolved. Many of these politicians, 
whether from the past or present, grew up, 
were educated, and live in Colombo. They 
lead affluent lives here, but when they go to 
Jaffna, they talk about separatism to secure 
votes. Some have even married Sinhalese, 
and their children have done the same—
they're practically Sinhalese in every way. 
Yet, in Jaffna, they preach separatism to get 
elected to Parliament and then return to their 
comfortable lives in Colombo. The Tamil, 
Muslim, and Sinhala people need to see 
through these double standards.
Sri Lanka belongs to all of us. The rights I have 
as a Sinhalese are the same rights that Tamils 
and Muslims must have in this country. We 
need to focus on unity, not division, and see 
beyond the narrow agendas of politicians who 
seek to divide us for their own gain. That is my 
request.
As a Speaker, how do you view 
the performance of Tamil MPs in 
Parliament?
None of them are troublemakers. They are 
a very disciplined group of people, and 
their attendance is actually better than that 
of some Sinhalese MPs. Sumanthiran and 
Shanakiyan, in particular, are very efficient 
parliamentarians. However, there are a few 
Tamil politicians who operate with a racist 
mindset, though I prefer not to name them.
The Tamil diaspora is considered a 
significant force. How do you see 
them?
I've met some members of the Tamil diaspora, 
and they're very nice people. Many of them 
want to return and invest in Sri Lanka, 
particularly in North and East areas. They've 
made their money abroad, and bringing that 
investment back home is a positive thing. 
However, there is another segment of the 
diaspora that's more troubling. This group 
seems intent on creating unrest in our country. 
They funnel money to Tamil hardliners here to 
stir up problems, often for their own financial 
gain. They thrive on keeping tensions alive 
so they can continue collecting money from 
abroad. The majority of these problem-causing 
individuals were either part of the LTTE or 
involved in its broader fundraising network. 
It's unfortunate because while some in the 
diaspora genuinely want to help, others seem 
only interested in perpetuating conflict.
"Before the Aragalaya protests began, I visited 
Chamal Rajapaksa and urged him to gather his 
brothers and tell President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
that the path he was on was not right and that 
he needed to change course."
