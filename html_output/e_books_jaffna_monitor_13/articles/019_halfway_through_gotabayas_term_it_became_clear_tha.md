So, would you support a federal 
system of power-sharing with the 
Tamil community?
Right now, federalism is working well in India, 
but you have to remember that one Indian 
state is five or six times bigger than the entire 
country of Sri Lanka. For a small country like 
ours, federalism isn't the main issue—money 
is. The real challenge is ensuring that a steady 
flow of funds is allocated for the development 
of all regions. If we can guarantee continuous 
financial support, the question of federalism 
becomes secondary. The focus should be on 
equitable and consistent development across 
the country.
A section of the Tamil community still 
fears that the kind of ethnic pogroms 
that happened in 1983 might repeat. 
What are your thoughts on this?
That will never happen again. People today 
are much more educated and aware. Just 
look at the Aragalaya movement—do you 
think people would have joined it if they 
weren't facing severe physical and economic 
hardships? Of course not. Times have changed, 
and so have people's mindsets. I can assure you 
that such horrific events will not be repeated.
Do you foresee Tamils and Sinhalese 
living together in harmony?
Absolutely. I believe in this wholeheartedly. 
Whether you visit Jaffna or travel down south, 
you'll notice the same culture, the same values, 
and the same habits. The people are not 
divided, and their problems and needs are the 
same—it's the politicians who drive wedges 
between us for their electoral gain.
Don't you think the government 
should take steps to make the Tamil 
community feel they are a part of Sri 
Lanka? After all, there was a bloody 
30-year war for a separate country, 
and many Sri Lankan Tamils still feel 
alienated from the mainstream. How 
do you think we can instill patriotism in 
them?
The government certainly has a role to play, 
but we must also acknowledge the dirty 
politics at work. Just look at what happens 
during elections in the South—Sinhala 
politicians raise caste issues and exploit 
regionalism among Sinhala voters, even when 
the candidates are all Sinhalese. They'll say, 
'This man is from our area; we must support 
him.' It's the same tactic they use to divide 
people along ethnic lines. It's nothing but dirty 
politics.
When Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim people 
get to know you personally, they don't care 
about your caste, religion, or ethnicity. What 
we need is more mingling and more building 
of friendships. Take, for example, M. H. 
Mohamed, a Muslim, who was elected in 
Borella, a 95 percent Sinhala-majority area. 
Or M.L.M. Aboosally, also a Muslim, who was 
elected in Balangoda, which is 99.9 percent 
Sinhala.
"Halfway through Gotabaya's term, it became clear that 
things were heading in the wrong direction."
