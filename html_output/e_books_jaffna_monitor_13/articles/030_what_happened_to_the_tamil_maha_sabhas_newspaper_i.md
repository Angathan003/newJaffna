W
hen the Tamil Maha Sabha was 
established, Arunachalam recognized 
the need and urgency for a dedicated 
newspaper. However, before he could fully 
plan it, he passed away within a few months. 
Ramanathan, on the other hand, started a 
newspaper called The Ceylonese in Colombo. 
The first issue of this newspaper was published 
on March 5, 1913, with Tom Wright, an 
American, serving as the inaugural editor. The 
newspaper's office operated from Maradana, 
and Arunachalam played a significant role 
in its establishment. Ramanathan initiated 
this newspaper, considering the necessity 
of a nationalist English media when he was 
elected as a Ceylonese representative to the 
Legislative Council. Those who supported 
him in launching this newspaper included 
lawyer Hector Jayewardene, Colonel D.G. 
Jayewardene, Dr. E.V. Ratnam, and lawyer 
Francis de Zoysa.

1911 - Govigama -Vellalar Alliance
There were some interesting political reasons 
behind the creation of this newspaper. 
Ramanathan entered politics in 1879 and 
served continuously in the Legislative Council 
for 13 years, until 1892. However, he did not 
hold this position through an election but 
served as a nominated member.
When his term ended in 1892, he was 
appointed as the Attorney General of Ceylon. 
He held that position for eight years until 
he retired in 1906. After retiring in 1907, he 
initiated the National Reform Movement 
and became involved in political activities. 
However, during this period, he was mostly 
immersed in spiritual duties. Meanwhile, 
in 1910, the number of members in the 
Legislative Council of Ceylon was increased 
from 18 to 21. Of these, 11 were official 
members, while 10 were elected as unofficial 
members as part of that reform.
Of the 11 unofficial members, the positions 
were distributed as follows: one European, 
one elected Burgher, one elected educated 
Ceylonese, two nominated Low-Country 
Sinhalese, two nominated Tamils, one 
nominated Kandyan Sinhalese and one 
nominated Moor. Among them, a system was 
introduced to elect one educated Ceylonese 
through an election.
This could be considered the first opportunity 
to elect a Ceylonese through an election. 
However, only the educated class was eligible 
to vote in this election, meaning that only 
around 3,000 people, or approximately 4% 
of the population, had the right to vote. Dr 
Marcus Fernando came forward to contest 
this election. However, the Sinhala-Buddhist-
Govigama caste-educated and affluent 
elite did not want him to contest. This was 
because Marcus Fernando, despite being a 
Sinhalese, was not from the elevated caste 
of the Sinhalese community. He belonged 
to the Sinhalese Karava (Karaiyar in Tamil) 
caste, which made it unacceptable for certain 
members of the community to see him elected.
At that time, the elite, who were influential 
even among the British rulers, pushed for 
someone from the Govigama caste or an 
equivalent caste to be put forward. Their first 
choice was Ramanathan, who belonged to the 
Tamil equivalent of the Sinhala Govigama  
caste, the Vellalar caste. Ramanathan accepted 
this. For them, it didn't matter if there were 
differences in ethnicity, religion, or language 
at this time. What mattered most was that 
someone of equal caste status should come to 
power, reflecting a caste supremacy mindset. 
This was a period when caste identity was 
given more importance than ethnic identity. 
It was in this way that Marcus Fernando was 
defeated.

In the first election held in 1911 for the 
Legislative Council of Ceylon, Ramanathan 
was elected as the sole representative for 
all Ceylonese. The primary reason the 
Sinhala elite defeated Marcus Fernando and 
ensured Ramanathan's victory was the belief 
that someone from a 'lower caste' should 
not become their representative. Despite 
Ramanathan being Tamil, the fact that he 
belonged to the elevated Vellalar caste made 
him the preferred choice.
Returning to the topic of the newspaper: 
During the 1911 election, The Morning Leader 
newspaper, run by the De Zoysa family, 
criticized Ramanathan and his supporters. 
Marcus Fernando was also from the De Zoysa 
family, so the newspaper worked in favor of 
his victory. However, the educated Sinhala-
Buddhist-Govigama  caste elite strategically 
defeated him. Ramanathan won the election 
with 1,645 votes, while Marcus Fernando 
managed to secure only 981 votes.
Ramanathan, along with the newly elected 
members of the Legislative Council, took 
the oath of office on January 16, 1912. It was 
from that point that he realized the necessity 
of a newspaper, leading to the creation of The 
Ceylonese. However, Ramanathan later had to 
step down from the board of directors of the 
newspaper.1 This was due to a dispute between 
Ramanathan and the other board members, 
who were also shareholders.
This period coincided with the beginning of 
World War I, which saw a rise in the prices 
of paper, ink, and other materials, leading to 
an economic crisis that affected all sectors, 
including The Ceylonese. Additionally, this 
was a time when newspapers faced severe 
censorship, further impacting The Ceylonese. 
1 M.Vythilingam, “Ramanathan of Ceylon: The Life of 
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan”, Volume II, 1977.
In this situation, the Senanayake brothers, 
who were part of the board, decided to sell 
the newspaper. In 1917, amid significant 
losses, F.R. Senanayake announced that the 
newspaper would be auctioned to pay off a 
debt of 21,000 rupees.2
Before purchasing it, their friend, who later 
rose to prominence as a giant in the newspaper 
industry, D.R. Wijewardene, stepped forward. 
However, the auction held in December 1917 
did not reach the target of 21,000 rupees that 
they aimed for. After offering that amount, 
they asked Wijewardene to take over the 
responsibility, but he decided to proceed with 
the auction. The auction moved slowly, and 
after Wijewardene bid 15,000 rupees, no one 
else made an offer. Finally, out of goodwill, 
D.R. Wijewardene provided 16,000 rupees and 
purchased the newspaper.
D.R. Wijewardene, who became known as a 
giant in the Sri Lankan newspaper industry, 
bought the newspaper, renamed it The Ceylon 
Daily News, and began publishing it with 
a new look. The first issue under this new 
name was published on January 3, 1918, and 
it featured a speech by Sir Ponnambalam 
Arunachalam. This newspaper is what 
continues today as the Daily News.
This was the period when the Ceylon National 
Congress was established and active. During 
this time, the need for an English newspaper 
was fully recognized. The efforts for this 
newspaper served as a bridge for dialogue 
between the nationalists and the British rulers. 
Simultaneously, Sinhala newspapers strongly 
opposed the proposals made by the Tamil 
side regarding the Manning Reforms, and 
they propagated racist sentiments. Anagarika

figures like Arunachalam, incited racial hatred 
and raised the slogan 'Sinhala country for 
Sinhalese only.'
In 1921, when Arunachalam was deceived 
by the Sinhala leaders and subsequently 
founded the Tamil Maha Sabha in the same 
year, he realized the necessity of a newspaper 
for the Tamil community. An article related 
to this was published in the Hindu Sadhana 
newspaper on September 20, 1923.
"It reported, 'Last Saturday, a meeting of 
the Ceylon Tamil Maha Sabha was held 
in Colombo under the presidency of Sir 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam. After reading 
a report on the objectives and efforts of the 
Sabha, prominent addresses were delivered 
by Mr. Nevins Selvadurai, the Principal of 
Jaffna Hindu College, and Director Sri K. 
Chidambaranathan. Several resolutions were 
passed at the meeting, with a special resolution 
being the establishment of a daily newspaper 
in Colombo for the Tamil cause."3
From this report, it can be inferred that the 
meeting took place on September 15, 1923.
There is another important point to note. In 
the same newspaper, an extensive article was 
published under the title 'The World in Various 
Ways,' which emphasized the need for such a 
daily newspaper.4
Just four months after this news was published, 
on January 9, 1924, Arunachalam passed away.
3 T. Sabaratnam, The Sri Lankan Tamil Struggle, Chap-
ter 16: The Arunachalam Factor, , November 26, 2010 
(A journalist who reported Sri Lankan ethnic crisis for 
over 50 year)
4 The writer (M. V. Thirugnanasambanda Pillai) was 
the first assistant editor and later editor of The Hindu 
Sadhanam for forty years. He wrote a series of articles 
on the topic "The Diversity of the World." But it did 
not disclose who wrote the articles.
Let's first take a detailed look at that article.
The World in Various Ways:
Last week, at the Tamil Maha Sabha meeting in 
Colombo, presided over by Sir Ponnambalam 
Arunachalam, the topic of establishing a daily 
newspaper in both English and Tamil for the 
Tamil community in the capital was discussed. 
It was mentioned that, as Tamils, apart from 
our population, we are not inferior to the 
Sinhalese in any other aspect. We continue to 
discuss the need for various political rights 
and engage in debates with other communities 
and the government. However, when it comes 
to running a newspaper, we are the most 
disadvantaged among all communities. In 
Colombo, except for the Tamils, all other 
communities have newspapers to present their 
grievances to the government, to address their 
issues, to praise themselves, and to criticize 
other communities. But the fact that there 
is currently no newspaper for the Tamils in 
either English or Tamil in Colombo is a matter 
of great shame.
In Colombo, several newspapers have been 
started by Tamils in both Tamil and English, 
but they have only been run for a short 
period before being discontinued. What 
is the reason for this? Is it due to a lack of 
resources? Lack of wisdom? Or something 
else? Is there no readership? All these reasons 
exist. Many Tamils support newspapers run 
by other communities with money and effort, 
sustaining those newspapers, while the same 
Tamils collaborate with Sinhalese and other 
communities to undermine their own. Some 
Tamils, who align with the Sinhalese and 
others, work against their own community. 
So, if you ask what is lacking among Tamils, it 
is caste pride, unity, and consistency. If these 
existed among Tamils, they could run not just 
one but several Tamil and English newspapers 
in Colombo.

It is well known that while several daily 
newspapers have been long established and 
successfully run by the Sinhalese and other 
communities in Colombo, Tamil efforts to 
start newspapers have often been short-lived, 
frequently stopping after brief intervals. 
The reasons for these newspapers ceasing 
publication lie both with those who run them 
and those who read them.
Most of our Tamil people, when starting 
a newspaper, instead of focusing on the 
development of the Tamil community, tend 
to create divisions by criticizing one group 
and praising another, thus fostering internal 
conflicts. When a group comes together to run 
a newspaper, internal enmities often emerge 
among the members, leading them to use the 
newspaper to settle personal scores, which 
causes trouble for the editor. If the editor 
takes a firm stand, it angers one side, and if 
they try to be neutral, it angers the other side. 
Caught between these conflicting interests, the 
editor ends up in a precarious position, often 
having to leave the job, much like a beggar 
who, having faced many challenges, eventually 
needs to find a way out.
The great wind of greed often blows among 
us Tamils, bringing down all good deeds. 
On the other hand, the Sinhalese and other 
communities, despite any internal conflicts, 
have the quality of cooperating in public 
matters. This is why they find success in their 
endeavors, while we face obstacles in ours.
Some newspapers are started with the sole 
purpose of criticizing someone. Once that 
person is criticized and the issue is settled, the 
newspaper often runs out of content and ceases 
publication. If a long-standing newspaper 
begins to struggle due to financial difficulties, 
some supporters, instead of assisting the 
newspaper in regaining stability, start their 
own newspapers for a few days, only to stop 
them soon after, content with the title of being 
an 'editor' for a brief period.
Now, let's talk about the Tamil readers. I share 
these experiences not to offend anyone but 
to highlight the realities. A few of our Tamil 
people read newspapers with genuine interest 
and loyalty. Many others, however, subscribe 
to newspapers because they consider it part 
of modern civilization. Some subscribe just 
for appearances, while others do so to please 
their families. Some people subscribe to 
newspapers thinking that their family events, 
such as weddings, deaths, job changes, or 
promotions, will be published in them. Others 
subscribe with the intention of canceling the 
subscription later, saying, 'We didn't really 
need the newspaper anyway.'
For newspaper managers and editors, it's 
extremely difficult to deal with such readers. 
If a letter is sent to these readers asking for 
payment, they immediately respond with, 'Stop 
sending the newspaper.' If the editor fails to

publish news about a wedding or death in the 
reader's family, they quickly decide, 'We don't 
need your newspaper.' If a newspaper fails to 
publish a charitable act done by a supporter, 
they might say, 'What's the point of reading 
your newspaper? It doesn't even have a good 
story. Stop sending it.' Others, if the newspaper 
publishes something against their beliefs, 
immediately cancel their subscription. Some 
send letters filled with baseless arguments 
and errors, demanding they be published. 
If the editor refuses, they quickly stop their 
subscription. Some readers become hostile 
towards the editor, thinking that a general 
article was actually written about them. These 
are just some of the challenges faced by editors, 
and listing them all would be too bitter.
These are the reasons why we, as Tamil people, 
struggle to run newspapers properly. I am 
highlighting these issues out of a sense of 
Tamil pride, so I hope no one criticizes me 
for it. We must eliminate these problems, 
develop genuine pride and caste identity, and 
work towards unity. Because the Sinhalese 
have seen our lack of unity, they have no 
hesitation in criticizing our leaders in their 
newspapers. If an outsider criticizes a Tamil, 
other Tamils should unite and defend them, or 
at least sever ties with the critic. Unfortunately, 
when Sinhalese newspapers criticize leaders 
like Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan or Sir 
Ponnambalam Arunachalam, our Tamil people 
still read those newspapers without any shame.
We have read in newspapers that when 
an Indian newspaper criticized the great 
Lokmanya Tilak after his death, many Hindus 
burned copies of that newspaper on the banks 
of the Ganges, and the newspaper's circulation 
dropped significantly. Why can't such pride 
arise among the Tamil people of Sri Lanka? 
Though there are always people like the 
'Koadalik Kaambu,' we should ignore them 
and focus on eliminating our internal issues, so 
that soon we can establish a daily English and 
Tamil newspaper in the city of Colombo. Only 
after addressing these issues should the Tamil 
people engage in the struggle for their rights.
In this context, Thirugnanasambanthapillai 
mentions:
• The Sinhalese in southern Sri Lanka, in 
collaboration with other communities, are 
using Sinhalese newspapers to oppose Tamil 
leaders and Tamil interests. He emphasizes 
the need to find ways to counter this. He 
argues that their strength lies in unity, while 
our weakness is the lack of it. He points out 
that instead of focusing on development, we 
split into groups and attack each other.
• He mentions that some Tamils join forces 
with the Sinhalese to oppose our own Tamil 
people.

• He refers to the incident in India when 
people burned newspapers in the streets 
after an English newspaper wrote slanderous 
articles about Tilak following his death. He 
questions why we do not act similarly.
• He welcomes the proposal for a newspaper 
that can voice Tamil concerns in both Tamil 
and English and stresses its importance. He 
asserts that Tamils have the strength to run 
not just one but several newspapers.
• He explains the financial challenges faced in 
running Tamil newspapers.
• He describes how subscribers, driven by 
their own preferences, say they no longer 
want the newspapers, illustrating how the 
general mindset of the Tamil community 
operates.
• He emphasizes that such a newspaper must 
emerge in the capital, Colombo.
The emergence of Tamil newspapers in Sri 
Lanka dates back to the 19th century. The 
Udayatharakai was the first newspaper to 
be launched. However, it was not a daily 
newspaper. It was published by Christian 
missionaries and included both Christian 
propaganda and public issues. Subsequent 
newspapers were also either Christian-oriented 
or, in opposition, published by Saivite groups. 
This trend persisted for a long time.
Between 1900 and 1930, more newspapers 
were published between 1900 and 1915 than 
between 1915 and 1930. The Hindu Sadhana 
was particularly influential during this period.5 
Meanwhile, the Udayatharakai was in decline. 
Therefore, when an experienced and influential 
5 Rameez Abdullah, Sri Lankan Tamil Journals (1841 
- 1950), Kumaran Book House, Colombo – Chennai - 
2012.
journalist like Thirugnanasambanthapillai 
questioned why a Tamil newspaper couldn't be 
started in Colombo, his concern was entirely 
justified.
'Dravida Kokilam' newspaper, published in 
Colombo in 1902, used Chennai as its base 
and largely focused on issues related to Tamil 
Nadu. Following this, several other newspapers 
with titles such as Dravidan, Adi Dravidan, 
and Dravida Mitran were also published in 
Colombo, targeting readers of Indian descent.6 
However, these too mainly covered topics 
related to Tamil Nadu. Despite the presence of 
some newspapers from Colombo during this 
period, it can be said that there was no stable 
mass-circulation daily until the publication of 
Virakesari in 1930. While Colombo Journal 
was the first newspaper in Sri Lanka, it took 
almost a century for Virakesari to emerge. 
Although Eelakesari also started in the same 
year, it did not become a national newspaper. 
Until then, there were no significant 
newspapers to counter the attacks launched by 
the Sinhalese press.
The following list will give you an idea of the 
number of Sinhalese newspapers published 
during this period.7 Among these, a significant 
number were nationalist newspapers that, over 
time, began to deny or oppose the aspirations 
of non-Sinhalese Buddhist communities. 
In this context, there was no strong Tamil 
newspaper in Colombo to respond to these 
actions.
In such a situation, there were many reasons 
and justifications for Arunachalam and the

Tamil Maha Sabha's attempt to start a 
Tamil newspaper. However, this effort 
did not come to fruition. Following 
Arunachalam's death, this attempt was 
abandoned. Just as the Tamil Maha Sabha 
dwindled and faded away after him, so too 
did this newspaper initiative disappear 
into thin air.
Although Arunachalam established the 
Tamil Maha Sabha as a movement for the 
entire island of Sri Lanka, it was mainly 
the Tamils from the North who showed 
significant interest in it. However, its 
inaugural meeting took place in Colombo, 
and similarly, the newspaper was also 
planned to be published from Colombo. 
The plan was to publish it in both English 
and Tamil.
This clearly indicates that the initiative 
was aimed at raising awareness among 
the Tamil community in Tamil while also 
addressing the Sinhalese and English-
speaking powers in English. If it had 
materialized, it could have provided a 
valuable platform for dialogue between 
the two sides from the very beginning, 
fostering political clarity and enabling 
meaningful exchanges between 
communities. Such a platform might 
have even mitigated or resolved certain 
conflicts. Had this effort succeeded from 
the start, it is possible that the ethnic issue 
might not have escalated into a 'national 
problem' as it did later on.

plaque at the entrance bearing the name ‘Bella 
Villa’ and replaced it with a new one bearing 
the name of his wife, ‘Rāṇi Mahāl.’ Aṉṉarāṇi 
was thirty-three then, now seventy-one. 
Mariyanāyagam was four years older than her.
The entrance to Rāṇi Mahāl had four tall 
decorative steps. Only after she climbed 
the steps and approached the front door did 
Aṉṉarāṇi remember that she did not have the 
house key with her. She never had the house 
key. Her husband always carried it, which 
was now inside the pocket of his overcoat. 
Exhausted, Aṉṉarāṇi squatted down on the 
front step. After a minute of respite, she got 
up and left in search of the key.
Now she walked a little faster along the 
riverside footpath. The festive lights strung 
along the riverbank blended with the light of 
dawn setting up a dazzling light show on the 
waters of the Seine. The woods start where 
the footpath ends. Walking trails snaked 
through the protected woods. People usually 
came here after six for their morning walks. 
But Mariyanāyagam came here every day at 
half past four in the morning for his pre-dawn 
walk.
Aṉṉarāṇi entered the woods and walked 
forward along the trail. The first rays of the 
sun peeped through the dense foliage. She 
walked towards the wooden bench where 
Mariyanāyagam always paused for a rest 
break half-way through his walk. His lifeless 
body lay on the trail before the bench.
Blood had congealed on Mariyanāyagam’s 
face, head, and hands. His eyeglasses lay on 
the ground, broken right through the middle 
into two pieces. The middle of his forehead 
had been cracked open, and something that 
looked like yellow egg yolk had been oozing 
out disgustingly. Aṉṉarāṇi shut her eyes as 
soon as she saw this. Then she turned her 
head upwards towards the sun’s rays and knelt 
beside her husband. She felt around gently 
in the red overcoat he was wearing. As soon 
as her fingers felt the bunch of keys stuffed 
into one of its pockets, she picked up the key 
bunch and started walk back towards Rāṇi 
Mahāl.
Now she found it difficult to climb the four 
steps. She climbed the stairs slowly, pausing 
on each step. The bunch of keys in her hand 
had ten or fifteen keys, confusing her as to 
which was the key to the front door. She tried 
them one by one, slowly. Eventually the sixth 
or seventh key opened the door.
She entered the house, turned the lights on, 
went into the bathroom, stripped, and washed 
her hands and feet. She then went into the 
bedroom, opened the closet, took out a blue 
sāri and put it on. Mariyanāyagam did not 
like her wearing sāris. He insisted that she 
wore European clothes. She knotted her hair 
into a bun, applied moisturizing cream to her 
face and arms, and wore her black winter 
jacket over her saree. After locking the front 
door and securing the keys in her handbag, 
she climbed down the stairs to the street and 
started walking.
Bus traffic on this street started only after 
seven in the morning. It was now deserted 
and quiet. Only the corner bakery was 
open. As she passed the bakery, she was 
momentarily confused whether to turn left or 
right. She paused for a moment to collect her 
thoughts and concluded that her son’s house 
was towards the right. She turned right and 
continued walking.
Aṉṉarāṇi’s son Philip’s house was about a 
kilometer away, at the center of the village. 
The path towards his house kept lengthening 
as she walked. She started to doubt if she 
could in fact reach her son’s house. The only 
thing she remembered clearly was that her 
son’s house was in the green building between 
the fire station and the McDonald’s.

From time to time, she paused to lean against 
a wall to catch her breath. Her feet were 
freezing. She tutted at herself for the folly 
of venturing out without wearing socks. By 
the time she identified her son’s house and 
pressed the buzzer, it was already seven 
o’clock.
Philip opened the door, still half asleep, and 
gaped at her. “Mummy, why at this time… 
you could have called me…”
Aṉṉarāṇi hugged her son, kissed him on both 
cheeks, and sat down on the large armchair in 
the living room.
“Mummy… did Papa come with you? He 
would never let you go out alone …”
Aṉṉarāṇi nodded and looked around, asking, 
“Where is Rosa, son?”
Philip rubbed his eyes and dawned. “She has

night duty,” he said and looked at the wall 
clock, “she will be here in half an hour.”
“OK, you go back to sleep. I will sit here.”
Philip scratched his head and went back 
into the bedroom. Although Philip acted 
sluggishly, he was very sharp. He received 
accolades at school and university as a top 
student. Aṉṉarāṇi’s elder son Kennedy was 
just the opposite. He would not stay put in 
one place. He did not excel in studies either. 
Unlike her second son Philip, Kennedy was 
not born in France. He was born in Sri Lanka 
and came to France, along with Aṉṉarāṇi, 
when he was six.
Aṉṉarāṇi leaned back further. She felt very 
sleepy. But she was determined not to fall 
asleep. She kept one ear open for the ringtone 
of Philip’s home phone or mobile phone, 
and the other ear towards the front door. She 
closed her eyes gently. Kennedy called out 
to her, ‘ammā;’ He cried out in grief, “Papa.” 
Aṉṉarāṇi sank deeper into the armchair.
2
Aṉṉarāṇi was twenty-six when she got 
married, which was somewhat later than was 
typical. It was unusual in 1975 for a young 
woman to remain unmarried until twenty-six. 
The entire village would join in the effort of 
finding a match for such a woman.
The deacon at the St. Anthony’s church, 
Iṉṉāsimuttu and his wife Aruḷammā had 
two children. Thiyōgu, the older boy, died 
by drowning in the sea as he was traveling 
by boat for the Pālaitīvu church festival. 
Aṉṉarāṇi was three years younger than him.
Aṉṉarāṇi was tall like a coconut palm. She 
had a full physique to match her height. 
She was blessed with a sort of lemony 
complexion. It took forever to comb her thick, 
curly hair. People said that this village had 
never before seen such beauty or modesty. For 
the girls growing up in every household in the 
village, Aṉṉarāṇi was held up as the exemplar.
Aṉṉarāṇi studied till grade eight in the village 
school. To study beyond that, one needed to 
go elsewhere. At that time, the village custom 
was not to send young girls outside the village 
alone. Aṉṉarāṇi did not ask to continue her 
education either. She was not particularly 
interested in studying. Reading a book gave 
her a headache. Her interest was in cooking 
and eating different types of delicious food. 
She would scour their yard in search of fruit 
trees like amla, guava, jambu, and mango. 
She was always chewing on something. If she 
sat down to eat boiled palmyra sprouts, she 
would not get up until she had eaten twenty. 
When the palmyra fruit season began, she 
would roast and eat a palmyra fruit every day.
Aṉṉarāṇi left the house only on Tuesdays 
to go to church services on Tuesdays to St. 
Anthony’s church and Sundays to St. John’s 
church. She always wore a long skirt that 
came down to her ankles, and long-sleeved 
tops. A white veil with a black lace border 
covered her head, as she tagged behind her 
parents to church with her head always down.
The days when she used to gossip for 
hours by the fence with girls her age from 
neighboring houses had come to an end. 
All the neighborhood girls were married. 
They no longer had time to gossip. Even on 
those rare occasions when she chatted with a 
neighborhood girl across a fence, Aṉṉarāṇi 
immediately ran away into the house if she 
spotted the girl’s husband come that way.
Iṉṉāsimuttu family were landowners. Their 
holdings spanned gardens, wells, and fields. 
They had no shortage of wealth. Nevertheless, 
a groom for Aṉṉarāṇi was not found until she 
was twenty-six. Even those rowdy Romeos 
who habitually chased after the young 
women of the village did not dare linger near

Aṉṉarāṇi’s house. The talk 
among the village boys 
was that Aṉṉarāṇi was 
unapproachable for them. 
Her mother Aruḷammā 
worried that it was 
Aṉṉarāṇi’s height that kept 
her from finding a match. 
“Aṉṉam was born with 
the likeness of the Dutch, 
something unheard of in 
our entire lineage,” she 
said.
Aṉṉarāṇi liked skipping. 
That was the time when 
shops didn’t carry special 
skipping ropes. Village 
girls would cut ordinary 
fence rope to size and twist 
two rope stands together 
to construct a skipping 
rope. Back then it was a 
girls-only pastime. One 
day, when Aṉṉarāṇi was 
skipping in the front yard, 
kicking up a cloud of dust, 
Iḷavālai māmi opened the 
front gate and walked in.
Iḷavālai māmi was 
Iṉṉāsimuttu’s first cousin. 
Whenever she showed up at 
Iṉṉāsimuttu’s house, there 
was always an underlying 
reason---pawning some 
jewelry, barter, church 
business, and so on. This 
time she brought along 
a marriage proposal for 
Aṉṉarāṇi.
“Kōdhāri Thuraiyappā’s 
eldest, they are in fact 
related to you through 
Uncle Joachim. A graduate 
of the University of Peradeniya. Works at a foreign firm in 
Colombo. He is unlike his father. No drinking, chewing betel 
leaves, or smoking cigarettes. Everything you own is for 
your little girl, right? Why don’t you give her this house and 
land as dowry. The boy has two sisters. You have to give ten 
thousand each as donation and twenty-five thousand as cash 
in Kōdhāriyār’s hands. I know you will give at least thirty 
sovereigns of gold jewelry to your daughter.”
Mariyanāyagam and his relatives hired a cab from Iḷavālai to 
come to see the potential bride. Aṉṉarāṇi was seated on a chair 
in the middle of the living room. She sat there majestically 
like royalty. Her mother thought that Mariyanāyagam stood 
an inch shorter than Aṉṉarāṇi. When Iṉṉāsimuttu popped into 
the kitchen, she whispered to him, “Short or tall, let us get her 
married off, without nitpicking. We cannot go on keeping her as 
a spinster at home.”
The village had never seen such a grandiose wedding before. 
The celebration lasted three whole days. On the first day, the 
entire village prepared for the wedding. At six in the morning, 
two loudspeakers facing east, and west were installed on the

palmyra tree in the front yard, and they 
began blaring 'Ask, and it shall be given 
you' as the first song. The bishop was related 
to Mariyanāyagam. Therefore, the bishop 
himself came directly to the church to officiate 
at Mariyanāyagam’s and Aṉṉarāṇi’s wedding.
After the wedding, Mariyanāyagam moved 
into Aṉṉarāṇi’s house which was now in 
his name. Aṉṉarāṇi’s parents showered 
Mariyanāyagam with respect. The respect 
only grew with each passing day because 
Mariyanāyagam was related to the bishop.
After work on Friday evenings, 
Mariyanāyagam boarded the train at Colombo 
to arrive at Aṉṉarāṇi’s house early in the 
morning on Saturdays. On Sunday evenings, 
he boarded the train back to Colombo.
As a Colombo resident, Mariyanāyagam 
stood out in the village. He was the one who 
introduced toothpaste and toothbrushes to 
Aṉṉarāṇi’s household. Iṉṉāsimuttu was, in 
fact, proud to watch his son-in-law brushing 
his teeth in the mornings, toothpaste foaming 
in his mouth, while Aruḷammā focused 
intently on brewing egg coffee for her son-in-
law.
Mariyanāyagam went for walks along the 
village beach every morning and evening. 
People in the village usually went to the 
beach only to defecate. Therefore, it is 
understandable that the village folk looked on 
with suspicion as Mariyanāyagam wandered 
under the cover of screw pine bushes along 
the beach. “The deacon’s son-in-law is 
weird,” they whispered among themselves. 
Even Aṉṉarāṇi’s family could not understand 
Mariyanāyagam’s ways. What was the point 
of wandering about the beach every morning 
and evening for no apparent reason?
There was another problem. Mariyanāyagam 
insisted that Aṉṉarāṇi accompany him on 
those walks. Aṉṉarāṇi did not like it one 
bit. The act of stepping out of the house 
disgusted her. She preferred her freedom 
within the house compared to being forced 
to walk outside with her head bowed down. 
Once when she was walking along the beach 
with Mariyanāyagam, she thought she heard 
someone heckle them from behind the screw 
pine bushes. Mariyanāyagam kept on walking 
nonchalantly. Aṉṉarāṇi could not help turning 
to look behind her a thousand times.
Mariyanāyagam liked to go into Jaffna town 
to watch movies. He only watched English 
movies. He compelled Aṉṉarāṇi to go with 
him. There were no women in movie theaters 
showing English movies. Aṉṉarāṇi would be 
the sole woman in the entire theater. When 
scantily clad figures appear on the screen, 
sometimes even completely naked ones, 
Aṉṉarāṇi’s entire body will start to shiver. 
She felt that all the eyes in the theater were 
on her. But Mariyanāyagam would be totally 
engrossed in the movie. As they returned 
home Mariyanāyagam would talk to her about 
the movie. On those occasions, Aṉṉarāṇi, too, 
could not help thinking ‘he is weird.’
Within three months of marriage Aṉṉarāṇi 
conceived Kennedy. After six months, 
Mariyanāyagam announced that he would 
be going abroad. His employer was sending 
him to Finland for further studies. He left for 
Finland saying that it was a two-year program 
and that he would come home on vacation 
once every six months. He never returned.
For the first six months, Aṉṉarāṇi received 
letters from him regularly. Thereafter, that, 
too, ceased. With an infant in her arms, 
Aṉṉarāṇi was distressed. Mariyanāyagam’s 
parents had not receive any letters either. A 
year later, finally, a letter arrived from France.
It seemed that Finland did not agree with 
Mariyanāyagam. He said he could not stand

the solitary living in the 
cold northern latitudes, 
and therefore had moved 
on to France where he had 
friends. He was going to 
start a business in France 
with friends and would 
arrange for Aṉṉarāṇi to 
join him in France. He 
also wrote a few words 
inquiring about the health 
of baby Kennedy.
Aṉṉarāṇi’s nervousness on 
being invited to join him 
in France surpassed her 
happiness of hearing from 
her husband after such 
a long gap. Iṉṉāsimuttu 
asked her to keep the news 
secret. He said that if the 
villagers learned that his 
daughter and grandchild 
were going abroad, their 
evil eye might disrupt their 
travel plans.
But Mariyanāyagam did 
not send for Aṉṉarāṇi right 
away. Although he sent 
letters and money regularly, 
it did not look as if he was 
taking any efforts to get her 
to France. Aṉṉarāṇi did not 
ask for it either. By now, 
she had started skipping 
with Kennedy. They arrived 
in France only when 
Kennedy was six.
3
At that time, they lived 
in an apartment block in 
Paris. Mariyanāyagam 
was running a cleaning 
business. Twenty-five 
Tamils worked for him. 
Business was brisk. He 
had got contracts from exhibition halls and marketplaces. In 
his leisure, he socialized, taking Aṉṉarāṇi and his son to visit 
friends or having friends over.
Now Mariyanāyagam was drinking heavily. There was not a 
day when he did not drink. Aṉṉarāṇi was not concerned about 
his drinking. In fact, she liked it when she smelled alcohol on 
him in their bed. Iṉṉāsimuttu, too, drank toddy every morning 
and evening. When Aṉṉarāṇi was little, sometimes he gave her 
a little toddy in a coconut shell. "Palmyra toddy is good for 
the health, child,” he said. Aṉṉarāṇi liked the sour sweetness 
of palmyra toddy. Until she grew up, she occasionally drank a 
coconut shell worth of toddy.
But Aṉṉarāṇi could not accept Mariyanāyagam’s insistence on 
taking her and her child when he visited friends. She detested 
having to dress up for visits or being forced to welcome 
visitors with a forced smile. Similarly, she did not want to 
visit the homes of Mariyanāyagam’s friends. At the time, 
Mariyanāyagam was the only married man in his circle of 
friends. In those gatherings, Aṉṉarāṇi struggled, being the lone 
female with a six-year-old in tow.

Mariyanāyagam kept nagging Aṉṉarāṇi to 
always freshen up, put on makeup, and wear 
nice clothes. If Aṉṉarāṇi was slow to do this, 
he scolded her, calling her “islander,” which 
is a mild derogatory term for people from the 
Jaffna archipelago. But he did not show any 
interest in his son, Kennedy. The child showed 
no attachment to him either. Mariyanāyagam 
fumed at the child far more often than he 
did at Aṉṉarāṇi. Kennedy was an active 
child. He was scolded often by his father. 
Mariyanāyagam refused to have another child. 
Squeezing her breasts, he would tell Aṉṉarāṇi, 
“Another child will hurt your body, Aṉṉam.”
Mariyanāyagam was immensely proud of 
his successful cleaning business and his 
luxury car. Aṉṉarāṇi thought he was also 
keen to show off his wife to the world with 
pride. Two years after she arrived in France, 
Mariyanāyagam bought Rāṇi Mahāl. 
Now that they were in the suburbs at some 
distance from the center of Paris, Aṉṉarāṇi 
was looking forward to some peace and 
quiet, and solitude. But from time to time, 
Mariyanāyagam would suddenly decide to 
take Aṉṉarāṇi and their son to visit friends, 
or friends would visit Rāṇi Mahāl. A drunken 
revelry with music and singing would ensue. 
Aṉṉarāṇi could not bear these raucous parties. 
Even when Aṉṉarāṇi’s parents died one after 
the other, Mariyanāyagam did not agree to let 
her visit their village. “Now the fighting in Sri 
Lanka is severe,” he declared.
Mariyanāyagam never hit his wife. But he did 
not know how to talk to her without insulting 
her. As her youth and beauty waned with the 
years, these insults and sarcastic remarks 
were on the increase. Mariyanāyagam even 
ridiculed the child, Kennedy. But whenever 
he went to a party or event, he always 
took Aṉṉarāṇi with him. He did not even 
agree to let her go shopping by herself. He 
hired an African nanny to take the child to 
school and back. Without Mariyanāyagam, 
Aṉṉarāṇi could not even go to church for 
Sunday service, or for Easter or Christmas. 
If Mariyanāyagam happened to be busy 
with work, then there would be no mass for 
Aṉṉarāṇi that Sunday.
Rāṇi Mahāl gradually transmogrified into 
a full-time interrogation chamber. Her ears 
were scorched by the scathing words of his 
incessant scolding. Once he gets drunk late at 
night, he would invent a reason to scold his 
wife and child non-stop: that her demeanor 
was not right, or that she did not respect him 
enough, or that the child was not doing well at 
school. He would sit on a chair in the middle 
of Rāṇi Mahāl’s expansive living room and 
demand, “Seek forgiveness, Aṉṉam.”
When she was a little girl, Aṉṉarāṇi had seen 
once or twice her mother Aruḷammā seeking 
forgiveness from her father Iṉṉāsimuttu. But 
Mariyanāyagam demanded that she seek 
forgiveness every day.
Aṉṉarāṇi was supposed to stand on the side 
of the chair that Mariyanāyagam was sitting 
in, confess to her sins, and seek forgiveness. 
During those times, Aṉṉarāṇi struggled to 
find sins or faults that she could confess to. 
Mariyanāyagam expected her to confess to 
new sins every day. When Aṉṉarāṇi could 
not come up with suitable sins to confess to, 
Mariyanāyagam would push the mother and 
son out of Rāṇi Mahāl and shut all doors.
Countless were the nights when the mother 
and child sat shivering on the decorative front 
steps. Mariyanāyagam would open the door 
again only at half past four in the morning, 
when he was ready to go for his daily morning 
walk. Aṉṉarāṇi would take the child inside, 
put him on his bed, and join Mariyanāyagam 
on his walk. Mariyanāyagam never went for a 
walk without Aṉṉarāṇi.

As soon as the sun went down, Aṉṉarāṇi 
would hide two woolen blankets and two 
water bottles under the decorative front steps. 
When they were thrown out of the house, she 
would cover herself and her child with those 
blankets and try to rock the child to sleep on 
her lap.
When the father was not home, the child 
Kennedy would go stand next to the high-
backed chair in the middle of the living room. 
Then he would go outside and sit on the 
front steps. Sometimes he would go missing. 
Aṉṉarāṇi would search in room after room to 
finally find him.
Kennedy died just three days shy of his 
fourteenth birthday. That night, when 
Mariyanāyagam was scolding Aṉṉarāṇi softly 
and asked her to seek forgiveness, Kennedy 
ran away to hide somewhere. Mariyanāyagam 
searched the entire house but failed to find 
Kennedy. Blind with anger, Mariyanāyagam 
pushed Aṉṉarāṇi out of Rāṇi Mahāl and shut 
the door. Aṉṉarāṇi sat on the front step with 
her ears open. Mariyanāyagam opened the

door at three in the morning. When Aṉṉarāṇi 
rushed inside, she found Kennedy’s lifeless 
body on a skipping rope hanging from the 
roof tie beam in the kitchen.
“What sin did he commit to hang himself?” 
asked Mariyanāyagam as he hit his forehead 
with his palm.
After Kennedy’s death Mariyanāyagam 
mellowed down a little. The police 
interrogated Mariyanāyagam and Aṉṉarāṇi 
thoroughly. Kennedy did leave enough tell-
tale signs in the kitchen that he died by 
suicide.
The very next year, Mariyanāyagam got 
Aṉṉarāṇi pregnant again. He completely 
stopped the practice of demanding that she 
seeks forgiveness or throwing her out of the 
house at night. Mariyanāyagam was fond of 
the second child, Philip. When the twenty-
year old Philip brought a French girl Rosa 
to Rāṇi Mahāl and introduced her as his 
girlfriend, Mariyanāyagam was all smiles. He 
welcomed her and kissed her on her cheeks. 
He took Aṉṉarāṇi with him to visit Rosa’s 
parents at their home.
Occasionally Rosa would stop by at Rāṇi 
Mahāl to pick up Philip. At those times, 
Mariyanāyagam was visibly happy and 
chatted incessantly with her in French. 
Aṉṉarāṇi would stop at serving Rosa 
something to eat or drink. Aṉṉarāṇi did not 
know enough French to chat with Rosa. Rosa 
was not the gregarious type either. She did 
not talk much but would stay put like a doll 
wearing a slight smile.
Two years ago, Philip moved into Rosa’s 
apartment. Thereafter, she came by Rāṇi 
Mahāl just two or three times. After Philip 
moved out of Rāṇi Mahāl, the huge house was 
still with silence. Mariyanāyagam had retired. 
He would go out to visit friends occasionally. 
Even then Aṉṉarāṇi would have to correctly 
make herself up to accompany him.
Once Aṉṉarāṇi gently asked Mariyanāyagam 
if they could now sleep in separate rooms. 
Aṉṉarāṇi was hoping that at seventy years 
of age, the solitude she was longing for 
was within reach. But Mariyanāyagam did 
not agree. Even at seventy-five, he never 
went to bed without Aṉṉarāṇi next to him. 
He never went out without her either. If 
Aṉṉarāṇi hesitated, he berated and insulted 
her. Aṉṉarāṇi was certain that even when 
Mariyanāyagam died, he would take her with 
him.
4
Minutes after Philip went back to his room 
to resume his sleep, Aṉṉarāṇi heard his upset 
and confused voice from where she was 
sitting. Holding his cellphone in his left hand, 
with consternation on his face, Philip walked 
softly to her, and hugged her right shoulder. 
His voice faltering, he said:
“Mummy, you should not be upset. I got a 
message… I am not sure if it is true. The 
police just called me… they found Papa 
dead…” Unable to continue, he covered his 
mouth and started to weep. His tears fell on 
Aṉṉarāṇi’s face. Aṉṉarāṇi stroked his hand 
and said:
“Philip.. You calm down a little. Let Rosa 
come.”
“No Mummy. The Police have asked me to 
come right away.. I told them I would bring 
you along.. Get up slowly so that we can go..”
Aṉṉarāṇi said, “We can go Philip… sit on that 
chair for a few moments. Let Rosa come,” 
and leaned back further into her chair and 
closed her eyes.
This morning at half past four, 
Mariyanāyagam left for his morning walk,

taking Aṉṉarāṇi as usual. Nowadays 
they rarely talked. Even if they did, 
Mariyanāyagam did the talking. His every 
word only served to tar Aṉṉarāṇi with insults.
After doing a round in the woods, they sat 
down on their usual bench. Mariyanāyagam 
had planted his walking stick on the ground, 
holding it with both his hands. He curved his 
back to lean on the walking stick, putting half 
his weight on it. He had bought that walking 
stick just last week in an antique market. It 
was carved from strong wood and adorned 
with a silver rim on its handle and a bronze 
ferrule. Mariyanāyagam murmured softly 
so that Aṉṉarāṇi could hear him, “We have 
to visit Rāsēndram this evening.. It is his 
seventieth birthday.. He would be offended if 
we didn’t visit.”
Aṉṉarāṇi murmured in response:
“I don’t feel well.. I am not coming.”
“Why what is wrong with you? Do you have 
an itch in your private parts?”
Aṉṉarāṇi did not respond. She stared at a 
distance, with folded hands. These kinds of 
barbs did not anger her. But the shame was 
eating into her for years. Once tall like a 
coconut tree, this 'islander' now had wrinkled 
skin, a bent back, and sagging flesh. She 
looked as frayed and damaged as a goatskin 
painting from a puppet show.
Mariyanāyagam was quiet and motionless for 
a while. Then shouting something in French, 
she lifted his walking stick and threw it away. 
Spittle splattered from his mouth. He stood 
up slowly and pointed to the walking stick 
with his index finger. He removed his glasses, 
wiped them on his chest, put them back on 
again, and glared at Aṉṉarāṇi. She walked 
up to the walking stick, picked it up, and 
was returning to hand it back to her husband. 
Mariyanāyagam muttered:
“Why don’t you, too, hang like your elder 
son?”
Walking stick in her hand, Aṉṉarāṇi froze 
when she heard this. She felt the blood 
circulation within her forty-five-kilogram 
body come to a standstill. Her hands became 
rigid. Her legs moved forward. Eyes wide, 
looking at Mariyanāyagam’s face, she swung 
the walking stick and hit him on his face. The 
eyeglasses cracked with a pop. “What sin did 
I commit? Why are you hitting me?” asked 
Mariyanāyagam calmly.
Holding his forehead with his left hand, he 
extended his right hand to try to wrest the 
walking stick away from Aṉṉarāṇi. She 
swung the walking stick again and hit his 
hand. When Mariyanāyagam tried to say 
something, she hit him again on his head.
Stroking her shoulder, Philip said “Mummy.. I 
will go see what this is about.. Papa’s body is 
in the woods, it seems.”
“Philip, you can’t go now… when Rosa 
returns, you have to translate what I say into 
French for her!”
“What do you want to say Mummy… tell me, 
won’t you..”
She stroked Philip’s hand that was on her 
shoulder. She leaned back on the chair and 
said:
“No son… you would not understand!”
The sound of footsteps came from outside the 
front entrance. The mother and the son looked 
at the clock on the wall.
