Yes, we were there to advise him, but the 
problem was that he refused to listen. He 
couldn't discern who was giving sound 
advice and who was leading him astray. 
Instead of taking counsel from those who 
truly understood the political landscape, he 
surrounded himself with so-called pseudo-
intellectuals who either had vested interests or 
lacked political acumen.
These individuals had no real political 
experience or connection to the general 
public. They lived in their own isolated 
worlds, detached from the realities faced 
by ordinary people. It was this same group 
who advised Gotabaya to cremate the bodies 
of Muslim COVID-19 victims despite our 
warnings. We explained that this was a deeply 
religious issue and that ignoring it could turn 
the entire society against us. But he chose 
to disregard our counsel and followed the 
recommendations of this insular group of 
intellectuals, who later appeared on stages to 
oust him.
In your view, what does this reveal 
about Gotabaya Rajapaksa's 
personality?
I believe that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 
was an incredibly effective Defence Secretary, 
and his success stemmed from operating in an 
environment where he could make decisions 
independently. He had the full backing of his 
brother, then-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, 
and together, they executed decisions with 
remarkable efficiency. However, when 
Gotabaya became President, he mistakenly 
believed that intellectuals should guide him in 
everything.
While these intellectuals may excel in their 
academic fields, they lack practical experience 
in dealing with the everyday issues that affect 
the people. They live in academic bubbles, 
far removed from the realities of the public, 
and this disconnect led to poor advice and, 
ultimately, disastrous decisions.
Could you name some of these 
intellectuals who misguided Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa?
I'd rather not name anyone specifically.
Do you think that if Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa had relied less on these 
intellectuals and more on his instincts, 
he could have been a successful 
President?
No single person can run a country alone; it's 
impossible. Any leader who tries to operate 
in isolation is destined to fail. Gotabaya 
had a political party deeply connected 
with the people, one that had evolved from 
grassroots movements. He should have relied 
on his party for political decisions, as the 
presidency is inherently a political position. 
Any political decision must be grounded 
in the party's ideology and supported by its 
base. Unfortunately, in my opinion, President 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa lacked a coherent political 
ideology, and that was one of his greatest 
downfalls.
He didn't even listen to his brother, 
Mahinda Rajapaksa?

No, not at all. That was one of the major issues.
Why was that? Did he become 
arrogant?
He did exhibit a certain level of arrogance, but 
the situation is more complex than that. At his 
core, Gotabaya is a simple and straightforward 
gentleman. He was always willing to listen 
to those around himâ€”he would consider 
different perspectives and take them into 
account. His intentions for the country were 
genuinely good. However, in the end, he 
consistently deferred to the advice of a small 
group of intellectuals who had gained his trust.
He believed in them implicitly, almost 
as if they were delivering gospel truths. 
Unfortunately, this misplaced trust often led 
him astray. A leader should listen to a wide 
range of diverse opinions and then decide on 
the best course of action.
How did these intellectuals manage to gain so 
much respect and influence with him?
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was an efficient 
manager during his tenure as Defence 
Secretary, particularly during the war. When
