F
or the second consecutive day, as of August 
30th, when this issue went to press, the 
legal community in Mannar has continued its 
boycott of court proceedings in response to 
defamatory posters anonymously posted in 
Colombo, targeting the Mannar High Court 
judge. The lawyers, united in their protest, are 
demanding the swift apprehension of those 
responsible, asserting that this act threatens 
the very integrity of the judiciary.
Led by Senior Attorney Emmanuel Caius 
Feldano, President of the Mannar Bar 
Association, the lawyers convened today in 
front of the Mannar High Court to express 
their unequivocal condemnation of the recent 
defamatory posters targeting the presiding 
judge. The ongoing boycott has effectively 
brought all scheduled court proceedings to a 
halt, with cases being postponed until further 
notice.
Addressing the media during the protest, 
Emmanuel Caius Feldano highlighted the 
gravity of the situation, stating, "Twelve 
years ago, approximately 52 individuals were 
arrested in connection with the attack on the 
Mannar High Court. This case, which has been 
meticulously investigated over the past decade, 
reached its final stage recently. However, on 
the eve of this crucial trial, defamatory posters 
featuring the image of the Mannar High 
Court judge surfaced in Colombo, containing 
derogatory statements in Sinhala".

The timing of these posters has heightened 
tensions, with the legal community expressing 
deep concern over what they perceive as an 
attempt to intimidate or influence the judicial 
process. The Mannar Bar Association has 
made it clear that they will not stand by while 
the judiciary's integrity is threatened.
"This trial has been conducted with the 
utmost adherence to due process, yet these 
actions targeting the Mannar High Court 
judge are utterly unacceptable," Caius Feldano 
asserted. "Our boycott of court proceedings is 
a direct response to this affront, and we will 
persist in our protest until those responsible 
are apprehended and brought to justice. 
We call upon the authorities to act swiftly 
and decisively to protect the dignity of the 
judiciary and ensure that such acts do not go 
unpunished," he added.
This boycott has its roots in a long-standing 
case that has gripped the Mannar region for 
over a decade. The case dates back to 2012 
when Muslim fishermen who had been 
displaced during the war and relocated to 
Puttalam returned to their homes near the 
coastal region of Konthaipitti in Mannar. Their 
demand for the full return of the Konthaipitti 
fishing zone led to a series of legal disputes 
with Tamil fishermen, who were subsequently 
allotted an alternative area by the Mannar 
High Court.
However, this solution did not go uncontested, 
as another Muslim fisherman claimed 
ownership of the newly allotted area and 
sought a court injunction to prevent the Tamil 
fishermen from engaging in fishing activities 
there. The ensuing legal battles have been 
marked by significant tensions and protests, 
including an attack on the Mannar High Court 
12 years ago.
As the case finally reached its concluding 
phase, the emergence of defamatory posters 
against the judge has reignited tensions and 
drawn widespread condemnation. The legal 
community in Mannar remains resolute in 
their demand for justice, making it clear that 
they will not relent until the perpetrators are 
held accountable.
The outcome of this situation is likely to have 
far-reaching implications for the ongoing case 
and the broader legal landscape in the region.
