auff Hakeem, leader of the Sri Lanka 
Muslim Congress, has expressed 
concerns that the initiative to field a Tamil 
common candidate in the forthcoming 
presidential election could undermine 
the autonomy aspirations of the Tamil 
community. He further observed that 
even those initially supporting the Tamil 
common candidate might eventually shift 
their allegiance to Sajith Premadasa, the 
presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana 
Balawegaya (SJB).
Addressing an election campaign rally 
supporting Sajith Premadasa, Hakeem 
elaborated on the Tamil National 
Alliance's (TNA) cautious approach. "The 
TNA has always taken its time when making 
decisions regarding the presidential election. 
They are known for their deep thinking, and 
we respect that. We've allowed them the space 
to deliberate and decide," Hakeem remarked.
Hakeem also commented on the recent move 
by certain groups to independently field a 
Tamil common candidate. "I asked those 
supporting this candidate why there was a 
need for a separate candidate. Their response 
was that some individuals are troublemakers, 
compelling them to take this step. However, 
they also assured me that they would 
ultimately support Sajith. Prominent leaders 
mentioned this to me, though I prefer not to 
name them," Hakeem disclosed.
He cautioned against the potential 
consequences of this move for Tamil 
aspirations. "This will weaken the autonomy 
demands of the Tamil people. It's crucial 
that the Tamil community does not become 
entangled in this strategy."
Hakeem emphasized the significance of the 
presidential election as a pivotal moment for 
the Tamil community to engage with national 
leaders. "The presidential election is one of the 
rare occasions when national leaders come 
to you. It is vital to make the most of this 
opportunity. Sajith Premadasa is a leader who 
stands against racism," Hakeem concluded.
