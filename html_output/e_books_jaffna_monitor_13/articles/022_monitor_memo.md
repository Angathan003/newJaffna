T
he upcoming presidential election is 
shaping up to be more of an escape 
room challenge than a political contest, 
at least for those Tamil Members of 
Parliament who've tied themselves to the 
common Tamil candidate. But it seems 
Vino Noharathalingam, the crafty MP 
from the Vanni District and a key figure in 
the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization 
(TELO), has already found the exit. While 
his party, led by Selvam Adaikalanathan, 
has pledged its loyalty to the common 
Tamil candidate, Vino has pulled off a 
Houdini-like escape, sidestepping the 
sinking ship with the finesse of a seasoned 
escapologist.

Speaking to 
the media 
after an event 
in Vavuniya, 
Noharathalingam 
made his 
position crystal 
clear. "There is 
no change in 
the decision I 
made earlier. 
While my party, 
TELO, may have 
taken a different 
path, my stance 
remains firm. I will not be campaigning 
in support of the common Tamil 
candidate. It's not just me; there are 
others within the party who share this 
sentiment."
Noharathalingam didn't mince words 
in expressing his disagreement with his 
party's decision. "Regardless of whether 
the party's decision is right or wrong, I 
do not personally align with it. I don't 
believe this is a choice that reflects 
the will of the people or one that truly 
resonates with them."
Looking ahead to the election results, 
Noharathalingam predicted a significant 
setback for the common Tamil 
candidate. "Once the results are in, it 
will become clear that this election 
has served as a wake-up call. It will 
undoubtedly push those involved to 
rethink their positions and adapt their 
methods moving forward," he stated 
confidently.
Without directly naming them, 
Noharathalingam subtly alluded to the 
three main candidates already etched 
into the public 
consciousness: 
Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, 
Sajith Premadasa, 
and Anura 
Kumara 
Dissanayake. He 
expressed hope 
that the Tamil 
people would 
make a wise 
and informed 
decision, 
pledging to 
respect the choice made by the majority. 
"I will act in accordance with the 
decision made by the majority of Tamil 
people," he affirmed.
Noharathalingam also disclosed that, 
despite the ongoing election, he has 
had several meetings with President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe, with a focus on 
the development of his constituency. 
These discussions, he noted, primarily 
centred on the allocation of funds for 
development projects in the Vanni 
District.
Amidst swirling rumours that a few 
TNA MPs are quietly backing Ranil 
Wickremesinghe in the presidential 
election—regardless of their party's 
official stance—Noharathalingam has 
made a clear break from the common 
Tamil candidate. Adding to the intrigue, 
State Minister Suren Raghavan recently 
revealed that three Tamil Members 
of Parliament from the Northern 
and Eastern provinces have already 
pledged their support to President 
Wickremesinghe, stirring the political 
pot even further.
