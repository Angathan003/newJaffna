ndian National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit 
K. Doval, the first NSA to be accorded the 
personal rank of a Cabinet Minister, touched 
down in Colombo on August 29, continuing 
his active role in the Colombo Security 
Conclave initiative. Doval, known as one of 
Prime Minister Modi's most powerful and 
trusted advisors, wields significant influence 
over India's national security and foreign 
affairs. That same day, he engaged in pivotal 
discussions with representatives of Tamil 
political parties. The meeting unfolded at the 
Indian House in Colombo, setting the stage 
for what many consider a crucial dialogue 
between Doval and Tamil nationalist leaders.
According to credible sources who spoke to 
Jaffna Monitor, the meeting involved in-depth 
discussions on various critical issues, including 
the common Tamil candidate proposed by 
some Tamil parties and the election boycott 
advocated by the Tamil National People's Front 
(TNPF).
The sources further elaborated that during the 
meeting, Ajit Doval clarified that, as a foreign 
representative, he would refrain from advising 
Tamil political parties on their strategy for 
the upcoming presidential election. However, 
he reportedly emphasized the importance of 
unity and suggested that Tamil votes should 
be utilized in a way that would yield the most 
constructive outcomes—a strategy that many 
Tamil parties seem to overlook in favour of 
their own divisive agendas.
Invitations were extended to a selected group 
of Tamil political leaders, including Ilankai 
Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) figures Mavai 
Senathirajah, MPs Sivagnanam Sritharan, and 
M.A. Sumanthiran; Tamil Eelam Liberation 
Organization (TELO) leader and MP Selvam 
Adaikalanathan; and People's Liberation 
Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) leader, 
MP Dharmalingam Siddarthan. Also on the 
list were Selvarasa Kajendran, the General

Secretary of the Tamil National People's Front (TNPF) 
and MP, along with C.V. Wigneswaran, the leader of 
the Tamil People's Alliance and MP.
According to credible sources, while Sritharan, 
Sumanthiran, Selvam Adaikalanathan, and Kajendran 
attended the meeting, Meanwhile, Siddarthan, C.V. 
Wigneswaran, and Mavai Senathirajah chose to 
remain in Jaffna, their absence at the meeting sparking 
speculation about their motives.
Sources report that ITAK MP Sritharan did attend 
the meeting, but due to a slight delay, he couldn't stay 
for the entire session as his flight to London was on 
schedule. He managed to participate for about ten to 
fifteen minutes before informing Ajit Doval that it was 
time for him to catch his flight. Sritharan then headed 
directly from the Indian House to the airport.
Before departing, Sritharan reportedly shared his 
thoughts, expressing that after exhausting every 
avenue to resolve the ethnic issue without success, 
he and others, driven by frustration, had decided to 
field a common Tamil candidate. Ajit Doval, with his 
years of experience in national security, reportedly 
listened with his usual calm. After all, as a seasoned 
NSA, Doval is no stranger to hearing explanations that 
are more about personal agendas cleverly disguised as 
genuine grievances and solutions.
Sources reveal that during the discussion, MP 
Kajendran conveyed to Ajit Doval that the past 75 
years since independence have made it painfully 
evident that the Tamil people cannot thrive under 
Sri Lanka's unitary state. He stressed that the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution had been a complete 
failure, offering no viable path for Tamil progress.
Sources reveal that Gajendran declared his party's firm 
rejection of both the 13th Amendment and the 2015 
constitutional draft, both of which uphold a unitary 
state system. He passionately urged India to support 
the creation of a federal system that would grant the 
Tamil people in the Northern and Eastern provinces 
the right to self-determination. This, he asserted, is the 
driving force behind their decision 
to boycott the upcoming presidential 
election—an election they believe 
offers no meaningful change for their 
people.
However, what Gajendran 
conveniently omitted was why his 
party's inspiration, the LTTE, and 
its leader, Prabhakaran, outright 
dismissed the idea of a federal system 
and brutally silenced numerous 
individuals who advocated for it. It's 
a glaring contradiction that wasn't 
brought up in the conversation with 
Doval, leaving one to wonder about 
the selective memory at play.

and aspirations of local Tamils. As one critic aptly 
remarked, "It's almost as if TNPF's compass is guided 
more by the flow of dollars than by the actual needs on 
the ground."
After Sritharan departed mid-meeting for his flight to 
London, only Sumanthiran, Selvam Adaikalanathan, 
and Gajendran remained in the room. Sources 
reveal that Ajit Doval did bring up the decision of 
a few parties to field a common Tamil candidate, 
but Selvam Adaikalanathan, the TELO leader and 
supposed champion of this idea, seemed more 
interested in discussing the issue of Indian fishermen 
encroachment. He didn't utter a word about the 
common Tamil candidate, which only adds fuel to the 
speculation that as the election draws closer, his party 
might be leaning towards supporting President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe.
Sources reveal that Sumanthiran outlined how ITAK 
is meticulously evaluating the stances of the three 
main presidential contenders. He emphasized that 
ITAK will announce its position to the Tamil people 
once the most suitable candidate has been identified. 
Interestingly, Sumanthiran also disclosed that the 
party has already sought explanations and initiated 
disciplinary action against Ariyanethiran, an ITAK 
Executive Committee Member who put himself 
forward as the common Tamil candidate.
Sources report that Ajit Doval, after inquiring about 
the differing stances and voting dynamics among the 
Tamil people, advised that the best course of action 
would be for everyone to unite and strategically use 
Tamil votes in the upcoming presidential election. 
While he refrained from dictating what decisions the 
Tamil parties should make, Doval emphasized the 
importance of carefully considering how the votes cast 
could impact democracy and ultimately benefit the 
Tamil community. If that advice was indeed given, it 
served as a much-needed schooling for our so-called 
Tamil leaders, who often seem more engrossed in 
political theatrics laced with their own agendas while 
their people continue to suffer.
Moreover, Gajendran also neglected 
to mention that the boycott decision 
isn't purely driven by principle—it's 
heavily influenced by the financial 
backing his party receives from the 
diaspora. Critics are quick to point 
out that his party often aligns more 
with the agenda of a troublesome 
segment of the diaspora, who seem 
intent on keeping the North and East 
of Sri Lanka in turmoil to justify their 
fundraising efforts abroad rather than 
genuinely representing the needs

ormer Justice C.V. Wigneswaran, leader 
of the Tamil People's Alliance, has pointed 
the finger squarely at a single individual 
within the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi 
(ITAK), holding him solely responsible for its 
current unfortunate state. While Wigneswaran 
refrained from naming this person, political 
observers believe it's none other than 
Sumanthiran- who, interestingly enough, was 
once his student.
During a recent press conference in Jaffna, 
Wigneswaran responded to a reporter's 
inquiry about rumours that some members 
are planning to break away from ITAK to 
form a new party. With a smirk, Wigneswaran 
remarked, "The once-strong Sri Lankan Tamil 
political party is now in a pitiable state thanks 
to one person. He's the reason the party has 
been pushed to the brink of breaking apart. I,

too, left the party because of him. 
So, if others decide to jump ship, it 
shouldn't come as a surprise."
Wigneswaran also took the 
opportunity to clarify that his party 
has not withdrawn its support 
for the common Tamil candidate, 
dismissing such claims as false. "Our 
party continues to offer its support. 
I've been out of the spotlight recently 
due to health issues, but that doesn't 
mean we've stepped back from our 
commitments. Since the deposit for 
the common candidate was paid, 
we've been actively involved in the 
campaign."
He didn't shy away from addressing the 
current political landscape, particularly his 
take on President Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
Wigneswaran revealed his long-standing 
familiarity with Wickremesinghe, stating, "I've 
known President Ranil Wickremesinghe for 
many years. However, in politics, there are no 
permanent friends or enemies. While we had 
hoped for action on the devolution of powers 
under the 13th Amendment, the President has 
done nothing but disappoint us over the past 
year. It's now clear that mere talk is all we can 
expect from him—there's no real intention to 
deliver a solution for the Tamil people."
He also touched on the broader political 
dynamics, noting the internal divisions 
within ITAK, particularly the differences 
between members like Mavai Senathirajah 
and Shritharan, who continue to support 
the common candidate, and others like 
Sumanthiran and Shanakiyan, who seem to 
be aligning with Sinhala candidates, possibly 
even moving towards supporting Ranil 
Wickremesinghe. "It's a betrayal of the Tamil 
cause," Wigneswaran hinted.
Furthermore, Wigneswaran commented on 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake, suggesting that 
while his potential victory could see corrupt 
politicians jailed, there are doubts about his 
ability to steer the country economically, 
especially if he leans on Chinese support. 
"Economic progress under his leadership is 
uncertain, and his Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist 
tendencies make him a questionable ally for 
our people."
In a final jab, Wigneswaran alluded to the 
growing dissatisfaction within ITAK, hinting 
at the potential for a new faction to emerge. "It 
wouldn't be surprising if some members break 
away to form a new party. After all, it's largely 
due to one individual that the party finds itself 
in this sorry state."
Wigneswaran's remarks have undoubtedly 
stirred the pot, casting a spotlight on the 
internal strife within ITAK and the broader 
Tamil political landscape as the presidential 
election approaches.
