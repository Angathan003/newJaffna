n a significant development for air travel 
between India and Sri Lanka, Indigo Airlines 
has announced the launch of a new daily flight 
service between Chennai and Jaffna, beginning 
today, September 1st. This marks the airline's 
entry into the Jaffna market, providing an 
additional option for travellers between the 
two cities.
The introduction of Indigo's daily service 
boosts the existing connectivity, which is 
currently provided by Alliance Air, an Indian 
airline that also operates daily flights to Jaffna. 
The competition between the two airlines is 
expected to benefit passengers by offering 
greater flexibility and choice.
Further enhancing connectivity, there are 
reports that Jaffna International Airport is set 
to undergo upgrades to meet international 
standards, potentially paving the way for more 
airlines and routes in the future.
Another notable development is the passenger 
ferry service between Nagapattinam and 
Kankesanthurai, which has also recently 
resumed, offering yet another travel option 
between India and Sri Lanka.
