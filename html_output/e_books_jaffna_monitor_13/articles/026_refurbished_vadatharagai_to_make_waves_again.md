A 
budget of 50 million rupees has been 
allocated for the refurbishment of 
the ‘Vadatharagai’ passenger boat, with 
its return to service expected within six 
months, as announced at the District 
Secretariat recently.
Originally acquired in 2017 for 150 
million rupees under the North East 
Local Services Improvement Project 
(NELSIP) for the Provincial Council, 
the vessel was intended to facilitate 
transportation between Kurikattuwan 
and Neduntheevu. After several years in 
operation, the boat required repairs in 
2023 and was subsequently handed over 
to the Navy for restoration.
The ‘Vadatharagai’ was transported to the 
Trincomalee Naval Base for the necessary 
refurbishment. On February 20, 2024, the 
Northern Provincial Department of Local 
Government transferred 51.481 million 
rupees to the Navy’s account via check to 
cover the repair expenses.
With the refurbishment now complete, 
the ‘Vadatharagai’ is set to resume 
operations. During the recent District 
Development Coordinating Committee 
meeting at the Jaffna District Secretariat, 
the successful restoration and the boat’s 
imminent return to service were officially 
announced by I. Ilangovan, Chief 
Secretary of the Northern Provincial 
Council.
