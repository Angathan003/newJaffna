Can you shed light on a few of the 
atrocities committed by the JVP that 
you witnessed firsthand?
Oh my God, the memories are truly 
harrowing. I've witnessed countless beheaded 
bodies mercilessly killed by the JVP. People 
were hanged from lampposts in grotesque 
displays of their reign of terror. Some were 
shot, and their grieving families were denied 
even the basic dignity of a proper funeral. 
The JVP ordered their relatives to discard the 
bodies in the jungles, where they were left to 
be devoured by wild animals.
In comparison, who do you believe 
was more cruel, the LTTE or the JVP?
I believe both were equally cruel. I have 
witnessed firsthand the horrors inflicted by 
the LTTE. I saw how they mercilessly killed 
innocent civilians—Sinhala, Muslim, and 
Tamil alike—massacring entire communities. 
Some of the most chilling experiences were in 
Monaragala and Batticaloa, where the LTTE 
slaughtered entire villages. They didn't just kill; 
they butchered people in cold blood.
Are you certain that these extremist 
elements were the driving force behind 
the Aragalaya movement?
While there were genuinely affected members 
of the public who participated in the protests, 
extremist elements sought to achieve their 
political objectives by exploiting these masses. 
This became evident when they attempted to 
attack the Parliament. Fortunately, the majority 
of genuinely affected individuals recognized 
that this was a step too far and resisted the call. 
As a result, the plan failed, and to this day, you 
can still hear some JVP members lamenting 
over it.
You've played a significant role in 
getting Gotabaya Rajapaksa elected as 
the President of Sri Lanka in the last 
presidential election. In your opinion, 
why did things go so wrong during his 
presidency?
To put it bluntly, he was completely 
inexperienced as a politician. When you're 
the leader of a country, you have to manage 
a multitude of people with conflicting 
interests—a talent that only comes with 
experience. Even a CEO must be adept at 
navigating internal politics; it's not just about 
running operations smoothly. His lack of real 
political experience became glaringly obvious 
once he took office, leaving him vulnerable 
to exploitation by various parties. Though he 
genuinely had the best interests of our country 
at heart, he simply couldn't deliver.
But weren't you and others there to 
advise him? Shouldn't that have helped 
mitigate his inexperience?
"Provincial Councils are essential for 
development, and as a former Chief Minister, I 
believe they should be given even more power 
to serve the people effectively."
