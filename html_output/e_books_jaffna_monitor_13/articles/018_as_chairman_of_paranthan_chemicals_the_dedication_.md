What specific changes do you believe 
are necessary for Provincial Councils 
to function more effectively?
There needs to be a reliable system in place to 
ensure that funds are appropriately allocated 
from the central government's budget to the 
Provincial Councils. It should be mandatory 
for the government to allocate a certain 
percentage of the budget to these councils.
Can you give an example of how the 
current system of fund allocation is 
unfair?
Take, for instance, the Western Province—
thanks to the Colombo Port and the Colombo 
Municipal Council, it's financially self-
sufficient. They don't need additional funds 
from the central government because their 
income streams are substantial. On the other 
hand, provinces like the Southern, Eastern, 
or Uva are among the poorest. The central 
government has sometimes allocated funds 
equally across provinces, which is unjust. It 
should be an equitable distribution of funds, 
taking into account the development needs, 
the population, poverty levels, etc. Not an 
equal distribution.
What factors should be considered 
when allocating funds to the 
provinces?
After some persistent advocacy, the 
government began considering population 
numbers for allocation. But it's not just 
about population—it's about the landscape, 
infrastructure, poverty, development needs, 
resources, etc. There are areas with no 
population because there are no roads to 
support settlements. The roads, schools, 
hospitals need to be built first; only then will 
people settle. The current system for allocating 
funds is far from practical. Too much money is 
funnelled into Colombo (Western Province), 
which already has all the facilities and revenue 
systems in place, while the other provinces 
are left struggling. This imbalance needs to be 
addressed for the Provincial Councils to truly 
serve their purpose.
What is the maximum power-sharing 
that you have, in principle, accepted 
for the Tamil community?
I believe that Provincial Councils should 
be granted full autonomy over their own 
development projects—not just the Northern 
Provincial Council, but all councils across the 
country. However, there must be coordination 
between the provinces and the central 
government to ensure consistency, alignment 
with national priorities, and practicality.
So, you support granting land and 
police powers to the provincial 
governments?
Land powers, yes—that's perfectly fine, and

there's no harm in it as long as there is proper 
coordination. For example, one province can't 
build a road that ends at the border of another 
province without connecting the intended 
cities because one province refuses access. But 
police powers? That's a different story. If police 
powers had been offered to me when I was 
the Chief Minister of the Southern Province, I 
would have refused them.
Security and the maintenance of law and 
order must be a central function. The 
provinces should not be burdened with that 
responsibility. However, if undue influence 
or corruption interferes with provincial 
administration, the provinces should have the 
authority to lodge a complaint with the central 
government and seek swift redress.
