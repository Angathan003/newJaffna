What is your personal estimation of 
Prabhakaran?
Prabhakaran was an overestimated man. If I 
had been in his shoes when the opportunity 
arose to share power and form a government, 
I would have seized it. Former President 
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga 
offered Prabhakaran a chance to establish 
a government and govern the region in an 
exemplary manner. If I were him, I would have 
taken that opportunity without hesitation.
President Chandrika Bandaranaike 
Kumaratunga even stated that she was 
prepared to hand over power after a decade. 
But Prabhakaran didn't listen. He missed 
the chance to establish his government, his 
policies, and his ideology in that region.
That's why I say he was overestimated. Instead 
of choosing the path of compromise and 
building something sustainable, he chose 
conflict. In doing so, he sacrificed not only 
himself but everyone who believed in him. He 
led many to their deaths, including his own 
family. In the end, he became a big zero.
How do you see Sri Lanka without the 
LTTE? For nearly 30 years, your life 
revolved around the LTTE. How do you 
view the last 15 years without them?
The peace we enjoy now is our most significant 
achievement, and it has paved the way for 
substantial development. Areas that once 
had no road access and no bridges—have 
mostly been built. People are embracing new 
opportunities for growth. However, the Tamil 
leadership should have been more proactive 
in supporting and driving the development of 
their regions.
Take C.V. Wigneswaran, for example. When 
he was the Chief Minister of the Northern 
Province, he returned a substantial amount 
of money—around 600 crores, if I recall 
correctly—that his council had received from 
the central government for development. 
What a foolish and irresponsible decision! 
As a former Chief Minister of the Southern 
Province, I was outraged by his negligence. 
We constantly struggled to secure funds from 
the central government, and here he was, 
sending money back! This kind of behavior 
is typical of hardline Tamil politicians who 
refuse to develop Tamil-majority areas because 
they want to keep playing their dirty political 
games.
Why? If the area remains underdeveloped, 
these politicians can continue to manipulate 
people through their divisive politics. They 
don't want development because, if it takes 
place, Tamil grievances will be addressed 
more effectively, leading to closer ties with 
the government and the Sinhala and Muslim 
communities. And that's precisely what these 
so-called hardline Tamil politicians want to 
avoid. They thrive on division, not unity.

"President Ranil Wickremesinghe was open to running 
with SLPP support, but he preferred to contest as an 
independent candidate to attract broader support."
