It's not right for me to give my opinion, as it 
may influence others. However, we should 
think very carefully, consider where the 
country currently stands, and choose the best 
person who can lead the country forward.
How did it happen that Namal was 
suddenly announced as the SLPP's 
presidential candidate? Who was 
behind that decision?
Namal likely made that decision with the 
support of others in the Central Committee.
But he had the backing of his father, 
uncles, and others, didn't he?
Ultimately, when Namal decided to step 
forward, it was difficult for his father or uncles 
to refuse. Family dynamics are complex, and in 
the end, they stood behind him.
Was Ranil Wickremesinghe ever 
willing to contest under the SLPP 
banner?
At one point, I believe he was open to the 
ideaâ€”not as the official SLPP candidate 
but as an independent candidate with SLPP 
support. From the beginning, President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe expressed his preference 
to run as an independent. He believed that 
running under an independent label would 
enable him to garner broader support, both 
within and outside the party.
What's the reason behind the majority 
of SLPP members rallying behind Ranil 
Wickremesinghe? Is it because of the 
benefits they get from aligning with the 
President, or do they genuinely want to 
support him?
No, I don't think it's about benefits. The 
situation is far more complex than that. 
Consider the circumstances when President 
Ranil Wickremesinghe took over amidst 
the chaos of the Aragalaya protests. SLPP 
parliamentarian Amarakeerthi Athukorala was 
brutally beaten to death, and they were actively 
hunting down other SLPP parliamentarians as 
well.
A total of 84 houses belonging to SLPP 
members of Parliament were burnt to the 
ground. Out of 116 SLPP parliamentarians, 84 
lost their homes entirely. The SLPP members 
were deeply traumatized and didn't even feel 
safe moving freely in public.
President Ranil Wickremesinghe restored 
normalcy and has brought the economy 
to where it is today. The majority of SLPP 
members support him for that reason and 
believe there is no one better suited to lead 
the country through these difficult times than 
Ranil Wickremesinghe.
So it's not about political advantages?
