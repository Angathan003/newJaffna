Running the country peacefully and without 
turmoil is, in itself, a significant advantage for 
the SLPP. Let's not forget that this is still an 
SLPP government, now led by President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, with SLPP members holding 
the majority in Parliament.
If you can, sir, answer me in one 
word—though I know, as the Speaker, 
you can't openly endorse any 
candidate in the presidential race. But 
who would you prefer to be the next 
President?
Whoever leads the country must be capable 
of governing it peacefully and effectively, 
especially during a crisis of this magnitude.
Then what will happen to the SLPP? In 
his interview with the Jaffna Monitor, 
Foreign Minister Ali Sabry mentioned 
that SLPP members who support Ranil 
are forming a new party.
Yes, they have no other choice now. Since the 
party announced that they are suspending 
those who support President Ranil 
Wickramasinghe, forming a new party has 
become their only option.
How do you view the decision to sack 
SLPP members who are supporting 
Ranil?
Initially, the party was leaning towards not 
fielding a candidate and instead supporting 
President Ranil Wickremesinghe. But then, out 
of the blue, they decided to field MP Namal 
Rajapaksa as their presidential candidate. By 
that time, many SLPP MPs and ministers had 
already thrown their support behind President 
Wickremesinghe, making it impossible for 
them to backtrack. The decision to sack 
members came from those who hadn't even 
stepped forward earlier to announce, 'We're 
fielding a candidate.' By that point, most of our 
people had already distanced themselves from 
the party.
Now, the party has made the mistake of 
alienating those who support President 
Ranil Wickramasinghe. I asked the party's 
General Secretary, Sagara Kariyawasam, 
'If you chase away everyone in the party 
who supports Ranil, who will be left in the 
SLPP? Can you really run a political party 
like this?' I even gave him an example from 
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's era when 
he expelled Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith 
Athulathmudali—two leaders who brought 
a million votes to the party. When they were 
sacked, the UNP lost the next election, and 
to this day, the UNP hasn't fully regained its 
footing.
Political parties should never expel people 
lightly. Once you cut ties, you can't engage 
with them anymore. They're forced to seek 
refuge elsewhere—either in another party, 
by forming their own, or by leaving politics 
"My opposition to the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord wasn't 
about devolution or the 13th Amendment; it was about 
rejecting the presence of a foreign army on Sri Lankan 
soil, which I saw as a violation of our sovereignty."
