D
ilith Jayaweera, one of Sri Lanka's most prominent 
billionaires, media moguls, and successful 
entrepreneurs, and the president of the Mawbima 
Janatha Party has officially entered the presidential race 
as the candidate of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance—a 
coalition often characterized as an alliance of Sinhala 
hardliners. In a move that surprised many, Jayaweera, 
along with his coalition of seven parties—including 
the Mawbima Janatha Party led by Jayaweera himself, 
the National Freedom Front led by MP Wimal 
Weerawansa, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya led by MP Udaya 
Gammanpila, the Democratic Left Front led by MP 
Vasudewa Nanayakkara, the Communist Party led by 
G. Weerasinghe, the Yuthukama National Organisation 
led by MP Gevindu Kumaratunga, and the collective 
of Independent MPs represented by MP Channa 
Jayasumana—chose to launch his election campaign in 
the heart of Sri Lankan Tamil culture: Jaffna.

During the visit, Dilith Jayaweera, along with Udaya 
Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa, paid a visit to 
the historic Nallur Temple in Jaffna, accompanied by 
Arun Siddharth, the Mawbima Janatha Party's Jaffna 
organizer. Siddharth, who has a controversial history 
with the Nallur Temple, added an intriguing layer 
to the visit. However, the bare-chested photos of the 
group in the temple vicinity quickly went viral on 
social media, sparking a meme frenzy.
Jayaweera's candidacy has attracted significant 
attention because of his pivotal role in Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa's 2019 presidential campaign, where his 
strategic media influence played a crucial part. We 
sat down with him in Jaffna to gain insights into his 
decision to enter the presidential race. Here are some 
excerpts from our conversation.
What motivated you to enter this 
presidential race?
The people of Sri Lanka have resoundingly articulated 
their demand for change—they've battled relentlessly 
for it. After enduring decades of stagnation with the 
same faces entrenched in Parliament, they're no longer 
content with empty promises. There is nothing truly 
innovative among all the candidates except for me. 
The other contenders have wielded power before, yet 
they have failed to deliver the transformation our 
nation desperately needs. We're here to offer exactly 
that—a meticulously crafted plan designed to usher in 
meaningful, positive change for everyone.
Do you regret playing a key role in 
bringing Gotabaya Rajapaksa to 
power?
There are indeed certain decisions I profoundly regret. 
Chief among them was my failure to foresee the 
overwhelming influence of the Rajapaksa family over 
him, an influence that ultimately led to his downfall. 
I never anticipated that the family would wield such 
control, stifling his ability to execute his own vision. 
This was a significant misjudgment on my part, one I 
regret deeply.
In hindsight, it's clear how naive I was to believe he 
could navigate his role independently of his family's 
grip. That was my error. The harsh truth is that it was 
the family who orchestrated his downfall because he 
dared to diverge from their corrupt and self-serving 
path. When I speak of the family, I include Namal 
Dilith Jayaweera, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila, Anuradha Yahampath, and others in front of Nallur Kandaswamy 
Temple in Jaffna

Rajapaksa, SLPP's current presidential candidate, in 
that assessment.
There are accusations from both 
the Tamil and Sinhala people that 
your alliance is bringing together 
Sinhala hardliners in support of your 
candidacy. How do you respond to 
this?
This is where the misunderstanding lies. Who exactly 
are these so-called Sinhala hardliners? Am I one of 
them? I am one of the most moderate people you'll 
meet, deeply rooted in the principles of Buddhism.
Buddhism teaches that one's worth is not determined 
by birth. As the Buddha said, "Not by birth is one a 
Brahmin or an outcast; by deeds is one a Brahmin, 
by deeds is one an outcast." I believe in this principle 
wholeheartedly, rejecting all forms of discrimination.
So, how can I be labelled a Sinhala hardliner? We are 
all human beings, and I believe Sri Lanka can rise 
above divisions and live in harmony. Guided by the 
principles of Buddhism, we are in a unique position to 
move forward together.
Are you a strong Buddhist simply 
because you were born into it?
No, not at all. Until I was about 16, I actually identified 
as a communist. My father was a communist, so I was 
influenced by those ideas. However, I wasn't truly an 
atheist because I was raised in a traditional Buddhist 
village environment. As I grew older, I became 
more of a nationalist, with my beliefs being strongly 
influenced by Buddhism. My journey to becoming a 
stronger Buddhist was a gradual process shaped by 
my experiences and evolving beliefs, not merely by the 
circumstances of my birth.
Why did you start your campaign in 
Jaffna, a place considered the heart of 
Sri Lankan Tamils?
It's crucial to make one thing clear: certain 
international parties seem intent on dividing this 
country along ethnic lines, which I strongly oppose. 
This divisive mindset is completely at odds with 
the philosophy of Buddhism, which rejects division 
based on caste, religion, ethnicity, or creed. If anyone 
attempts to divide us in such a way, I consider it 
profoundly unjust. You can distinguish us by height, 
weight, or wealth—those are superficial differences—
but creating divisions based on the notion that some 
people are inherently superior due to their birth is 
something I cannot accept.
We chose to launch our campaign in Jaffna and stand 
alongside Arun Siddharth, our party's Jaffna organizer, 
because he genuinely believes in equality and has 
been a staunch opponent of the caste system. I want to

convey to the Tamil community—though I dislike the 
term "minority" as it implies division—that you are not 
a minority. We are all equal, part of one united nation.
I was genuinely pleased with how the campaign went. 
The warmth and affection I received from the people 
were truly heartening. It confirmed that starting our 
campaign in Jaffna was indeed the right decision.
If you don't see Tamils as a minority, 
how do you view them?
I see Tamils as an integral part of Sri Lanka's soul, 
woven into the very fabric of our national identity. 
When I visited the Nallur Temple, I felt a deep 
connection, as if it was very much a part of me. There 
was no sense of division or difference. Isn't that a 
beautiful feeling? This is the message I want to share—
that we are all connected, part of the same whole, and 
that our strength as a nation lies in this unity.
Do you have any issues with the Tamil 
community?
Absolutely not. How could I possibly have a problem 
with Tamils? My concern is not with the Tamil 
community but with extremists—regardless of their 
ethnicity.
One of the core teachings of the Buddha is 
compassion. Without compassion, you cannot truly 
call yourself a Buddhist. Being born into Buddhism 
is not enough; you must live by its principles. As 
someone who firmly believes in Buddhism, if I don't 
have compassion for every single being—regardless 
of their ethnicity—then I am not living up to the true 
essence of Buddhism.
In this context, how could I possibly have an issue with 
Tamils? Compassion is central to my beliefs, and it 
guides my interactions with everyone. My focus is on 
fostering understanding and unity, not division. That's 
why I reject extremism in all its forms and why I am 
committed to building bridges between communities, 
not walls.
Will your decision to kickstart the 
election campaign in Jaffna resonate 
well with the Sinhala community?
Absolutely. The Sinhala community is incredibly 
open-minded and embracing. We are free thinkers 
with a liberal approach to life, deeply influenced by the 
inclusive philosophy of Buddhism, which encourages 
justice, compassion, and understanding. There are 
no restrictions on doing what is right and good, 
and reaching out to all corners of our nation aligns 
perfectly with these values.
The divisions we observe today are largely vestiges of 
historical interventions, particularly those orchestrated 
by Western colonial powers intent on creating deep 
fissures between the North and South, Tamils and 
Sinhalese, Hindus and Buddhists. Regrettably, there 
are still calculated efforts to perpetuate these divisions, 
using modern tools and tactics to manipulate and 
fracture our communities for ulterior motives.
But we have overcome this. Within our association, 
Tamils feel entirely at ease and deeply integrated. You 
can speak to them directly—they will affirm how 
comfortable and secure they are within our unified 
movement. When I visited Jaffna, I felt no sense of 
insecurity or threat; instead, I encountered warmth 
and a profound sense of unity.

That said, I have observed that some Tamil politicians 
exhibit racist tendencies. In the spirit of national unity 
and reconciliation, I won't name them—some are 
even my friends. It's important to note that this racism 
doesn't stem from genuine belief but is often a facade 
for their political gain. For example, certain Tamil 
MPs who were born and raised in Colombo, educated 
alongside diverse communities, travel to Jaffna to 
propagate divisive rhetoric. They utilize this form of 
political racism not out of true conviction but as a tool 
for ugly politics, aiming to stir emotions and secure 
votes by exploiting historical wounds.
By starting our campaign in Jaffna, we wanted to 
demonstrate our commitment to inclusivity and 
show that we stand against all forms of divisiveness, 
whether they come from external forces or internal 
politics. Our goal is to build a Sri Lanka where every 
community feels valued, respected, and integral to the 
nation's fabric.
How confident are you about winning?
I'm very confident. At this moment, 40% of the 
electorate is still undecided—that's a significant 
portion of the vote. I recently spoke with some tuition 
masters, and they mentioned that when they asked 
their students, who are first-time voters, about their 
voting intentions, most of them said they haven't 
decided yet. I'm working hard to secure those 
undecided votes.
Your shirtless photos at the Nallur 
Temple went viral. What are your 
thoughts on that?
Those were some of the happiest moments of my 
life, and they sent a very powerful message. Udaya 
Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa have been 
unfairly labelled as racists, but I've always maintained 
that they are not. They accompanied me to the 
temple, and I believe those photos have helped shift 
the narrative. The images conveyed a strong message 
of unity and respect for all cultures. It was a moment 
of connection rather than division, and I'm glad it 
resonated with so many people.
