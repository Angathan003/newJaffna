S
un Jin, known internationally as Florence 
Sun, is the editor-in-chief of Shenzhen 
Daily and Eye Shenzhen, two of China's 
prominent English-language publications. 
With a background in English Language and 
Literature from Nanjing University and an 
International MBA from Peking University, 
Sun Jin brings a wealth of experience to the 
forefront of English-language journalism 
in China. Her career has included key 
roles at CGTN and Shenzhen Special Zone 
Daily, where she has played an active role in 
documenting Shenzhen's rapid transformation 
and its emergence as a global economic hub.
In this exclusive interview with Jaffna Monitor, 
Sun Jin reflects on the policies and strategies 
behind Shenzhen’s evolution, its role in China’s 
broader urbanization efforts, and what cities 
like Jaffna can learn from its successes.
According to you, what key decisions 
and strategies were instrumental in 
driving this remarkable growth and 
fostering innovation?
This success can be largely attributed to 
foresighted policies and the establishment of 
the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ). 
Within the SEZ framework, several pivotal 
decisions and strategies have driven the city's 
rapid growth and relentless innovation.
One of the foundational decisions was the 
introduction of the "Special Economic 
Zone" concept. In 1979, the Chinese 
central government decided to implement 
special policies and flexible measures in the 
Guangdong and Fujian provinces, granting 
these regions greater autonomy. Shenzhen, 
alongside Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen, 
was selected as a pilot city for the SEZ 
initiative, marking the official launch of this 
transformative policy.
The cornerstone of Shenzhen's transformation 
lies in Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening-
up policy, which emphasized economic 
restructuring and the attraction of foreign 
investment. The SEZ framework created a 
unique environment for experimenting with 
new economic policies and management 
systems, fostering unprecedented growth.
In my view, while policy played a crucial 
role in Shenzhen's development, what 
truly set it apart was its relentless focus 
on innovation, particularly in technology 
research and development. The city made 
significant investments in education, research 
institutions, and innovation infrastructure, 
cultivating an urban culture of creativity and 
entrepreneurship.
Shenzhen's SEZ experiment introduced special 
tax incentives to attract foreign investment and 
granted companies greater independence from 
the central government in international trade. 
Market-driven growth spurred the production 
of export-oriented commodities, catapulting 
the city onto the global stage.
The city's development was built on four 
pillar industries: advanced technology, robust 
finance, efficient logistics, and a vibrant 
entrepreneurial culture. Today, Shenzhen 
is home to some of the world's leading 
information and communication technology 
giants, including Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, and 
DJI, the global leader in drone technology.
As industrialization progressed, Guangdong 
began transitioning into a post-industrial 
society, evolving into an advanced

manufacturing and global innovation hub. In 
this grand vision, Shenzhen plays a pivotal role 
as a global center for high-tech innovation, 
venture capital, and social media.
Shenzhen is often highlighted as the 
quintessential example of China's 
1980s approach to urbanization, 
which intertwined with the broader 
strategy of opening up the economy. 
Could you elaborate on the defining 
characteristics of this approach 
and why Shenzhen became the 
ideal canvas for this transformative 
experiment?
Shenzhen is perhaps the most vivid reflection 
of China's urbanization over the past few 
decades. Shenzhen's rise was intricately linked 
to the nation's broader economic opening-up 
policy. The defining features of this approach 
and the reasons why Shenzhen became the 
perfect testing ground for such an ambitious 
urbanization experiment can be explored as 
follows:
1. Rapid Urbanization:
Shenzhen underwent extremely rapid 
urbanization, transforming from a small 
town with a population of just over 20,000 
to a major city within a short period. This 
rapid transformation was fueled by significant 
investment, infrastructure development, and 
population growth.
2. Economic Opening-Up:
Shenzhen's urbanization was closely linked 
to China's economic opening-up policy. As a 
special economic zone, Shenzhen benefited 
from preferential policies that attracted foreign 
investment, technology, and management 
expertise.
3. Market-Oriented Reforms:
Shenzhen served as a testing ground for 
various market-oriented reforms, such as the 
reform of the investment system, labor market 
reforms, and price deregulation. These reforms

helped to create a more dynamic and efficient 
economy.
4. Infrastructure Development:
Significant investment was made in the city's 
infrastructure, including roads, bridges, public 
transportation, and utilities. 
Shenzhen became an ideal canvas for 
development due to several factors, including 
its geographical location, policy support, 
immigrant culture, and entrepreneurial spirit. 
These elements combined to make Shenzhen 
a successful model for urbanization in China 
and beyond.
Until recently, industrial transformation and 
innovation were driven by Shenzhen, with 
strong support from Guangdong and the Pearl 
River Delta region. 
The region entered a new phase with the 
launch of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-
Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) blueprint 
in February 2018. The GBA connects nine 
cities in Guangdong, including Shenzhen, 
Guangzhou, and Dongguan, along with the 
special administrative regions of Hong Kong 
and Macao. This initiative aims to integrate 
these metropolises into a cohesive economic 
powerhouse, much like San Francisco's Silicon 
Valley in its global influence and innovation. 
With a population of approximately 125 
million, the GBA fosters collaboration in 
technology, finance, and infrastructure, 
positioning Shenzhen as a critical hub within 
this dynamic network. Additionally, I want to 
elaborate on one particular aspect: Shenzhen's 
urban culture, which emphasizes passion, 
diversity, and tolerance. Nearly every young 
individual who comes to Shenzhen arrives 
with a dream—to pursue their career goals, 
achieve financial success, or follow their loved 
ones. They are highly motivated and often put 
in much more effort than their peers back in 
their hometowns.
The slogan, "Once you come here, you are 
already a Shenzhener," perfectly exemplifies 
the city's tolerant and welcoming culture. This 
mindset has also played a significant role in 
Shenzhen's success.
 
As Shenzhen rapidly expanded, 
what urban planning strategies were 
implemented to handle population 
growth while maintaining its status 
as a livable city? How does the city 
balance infrastructure development 
with quality of life?
Shenzhen has implemented comprehensive 
planning and zoning regulations to ensure 
orderly urban development. These regulations 
govern the allocation of land for various uses, 
including residential, commercial, industrial, 
and green spaces, promoting a balanced and 
sustainable urban environment.
Public transportation-oriented development 
(TOD) is also a key priority in the city, 
encompassing subways, buses, and bike-
sharing systems. By integrating transportation 
and land-use planning, Shenzhen has created 
more livable and accessible communities.
Known as "A City of Thousands of Parks," 
Shenzhen is often described as a mountain-sea 
tapestry for its extensive green infrastructure. 
The city has invested significantly in green 
initiatives, including parks, green corridors, 
and urban gardens. These green spaces 
enhance air quality, offer recreational 
opportunities, and contribute to the city's 
overall livability.
I would like to reference renowned architect

Pablo Laguarda from New York City, who was 
previously featured in an exclusive interview 
with us. He observed some remnants of 
poorly coordinated planning and construction 
projects in Shenzhen. Reflecting on its past, he 
remarked that 20 years ago, Shenzhen was still 
a city "devoid of any urban character, cultural 
venues, and public spaces. 
"We had heard much about Shenzhen's 
incredible high-rise buildings and skyscrapers 
and their contribution to the city's modern, 
even futuristic, appearance," Pablo and his 
colleague John noted. 
However, what truly exemplifies Shenzhen's 
transformation into a first-tier international 
city is its commitment to promoting public-
friendly and environmentally conscious 
projects. Green corridors and sustainable 
initiatives are now given priority, showcasing 
the city's forward-thinking vision.
Balancing infrastructure development with 
quality of life involves several key elements:
1. Affordable Housing Policies: Shenzhen has 
implemented measures to ensure an adequate 
supply of high-quality, affordable housing for 
both renting and purchasing. These policies 
aim to address the housing needs of various 
income groups and promote social stability.
2. Efficient Public Services: The city has 
heavily invested in expanding and enhancing 
public services, including education, 
healthcare, and public safety. By ensuring these

services are efficient and accessible, Shenzhen 
has maintained a high quality of life for its 
residents, even amidst rapid urban growth.
3. Community Engagement: Shenzhen 
actively encourages community involvement 
in urban planning and development. By 
including residents in the decision-making 
process, the city has fostered more inclusive 
and responsive urban environments.
4. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 
Shenzhen has embraced sustainable urban 
development principles, such as energy 
efficiency, water conservation, and waste 
reduction. These initiatives help mitigate the 
environmental impact of urbanization and 
pave the way for a more sustainable future.
Shenzhen is frequently described as 
mainland China's answer to Hong 
Kong, given its rapid development 
and global influence. In what ways 
has Shenzhen mirrored Hong Kong's 
success, and how has it distinguished 
itself as a unique entity in China's 
broader urban and economic strategy? 
How has this impacted migration 
patterns, especially the decline in 
Chinese youths moving to Hong Kong?
 
Shenzhen and Hong Kong are often compared 
for their high levels of economic freedom and 
rapid development. Shenzhen's early growth 
was significantly influenced by its proximity to 
Hong Kong, benefiting from both capital and 
the relocation of industries from Hong Kong. 
With limited space for expansion, Hong Kong 
transferred lower value-added industries to 
the Pearl River Delta, enabling it to focus on 
its core strengths in finance, education, and 
other service sectors. This strategy aligns with 
sound economic development principles and 
represents a natural progression; in this regard, 
Shenzhen has effectively emulated Hong 
Kong's model.
Practically speaking, Hong Kong's 
development remains deeply interconnected 
with the Pearl River Delta, especially 
Shenzhen. Nevertheless, the artificial barriers 
created by "identity politics" have isolated 
Hong Kong from the mainland, causing 
hesitation among many young people to 
engage with it.
In contrast, Shenzhen, as a city built on 
immigration, has fostered an effective 
relationship between the government and 
society. Many of Shenzhen's decision-making 
processes are open and transparent. Policies 
are shaped by public input but are not overly 
influenced by special interests or narrow 
"public opinions." Instead, the government 
prioritizes the overall well-being of society. 
This balanced approach has ensured both 
economic growth and social stability.
 
Shenzhen and Colombo were 
established as sister cities in 2014, 
aiming to foster trade, investment, 
culture, and technology cooperation. 
How has this partnership evolved, 
and what tangible impacts has it 
had on the economic and cultural 
development of both cities?
I don't have extensive information about the 
friendship city relationship between Shenzhen 
and Colombo, but I would like to share some 
inspiring examples of medical mutual aid that 
have strengthened the bond between these two 
cities. Shenzhen's "One Belt, One Road Public

Welfare Tour" has provided cross-border 
assistance in Sri Lanka, helping local patients 
with cataracts and cleft lips and palates embark 
on the path to recovery. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, 
renowned for having the world's highest 
cornea donation rate, has brought the gift of 
sight to residents of Shenzhen.
I was mesmerized to learn that Sri Lanka, with 
a population of just over 20 million, has over 
1.1 million individuals voluntarily registered as 
cornea donors after death. It is heartwarming 
to know that from the 1960s to April 2015, Sri 
Lanka donated more than 71,000 corneas to 
57 countries and over 140 regions worldwide. 
Among these, over 2,000 corneas were donated 
to China, greatly benefiting Shenzhen.
To reciprocate this generosity, the Shenzhen 
Foreign Affairs Office organized the "One Belt, 
One Road Public Welfare Tour" delegation 
to visit Colombo. They provided medical 
assistance to local patients with cleft lips, 
palates, and cataracts. 
Renowned Shenzhen ophthalmologist Dr. 
Yao Xiaoming led a team of experts from 
Shenzhen Eye Hospital and Xiamen University 
Xiamen Eye Center to Colombo, where they 
performed surgeries on 1,000 cataract patients, 
expressing their gratitude for Sri Lanka's 
cornea donations to China.
In recent years, Shenzhen and Colombo have 
deepened their exchanges and cooperation 
in the medical field. The Shenzhen Foreign 
Affairs Office has fully integrated social 
resources and mobilized non-governmental 
organizations to actively participate, fostering 
people-to-people connectivity through 
medical collaboration.
 
Shenzhen has seen significant growth 
in tourism, attracting millions of 
visitors to attractions like Window

of the World and OCT Loft. What 
strategies have driven this success? In 
your view, how can Sri Lanka emulate 
Shenzhen's success in the tourism 
sector?
Shenzhen's tourism development can be 
attributed to several key factors:
1. Government Support: Over the past 
decade, the Shenzhen government has actively 
promoted the tourism industry by providing 
substantial funding and allocating land 
resources. Their efforts aim to create a unique 
and diverse urban identity for Shenzhen.
2.Technological Innovation: Shenzhen has 
embraced technology to enhance the tourist 
experience. Mobile apps for navigation, 
ticketing, and information sharing improve 
accessibility and convenience for visitors. 
Moreover, leveraging digital marketing 
strategies through social media and digital 
platforms has enabled the city to reach broader 
audiences and showcase its attractions in real-
time.
For a historically rich country like Sri Lanka, 
I believe the following strategies could be 
employed to boost its tourism sector:
1. Emphasize Cultural Heritage: By 
highlighting its rich history, traditions, and 
natural beauty, Sri Lanka can develop unique 
attractions that appeal to global visitors.
2. Invest in Infrastructure: Enhancing 
transportation networks and improving 
facilities will make it easier for tourists to 
explore the country, significantly improving 
their overall experience.
3. Leverage Technology: Adopting smart 
tourism solutions, such as mobile apps 
for travel planning and virtual tours, can 
streamline operations and enhance the visitor 
experience, making travel more efficient and 
enjoyable.
By implementing these strategies, Sri Lanka 
can effectively strengthen its tourism sector 
and attract a larger number of visitors.
 
How has Shenzhen balanced cultural 
preservation with modernization, and 
what lessons can Srilanka draw from 
its approach?
Shenzhen is a quintessential immigrant city, 
home to people from diverse backgrounds 
and regions with varying demands. Its 
development has flourished through the 
fusion of multiple cultures. In its early stages, 
Shenzhen faced significant challenges due to 
the lack of foreign and Hong Kong investment. 
However, after overcoming these initial 
hurdles, the city shifted its focus to prioritizing 
domestic capital, fostering the growth of a 
substantial number of local enterprises.
When a city is dominated by foreign 
investment, it inevitably becomes more 
susceptible to external influences, making 
it difficult to withstand global changes. 
Conversely, if a city isolates itself from 
foreign investment, it may struggle to keep up 
with modern advancements. Shenzhen has 
successfully struck a balance between domestic 
and foreign capital, aided by its institutional 
innovations rooted in the principles of a 
socialist market economy with Chinese 
characteristics.
For countries like Srilanka, which have 
deep cultural roots, there is less need to 
be concerned about the impact of external 
cultures. Instead, the emphasis could be on

shifting mindsets and fostering a more open 
attitude toward external ideas and influences, 
which could greatly benefit the city's 
development. 
 
Shenzhen is now regarded as the 
'Silicon Valley of Hardware.' How did 
the city develop an ecosystem that 
fosters technological innovation?
Shenzhen's emergence as the "Silicon Valley 
of Hardware" is the result of a confluence of 
factors that have fostered an environment 
conducive to technological innovation:
1. Government Supportive Policies: 
Shenzhen's city government plays an 
active role in supporting innovation by 
implementing policies that provide funding, 
tax benefits, talent incentives, and other 
support for technology companies. The city 
has established a robust innovation ecosystem 
to promote the growth of deep-tech firms and 
the integration of scientific and technological 
innovation with industries. Additionally, 
the government allocates no less than 30% 
of municipal-level scientific research funds 
to basic and applied research, supporting 
groundbreaking work in cutting-edge fields 
and core technologies. 
2. Strong Market Demand and Robust 
Manufacturing Base: As one of the world's 
largest hubs for electronic products, 
Shenzhen boasts significant market demand 
and a well-established industrial chain that 
drives companies to innovate continuously. 
Its comprehensive hardware supply chain 
facilitates rapid responses to market needs, 
from design and prototyping to large-scale 
production. This makes Shenzhen a magnet 
for hardware innovators and entrepreneurs 
worldwide, enabling them to turn innovative

strengthening its talent pipeline.
4. Culture of Innovation and 
Entrepreneurship: Shenzhen is renowned 
for its entrepreneurial spirit, characterized by 
a "make it happen" mindset that encourages 
risk-taking and experimentation. This 
culture has resulted in a high rate of startup 
formation. 
5. Access to Capital: Shenzhen boasts a 
vibrant investment ecosystem comprising 
venture capital, private equity, and government 
funding. Home to one of China's three stock 
exchanges, the city attracts investors eager to 
support its innovative startups and technology 
companies. Numerous tech-focused 
accelerators and incubators further aid early-
stage companies in scaling their operations 
and achieving growth
Shenzhen's diverse and youthful 
population is a key driver of its 
economic vibrancy. What factors have 
made the city so attractive to migrants 
and young people?
 
Shenzhen attracts a significant number of 
migrants and young people primarily due to 
the following factors:
1. Economic Development and Job 
Opportunities: As one of China's major 
economic centers, Shenzhen boasts a rapidly 
growing economy and abundant job. This 
robust economic growth provides a conducive 
environment for career advancement, 
particularly appealing to the younger 
population.
2. Migration Culture and Policy 
Environment: Shenzhen's strong migrant 
culture and transparent, relaxed policies 
make it highly attractive to newcomers. The 
philosophy of "once you come, you are a 
Shenzhener" is deeply ingrained, creating an 
inclusive environment that helps newcomers 
integrate seamlessly into city life.
3. Young Population Structure: As one 
of China's youngest cities, Shenzhen has a 
vibrant and energetic atmosphere fueled by 
its youthful demographic. This abundance of 
young people injects energy and innovation 
into the city, fostering a dynamic environment 
conducive to creativity and progress.
4. Cultural Diversity and Inclusiveness: 
Shenzhen's cultural inclusiveness and 
acceptance of individuals from diverse 
backgrounds create fertile ground for 
innovation and cultural exchange. The city's 
blend of migrant and reform cultures forms 
a unique identity that values exploration, 
pioneering spirit, innovation, openness, and 
tolerance.

of the Kankesanthurai (KKS) port and 
drive regional economic growth?
Based on Shenzhen's success as a major 
port city, I believe Jaffna can draw several 
lessons to unlock the full potential of the 
Kankesanthurai (KKS) port for imports 
and exports. Firstly, Jaffna should prioritize 
enhancing infrastructure and connectivity 
around the KKS port to ensure seamless 
logistics and transportation. Shenzhen has 
actively advanced the development of smart 
ports, employing cutting-edge technologies 
such as advanced applications and artificial 
intelligence to optimize transportation 
efficiency. By offering services like LCL (Less-
than-Container-Load) consolidation and port-
bonded warehouse facilities, Shenzhen delivers 
convenient shipping solutions tailored to small 
and medium-sized enterprises.
Secondly, Jaffna can adopt a proactive 
approach to attracting foreign investments and 
partnerships, mirroring Shenzhen's strategy 
of leveraging international collaborations to 
stimulate port activities. Lastly, Jaffna should 
emphasize skill development and training 
programs for the local workforce to meet the 
evolving demands of a growing port industry, 
just as Shenzhen prioritized investment in 
human capital to drive the expansion of its 
port.
