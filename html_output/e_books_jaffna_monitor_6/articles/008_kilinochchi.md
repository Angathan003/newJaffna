A 
young mother and her 
innocent two-year-old 
daughter were tragically struck 
down by a tipper truck driven 
by a drunk driver involved in 
smuggling stolen sand. The 
truck collided with a motorbike 
carrying a family of four near 
the Kilinochchi Zonal Education 
Office.
The crash claimed two lives, 
leaving behind a grieving husband 
and a six-year-old elder daughter.
The accident instantly claimed the 
life of little Gajan Abivarni, just 
two years old. Her mother, Gajan 
Yalini, fought for her life for a few 
days but ultimately succumbed 
to her injuries. Varatheeswaran 
Gajan, 40, and their elder 
daughter, six-year-old Gajan 
Isainila, sustained severe injuries.

Gajan Yalini was later transferred to the Jaffna 
Teaching Hospital for advanced treatment but 
tragically passed away. The family revealed that 
they were on their way to celebrate Christmas 
together when the accident occurred.
In a scene so heartrending it could pierce even 
the coldest of hearts, the wounded father, 
Gajan, his body battered and broken, attended 
his wife’s funeral in an ambulance. Unable to 
stand or move unaided, he could not perform 
the last rites for his beloved wife and daughter.

Rampant Sand Smuggling in Kilinochchi
This devastating incident has also drawn 
attention to the larger issue of rampant illegal 
sand smuggling in Kilinochchi. The area has 
become a hotspot for unchecked sand mining, 
reportedly carried out with the tacit approval 
of local politicians and law enforcement.
Visitors to Kilinochchi can witness scores of 
tipper trucks transporting smuggled sand 
at dangerous speeds. According to sources, 
police, who are tasked with curbing these 
illegal activities, are instead complicit in the 
operations, often taking bribes to let the trucks 
pass. Reports suggest that each tipper pays 
approximately LKR 1,000 as a bribe to police 
squads stationed on the roads. In some cases, 
special arrack bottles are allegedly offered as 
additional "favors."
A local source told Jaffna Monitor, "It's a 
common sight in Kilinochchi to see policemen 
standing on roads day and night, stopping 
tippers not to enforce the law, but to collect 
bribes. This practice has become normalized."
The Hidden Network: How Kilinochchi's 
Sand Mafia Operates with Impunity
Sources say that a well-organized and deeply 
entrenched system supports the sand mafia 
in Kilinochchi, operating with precision and 
efficiency. Even seemingly ordinary lanes play 
a critical role in smuggling operations within 
this shadow network. A few shopkeepers and 
homeowners along these routes often act as 
informants, or "recces," closely monitoring the 
movements of law enforcement officers and 
tipping off smugglers in real-time.
Locals note that what is particularly troubling 
is the involvement of Kilinochchi's youth in 
this illicit trade. A significant number of young 
people, enticed by the prospect of easy money, 
find themselves entangled in the web of sand 
smuggling. For many, it is a quick way to earn 
a living, with little consideration for the long-
term consequences—both for themselves and 
their community.
A local source, speaking to Jaffna Monitor on 
the condition of anonymity, shed light on the 
deeper layers of this operation. "If you trace 
the roots of every sand mafia network," the 
source revealed, "it invariably leads to a Tamil 
politician or someone closely connected to a 
politician."
Unchecked sand smuggling has caused severe 
environmental damage, with both major and 
minor rivers losing their riverbeds, leading to 
widespread ecological degradation. Even in the 
more remote areas of Kilinochchi, tractors can 
often be seen stationed in the middle of dying 
rivers, extracting sand from the riverbeds 
without any intervention.
This tragedy has sparked outrage among 
Kilinochchi residents, who are demanding 
immediate action. Calls for stricter 
enforcement of laws against drunk driving 
and reckless vehicle operation are intensifying, 
along with demands to put an end to illegal 
sand mining.
Recently, locals staged a protest against 
reckless driving, emphasizing that those 
responsible, regardless of political affiliations, 
must be held accountable.
