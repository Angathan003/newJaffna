A
fter years of being unofficially barred 
from entering Sri Lanka, Gary 
Anandasangaree, Canada's Minister 
responsible for the Northern Economic 
Development Agency and a Sri Lankan 
Tamil of notable heritage, has finally set foot 
in his ancestral homeland. Gary, the son 
of maverick Sri Lankan Tamil politician V. 
Anandasangaree—an ardent critic of the 
LTTE and its leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran—
ironically found himself often labeled as a 
pro-LTTE advocate. His vocal stances on 
Tamil issues and human rights frequently 
made headlines and rendered his entry into Sri 
Lanka a politically charged matter.
A few months ago, former Sri Lankan 
Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, in an exclusive 
interview with Jaffna Monitor, did not mince 
words when discussing the Tamil diaspora's 
investment potential. While emphasizing that 
"thousands of visas are issued daily to diaspora 
Tamils," Sabry remarked pointedly, "The only 
visa we declined was that of Canada's Minister

Gary Anandasangaree. We did not want to 
be a tool in his political play. That's why we 
rejected it."
However, with the National People's Power 
(NPP) government now at the helm, Gary's 
visa was finally approved, paving the way for 
his long-anticipated visit to Sri Lanka.
During his visit, Gary met with 
parliamentarians from the Ilankai Tamil Arasu 
Katchi (ITAK) in Colombo. The meeting, 
held in Bambalapitiya, was attended by ITAK 
MPs Thurairasa Ravikaran, Padmanathan 
Sathiyalingam, Shanmugam Kugathasan, 
Gnanamuthu Srinesan, and Ilayathambi 
Srinath.
However, prominent ITAK leaders, including 
MPs Sritharan, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, 
and the party's legal luminary M.A. 
Sumanthiran, were notably absent, as they 
were in Tamil Nadu attending the Tamil Nadu 
government's Ayalaga Tamilar Dhinam (Day 
of the Global Tamil Diaspora). Whether their 
absence was due to scheduling conflicts or a 
deliberate choice to distance themselves from 
Gary at the Bambalapitiya meeting remains a 
matter of speculation.
While Gary's visit marked an important 
political milestone, it also brought attention 
to his estranged relationship with his father, 
V. Anandasangaree. Gary's mother, Yogam, 
separated from Anandasangaree in the 1980s, 
and the father and son have reportedly met 
only twice since—most recently in 1983.
Although sources hint that V. Anandasangaree 
was in Kilinochchi during Gary's visit, a 
father-son reunion was clearly not on the 
itinerary. The two managed to stay as far apart 
emotionally as they did geographically.
