The elephant in the room
This piece written about events which 
unfolded commencing the 70’s captures a 
transition from political processes to militancy 
and within the elimination or disbanding of 
armed groups and the silencing of advocacy 
and civil expression contesting the will of the 
primary proponents of militancy.  It requires 
empathy for the feelings of those who survived 
as victims, imagination of the last moments of 
those whose lives were extinguished and even 
going into the minds of those responsible in 
the planning and execution.    
The growth of militancy from peaceful politics 
is dark and troubling. The idealism replaced 
by the will of the gun becomes clearly evident. 
In the process killing and silencing of dissent 
was the means and order of the day. Be it 
within groups, on groups, amongst groups and 
civilians unconnected to groups. Net result 
being lives extinguished. Scores more were 
forcibly led to war, never to return home again. 
Very many suffered immense pain in mind 
and body. We have to date made no effort to 
account and be responsible for the hundreds 
of killings, disappearances and pain amongst 
Tamils caused by Tamils in the absence of a 
formal process which enables it. 
I recall seeing the head of the suicide bomber 
who assassinated Dr. Neelan Tituchelvam 
on Kynsey Road and asking myself how 
did a human being become a human bomb 
exploding with clinical precision.  It was a 
mind boggling example of the extent to which 
human beings had become programmed to kill 
and be killed.
This piece does not focus on what groups did 
by way of assassinations, killings, torture or 
disappearances of those who they fought with 
or eliminated i.e. armed forces and police and 
politicians from mainstream political parties. 
That is for a national process to examine. 
Also set aside are those killings and atrocities 
carried out by the armed forces on the 
commands of select government functionaries 
since that is the subject of existing national 
and international narratives and testimonies 
and continuing scrutiny. 
Conceptual framework for 
Reconciliation
Reconciliation is a complex concept because 
of its multidimensional nature: one can 
approach it through a variety of disciplines 
(Torrent Oliva 2011:20). The first one focuses 
on reconciliation as an outcome; a state in 
which parties have changed their relationships 
and are mutually recognising each other’s 
goals and interests in a peaceful environment 
(Howard 2004:197; Bar-tal and Bennink 
2004:11–15). The second perspective shifts 
attention to how reconciliation unfolds vis-à-
vis motivations, goals, beliefs, and emotions 
of parties. According to this perspective, 
the victim and the perpetrator have an 
opportunity to transform the nature of their 
relationship into one that facilitates the 
emergence of a new social context that is 
accompanied by possibilities for a peaceful 
future (Daly and Sarkin 2004:180–182; Maoz 
2004:225; Lederach 1997:101–110). Conceived 
as a process, reconciliation places weight not 
only on ending violence or conflict, but also 
on the steps that lead to the construction 
of new relationships in which both victims 
and perpetrators benefit from the new 
environment. The process takes place in efforts 
and activities that are deliberately meant to 
address unresolved conflict. I understanding 
is that as long as people previously involved 
in conflict do not undergo this process, the 
conflict persists and the potential for relapse is 
ever present.

There is a general consensus that desired 
outcomes can be successfully achieved if 
the process embraces and promotes five 
fundamental prerequisites – truth, apology, 
forgiveness, reparation and promoting 
encounter. These should be implemented in 
chronological order as follows:
• The truth, or a close approximation of 
it, needs to be exposed to enable parties 
to understand their common history: an 
important basis for shared beliefs. However, 
appropriate mechanisms are needed to deal 
with complex situations since parties may 
find it difficult to eliminate bias in their 
narratives (Daly and Sarkin 2004:146).
• Apology marks the formal acceptance of 
responsibility by perpetrators, and is the 
basis for forgiveness by victims.
• Forgiveness embodies the values of love, 
empathy and mercy. Together with truth 
and apology, forgiveness constitutes the 
moral foundation of the reconciliation 
process.
• Reparation involves the retribution the 
perpetrator needs to pay to the victim in 
order to restore lost relationship.
The five prerequisites are to be pursued in a 
context of justice. But yet another challenge 
arises as to which approach to justice best 
serves the goal to sustain reconciliation. 
Lessons Learnt Reconciliation 
Commission (LLRC)
The Commission expresses the view that 
“the country may not have been confronted 
by a violent separatist agenda, if the political 
consensus at the time of independence 
had been sustained and policies had been 
implemented to build up and strengthen the 
confidence of the minorities around a system 
which had gained a reasonable measure of 
confidence.” (8.137)     
The political grievances of the Tamil 
community stem from the breakdown of this 
consensus and the dismantling of the political 
contract it sustained. 
The LLRC’s vision of the Sri Lankan identity is 
multi-ethnic and multi religious. It is based on 
full compliance with and observance of human

rights that guarantees equality of citizenship 
for all. It is reinforced by the core moral and 
spiritual values shared by the four major world 
religions. 
The value framework in the Report includes 
the following:
Truth.  In all matters the commitment to the 
truth is a precondition of reconciliation. In 
regard to the past roots of the conflict, the 
LLRC advocates a searching reappraisal. 
In regard to the suffering caused by the 
conflict, the deaths of civilians, the missing 
persons and disappearances the truth must 
be fully uncovered both for the purpose 
of  healing and bringing a closure to the 
anguish of survivors as well as for the 
purpose of  ensuring  the accountability 
of those who committed the crimes and 
violations of human rights. 
Transparency. Truth goes with transparency 
– the conditions in which actions must be 
taken so that the truth is accessible to all 
the concerned persons. Transparency that 
provides full information to the concerned 
citizens would be an essential condition of 
reconciliation in all the actions taken on 
the issues that have been listed. The LLRC 
stresses that transparency goes together 
with the right to information.    
Justice and Accountability.  The LLRC 
report deals with accountability in three 
different contexts. The first is in the context 
of the war and the specific crimes and the 
violations of human rights committed in 
the course of the war.  The second is the 
observance of human rights in post conflict 
conditions. The third is accountability 
pertaining to the roots of the conflict 
and the political processes that led to its 
escalation.   
These three dimensions of justice and 
accountability reinforce and temper each 
other in the LLRC’s approach to justice and 
reconciliation.
Status quo in Ceylon on the eve of 
Independence
The Soulbury Commission when it 
recommended the Constitution for an 
independent Ceylon regarded “communalism” 
or ethnicity as being the greatest impediment 
to the evolution of a united Ceylonese people.  
With the objective of mitigating the effect 
of the ethnic divisions, the Commission 
went to the extreme of removing all forms of  
communal  representation  in the democracy 
it established, hoping that the  rule  of the 
majority that will emerge thereby will develop 
on secular lines shorn of the ethno-cultural  
dimensions.
They entertained the unrealistic hope that 
the divisive character of ethnic identities will 
be removed from the polity and effaced. At 
the same time the Soulbury Commission 
Lord Soulbury

recognized the deep –seated contradictions 
that were unique to Sri Lanka.  It pointed 
out that the equality of citizenship which the 
new constitution upheld had to be achieved 
in a demographic situation in which there is 
a permanent majority of the Sinhala people 
much larger in size than all other ethnic 
groups (Tamil, Muslim, Burgher and others) 
put together. The proportions today are in 
the range of 75% Sinhala to 25% of all other 
minorities. 
The Soulbury Commission observes that  
“the character of the majority–minority 
relations have been consequently shaped by 
these realities and governed by deep-seated 
pre-dispositions that were entrenched in 
the consciousness of both the majority and 
minority. The Tamil community and other 
minorities see themselves in a position of 
a permanent minority and perceive the 
Sinhala community as enjoying a position 
of an “unassailable majority”. These were the 
principal causes of apprehension and distrust.   
The Soulbury Commission concluded “that 
while constitutional and administrative 
safeguards were necessary to deal with these 
problems none of these safeguards will be 
adequate to guarantee equality of citizenship 
without a fundamental change in the pre-
dispositions of both the majority and minority 
towards each other.” (LLRC 8.157).
The Soulbury Commissioners were objectively 
critical of the attitudes of both communities. 
The Soulbury Commission pointed out that 
elements of discrimination were perceived 
by the Tamil community even when actions 
are “based on reasons of sound policy”.  It 
urged that the Tamil minority while focusing 
on their real grievances must guard against 
misperceptions of this type. At the same time, 
it emphasized that the majority community 
must “take the utmost care to avoid giving 
cause for any suspicion of unfairness or 
partiality” and stated that this perception will 
persist until the minorities have an equitable 
share of power and responsibility for the affairs 
of government. 
What the Soulbury Commission expected 
was a process of confidence building which 
would develop a strong base of mutual trust 
between the minorities and the majority 
leading to an equitable sharing of power and 
resources. What occurred however was quite 
the opposite.
In the newly emerging democracy, Sri Lanka’s 
post-independence English-speaking elites 
sought to respond and contain the electoral 
pressures with political ideologies which were 
ethno-centric, promoting the interests of their 
own ethnic constituency. They left little space 
for a multi–ethnic inclusive national identity. 
A decade after independence the island 
erupted in the first outbreak of ethnic violence 
in 1958.  The conditions were set for a long 
spiral of violence and counter-violence.
Sri Lanka’s civil war which started in 1983 and 
went through several phases, interspersed by 
failed peace efforts is commonly divided into 
Eelam wars I (1983-1987), II (1990-1994), III 
(1995-2002) and IV (2006-2009), although 
the divide between ‘war’ and ‘peace’ was never 
as clear as this timeline suggests – war was 
preceded by other forms of violence including 
assassinations, riots,  suicide attacks and  
killings of civilians, whilst periods of ‘peace’ 
were frequently preceded by high levels of 
violence.
Emergence of Tamil armed groups in 
dissent 
It is virtually impossible to set a date for 
the genesis of Tamil militancy in Sri Lanka. 
After 1956 riots, a group of Tamils organized

and opened fire at the Sri Lankan army in 
Batticaloa. Two Sinhalese were killed when 
11 Tamils, having between them seven rifles, 
fired at a convoy of Sinhalese civilians and 
government officials one night at a village near 
Kalmunai. There was another attack on army 
soldiers in Jaffna after Colombo stifled the 
Federal Party "satyagraha" in 1961, but no one 
was killed. Some of 20 men associated with 
the Federal Party thought Gandhisam had no 
place in such a separate state. At a meeting in 
Colombo, they christened their group Pulip 
Padai (Army of Tigers). On August 12, 1961, 
the Pulip Padai members converged at the 
historic Koneswaran Temple in the eastern 
port of town of Trincomalee and, standing in 
its holy precincts facing the sea took a solemn 
oath to fight for a Tamil homeland. A student 
wing called the Manavar Manram (student's 
council) was set up in 1963. 
In 1969, Thangathurai and Kuttimani and 
a few friends gathered in Jaffna to form an 
informal group that the former wanted to 
name the Tamil Liberation Organization 
(TLO). It included among others Periya (big) 
Sothi, Chinna (small) Sothi, Chetti, Kannadi 
(a radio mechanic), Sri Sabaratnam (TELO 
leader) and V. Prabhakaran (LTTE supremo). 
One man who drifted by but broke away to 
chart an independent course was Ponnudorai 
Sivakumaran, who was to become one of the 
first martyrs to the Tamil cause.
Earlier, in 1970, Ponnudorai Satyaseelan 
founded the Tamil Manavar Peravai (Tamil 
Students League), which was joined by 
Sivakumaran who attempted to assassinate Sri 
Lankan deputy minister for Cultural Affairs 
Somaweera Chandrasiri in September 1970 
and Alfred Duraiyappah, the Jaffna Mayor, in 
February 1971.
The formation of TUF in 1972 led to the Tamil 
Elaingyar Peravai (TYL-Tamil Youth League) 
in January 1973. It was founded by some 40 
youths, many of whom subsequently were in 
the forefront of the militant movement. The 
TYL drew support from Thangathurai, the 
TLO leader. Satyaseelan's arrest in February 
1973 set off the second round of mass arrests 
in Jaffna and virtually crippled the TYL as well 
as the older Tamil Students League. Several 
young men languished in prison until 1977, 
Thangathurai and Kuttimani

although some gained amnesty on the eve of 
the Kankesanthurai by-election in 1975. 
The tragic appearance of Tamil insurgents 
dedicated to violent action against the 
government was a development in the 
1970s becoming militant in 1972, when the 
government introduced standardization 
policies on university admission and the 
9 accidental deaths which occurred in the 
course of a police attack on participants of an 
international Tamil conference held in Jaffna in 
1974. The purpose of which was academic and 
cultural held previously only in Madras and 
Kuala Lumpur. The police officer who led the 
attack was promoted and the Mayor of Jaffna 
who cooperated was killed the following year.
 Jaffna witnessed its first case of death by 
cyanide poisoning the next year. Sivakumaran 
had been lying low for a while, but took an 
active interest in the 1974 International Tamil 
Conference in Jaffna. He had been influenced 
by his parent's pro-Federal Party views. He 
believed that despite the need for militancy, 
the Federal Party was important and often 
compared Chelvanayagam with Mahatma 
Gandhi and the boys with Subash Chandra 
Bose. 
Since breaking off from Thangathurai, 
Sivakumaran had set up his group, which 
came to be known as the Sivakumaran's group. 
On June 5, 1974, Sivakumaran was trapped 
by the police while attempting a bank robbery 
in Jaffna's Kopai town. He was 17 years of 
age and used to carry a cyanide pill. On that 
day he swallowed it without so much as an 
afterthought and died almost instantly. Thus, 
was born Sri Lanka's cyanide culture.
In 1974, Jaffna engulfed in protests when 
Bandaranaike visited the town to open a 
university campus. The Mayor, Duraiyappah 
did his best to bring crowds to her meeting. 
The visit was preceded by several acts of 
violence which the police blamed on the 
newly-formed Tamil New Tigers (TNT) of 
Prabhakaran. Bombs were thrown at a police 
jeep in Kankesanthurai, a port town. Another 
bomb went off at the residence of a communist 
leader who was to be the premier's interpreter.
Two underground groups were active in 
1975. The Thangathurai group, benefit of 
Kuttimani, and the TNT, which in informed 
circles came to be known as the Prabhakaran's 
group. In January 1975, a group of Sri Lankan 
Tamils residing in London formed the Eelam 
Revolutionary Organisation which took the 
acronym EROS. Although it failed to take 
roots in Sri Lankan Tamil areas for a long time, 
it played a key role in shaping the growth of 
militancy.
The Duraiyappah assassination was the first 
political murder in Sri Lankan's northeast. 
Chelvanayagam's election victory had queered 
the pitch for the Eelam campaign. The number 
of militants in Jaffna then could not have been 
more than 50. The popular perception among 
the ordinary Tamils was that the "boys", as the 
young guerrillas were called with adoration, 
were acting under the orders, if not the 
control, of the TUF and that they could and 
would be caged if need be.
On March 5, 1976 Prabhakaran led a raid 
on the state-run People's Bank at Puttur 
and escaped with a half a million rupees in 
cash and jewellery worth 200,000 rupees 
after holding the employees at gun point. 
Prabhakaran founded the LTTE on May 5, 
1976. 
From the Tamil standpoint, the 1977 polls 
were momentous in 3 ways.
1.	For the 1st time, one of Sri Lanka's main 
parties admitted publicly that there existed a 
Tamil Problem.

Jaffna Monitor

2.	For the 1st time, a Tamil party was 
propelled as the main opposition in the Sri 
Lankan Parliament.
3.	The sweeping outcome in the northeast 
polls catapulted Tamil militancy.
Emergence of Uma Maheswaran and LTTE
Early on the morning of August 15, 1977, three 
unarmed constables stopped 3 boys riding 
bicycles at Puttur, Jaffna. Without warning, 
one of the boys took out a revolver and fired, 
injuring one of the policemen in the thigh. 
The cyclists escaped. The next day, police 
shot and killed four persons and wounded 21 
others in a bloody shoot-out in Jaffna after the 
policemen were obstructed from seizing arms 
carried by some youths.
JR, angry at what he thought was the audacity 
of the "boys", ordered the army into Jaffna, 
where the old market was almost totally gutted 
in a fire the Tamils blamed on the security 
forces. The 1977 anti-Tamil riots had begun. 
Sinhalese mobs began attacking Tamils 
outside the northeast. For the first time, a large 
number of Hindu temples came under attack 
during the two weeks of arson and rioting, 
which left more than 300 people dead and 
many more wounded. Thousands of Tamils 
left their homes and fled to the northeast for 
safety. They included an estimated 40,000 
Indian Tamils, many of whom became 
destitute overnight even though they were 
opposed to the Eelam campaign. Many of 
them went to Vavuniya in the North, where 
several voluntary groups helped them to begin 
a new life. Many were sent to Jaffna by 3 ships.
The riots provoked indignation in Tamil 
Nadu, which until then had remained largely 
indifferent to the plight of the island Tamils. 
The DMK, which only 4 years ago had handed 
over Kuttimani to the Sri Lankan authorities, 
organized a general strike and a mammoth 
procession that wound its way through 
the city to the office of the Deputy High 
Commissioner of Sri Lanka.
But in 1977, no Sinhalese living in Jaffna 
came under attack from Tamils. Until the 
Tamil militancy took deep roots in Jaffna, 
almost 10% of its population was Sinhalese, 
who were bakers, traders, civil servants and 
businessmen. The 1977 anti-Tamil riots were 
different from earlier Sinhalese onslaughts. 
In September, Thangathurai presided over a 
meeting at a temple in Thondaman Aru and 
decided to formally set up a militant group 
called the Tamil Eelam Liberation Army 
(TELA) and a political affiliate known as the 
Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO). 
By now, the most active militant groups in 
Jaffna were the ones led by Thangathurai and 
the LTTE.
In 1977, a soft-spoken land surveyor, 
Kadirgamapillai Nallainathan, better known 
as Uma Maheswaran, joined the LTTE. 
He was made the chairman of the central 
committee. Prabhakaran, younger to Uma by 
some 10 years, continued to be the group's 
military commander but remained largely in 
the background.  In January 1978, Uma and 
Prabha made their way to Colombo. The two 
shot M. Canagaratnam, a Tamil MP who had 
won on a TULF ticket but switched allegiance 
to the UNP. He was shot and wounded in the 
Uma Maheswaran

chest, neck and ribs but died a few months 
later. Canagaratnam's botched murder blew 
up Uma’s cover and he gave up the open life. 
The police, embarrassed that Tamil militants 
could strike in Colombo, launched a vicious 
crackdown under the supervision of Inspector 
T.I. Bastiampillai of the CID. After rounding 
up several suspects in Jaffna, police issued 
"wanted" posters for 4 men: Uma, Chellappah 
Nagarajah, Thanam (who had been once driver 
to Chelvanayagam) and Kannadi. Little did the 
police know that one of the four was already 
dead. Chetti murdered Kannadi in cold blood 
at Poonagari after breaking out of? the prison 
in the city of Anuradhapura in 1973.
A Split in the LTTE
In 1979, after the Thangathurai group shot 
dead 3 more policemen in Jaffna, JRJ replaced 
the Proscription of LTTE act with a more 
draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), 
clamped a state of emergency throughout 
Jaffna peninsula and sent more troops to the 
region. He also hand-picked Brigadier T.I. 
Weeratunge, Chief of the Army, to stamp out 
"the menace of terrorism in all its forms from 
the island" by December 31.The crackdown, 
for the first time, seriously disrupted the 
militant network. The mutilated bodies of 6 
youths picked up from their homes on July 
14 were found under a bridge. Because of 
this disruption, Thangathurai, Kuttimani 
and Prabhakaran fled to Tamil Nadu. Tamil 
militancy died down almost totally in 1980, 
but picked up again from early next year. There 
were growing differences within the militant 
ranks, particularly the LTTE which resulted 
in its split and the subsequent formation of 
PLOTE by Uma. 
On April 5, Kuttimani Thangathurai and 
Thevan were arrested at Mannalkadal, near 
Point Pedro, while trying to escape in a boat 
to India. Kuttimani had some gold on him, 
tried to shoot himself but was overpowered. 
It was the end of journey both for Kuttimani 
and Thangathurai, two of the original pillars 
of Tamil militancy. They were later brutally 
beaten to death in Colombo's Welikade jail 
during the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots.
The Changing Character of the Militants
In 1980, Jaffna University students published 
a paper called the Unarvu (Sensation) which 
put forward several Marxist slogans. About 
the same time the faction of the Tigers which 
the following year adopted the name of the 
P.L.O.T.E. started a paper with the name 
Puthiya Paathai (New Path). This paper 
took a political line critical of traditional 
parliamentary politics as well as of the hit and 
run tactics of the L.T.T.E. After two issues of 
the latter, Mr. Sunderam, a prominent person 
in the P.L.O.T.E., was assassinated by the 
L.T.T.E. while at the printers to bring out an 
issue of the paper. This was the first internal 
killing to surface publicly, although there had 
been several others before. Following this, two 
L.T.T.E. sympathizers Irai Kumaran and Umai 
Kumaran were killed by the P.L.O.T.E. Though 
people were alarmed, these incidents were not 
taken to be a sign of a deeper malaise. By 1986 
these internal killings were to reach epidemic 
proportions.
 The students of Jaffna University contributed 
considerably to the groups of the militant 
movement. The dedication of many of the 
students was such that they left their academic 
careers and went to rural areas and the Eastern 
Province to work for their organizations. 
Such persons were by nature intelligent, 
sensitive and bound to insist on democratic 
accountability from their leaders. With the rise 
of internal killings and autocratic leadership, 
these students became disillusioned.

By 1985 many of them started quitting their 
organizations to lead quiet lives. According 
to the testimony of their friends, several of 
those students who died, ended their lives 
in a state of disillusionment. The last three 
student union leaders up to 1985 had deep 
seated problems with the L.T.T.E.  Two of 
them left the organization and one died while 
doing refugee work. By the latter part of 
1985 the role of the students in the militant 
movement underwent a radical change. The 
students on the whole felt that the militant 
groups had gone astray and were locked in a 
war of attrition with each other. They felt this 
had brought the community to a dangerous 
brink. The main thrust of student action 
now was to: reform the militant movement 
through criticism and persuasion; provide 
relief for refugees; mediate between the public 
and the militants; and foster unity among the 
militant groups. Usually, the students did not 
go for confrontation with the militant groups 
but raised specific questions regarding their 
conduct. In April 1986 a demonstration from 
Vadamaratchi protesting the killing by the 
T.E.L.O. of T.E.L.O. members Das and four of 
his colleagues was fired upon. The students 
negotiated with the E.P.R.L.F. and P.L.O.T.E. 
to protect and shelter the demonstrators. The 
bodies of three demonstrators killed were 
taken to the University. In doing refugee 
work the students involved took considerable 
risks in going to difficult areas.  In this role 
the students were respected and also feared. 
Until the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash, the L.T.T.E. 
found the student movement useful. Though 
it no longer provided recruits, its criticisms 
were mainly directed against the T.E.L.O. One 
reason for this was that the L.T.T.E.'s actions 
were more secretive, and could not be directly 
ascribed. Following the L.T.T.E.-T.E.L.O. clash, 
the L.T.T.E. moved to suppress the students. 
This virtually ended the University's role in the 
militancy. Students of the past who had helped 
the growth of the militancy with dedication 
felt that they had been meanly used. The 
intellectual polish of the students had been 
useful but the leadership of the L.T.T.E which 
was dominant by the end of 1986 had a 
different mind-set - a totalitarian mind-set.
