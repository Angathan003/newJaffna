system, the hostile stance of the powerful 
Government Medical Officers' Association 
(GMOA), and the exclusionary mindset of 
local medical students who believe they should 
hold a monopoly on local medical education. 
These entrenched attitudes have long stifled 
the establishment of private medical colleges 
(PMCs) in the country—a reality Dr. Shane 
Halpe and his peers endured firsthand.
"My journey at SAITM began in 2009, right 
after I completed my London A-Levels. From 
as far back as I can remember, medicine was 
my calling—a dream born from passion, not 
pressure. There was no parental push, no 
family tradition to uphold, and no societal 
expectations to fulfill. Coming from a family 
with no medical background, this was 
entirely my own choice, driven by a deep 
fascination with the field and a desire to make 
a difference," Dr. Halpe began.
As a London A-Level graduate, Sri Lanka's 
state universities did not have a place for 
him. His choices were clear: pursue medicine 
abroad or take a leap of faith by joining 
SAITM, a newly established private medical 
university in Sri Lanka. He chose SAITM—
not only because it allowed him to stay close 
to his family but also because he believed in 
investing in his country and contributing to its 
future. "Staying home meant that every step I 
took would benefit not only my career but also 
the place I call home."

From the very beginning, SAITM students 
encountered challenges they could never have 
anticipated. "The mudslinging and negative 
media coverage were relentless. SAITM 
was disparaged as a 'factory of fake medical 
degrees.' We were labeled as purchasers 
of fraudulent qualifications, branded as 
unqualified students, and even accused of 
being unfit to qualify as healthcare cleaners, let 
alone as medical professionals.
The accusations were relentless. Dr. Shane 
continued, "We were dismissed as privileged 
rich kids, with no regard for the sacrifices 
our families made to support us. The slander 
infiltrated everyday life, and even the public 
was unkind. Relatives at social events, like 
weddings or funerals, would question the 
credibility of my education. The stigma was 
suffocating. Yet, I held onto one belief: my 
passion for medicine and my commitment to 
making a difference would prevail over the 
negativity.
As time went on, the challenges grew. Delays 
in their studies and a lack of access to proper 
clinical training facilities were constant 
hurdles. "In 2011, we went to Homagama 
Base Hospital for clinical training, only to be 
chased out by trade union actions. We tried to 
commence our clinical training at Nawaloka 
Hospital, a private institution, but our stay 
lasted only a few days before we were forced 
out again."
The difficulties were overwhelming. 
"There were moments when I questioned 
everything—my choice of medicine, my 
aspirations, even my purpose in life. As a 
Catholic, I sometimes considered becoming a 
priest. There were days of intense despair, and 
thoughts of giving up crossed my mind more 
times than I could admit. Some friends felt 
the same, and the weight of it all occasionally 
led to dark, even suicidal thoughts. But one 
incident stands out, a memory that still stings 
deeply."
"On August 17, 2017, a group of us SAITM 
students eagerly traveled to Kandy to attend 
the prestigious College of Surgeons Sessions. 
We had registered, paid our fees, and enjoyed 
the enriching lectures on the first day. But 
the next day, August 18, shattered our 
enthusiasm."
As we entered the conference hall for the 
second day, Dr. Shane continued, a senior 
official from the College of Surgeons stopped 
us. "The moment he realized we were from 
SAITM, his tone shifted," Dr. Halpe recalled 
bitterly. "'You are not allowed to participate,' 
he said curtly, citing an unspecified 'problem' 
from the previous day.
Stunned, the students sought clarification, but 
their polite inquiries were met with hostility. 
"Despite being registered participants—some 
of us already pre-interns—we were told our 
presence would 'disrupt' the conference. It 
wasn't just rejection; it was humiliation. We 
were treated like Outcasts, as if we didn't 
belong. When we pressed further, they offered 
a refund, but their tone left no doubt: we were 
unwelcome."
With no choice but to leave, the students 
exited the Grand Kandyan Hotel. "That 
incident made headlines, but the damage was 
done. We were denied entry simply because 
we were from SAITM. The GMOA and 
state university unions called us 'fake degree 
buyers,' vilifying us at every turn. But here's 
the irony," Dr. Halpe added with a wry smile.
Fast forward to September 12, 2024: one of my 
batchmates, now a surgical registrar, delivered 
an oration at the same prestigious College of 
Surgeons Sessions—the very event that had 
once humiliated us."

He continued with pride, "Today, there are 55 
postgraduate trainees among SAITM alumni, 
excelling in specialties like surgery, general 
medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, and nearly 
every postgraduate field. They said we were 
unqualified, but we proved them wrong. Not 
only did we compete with them—we excelled.
Dr. Shane, his eyes twinkling with the wisdom 
gleaned from life's trials, leaned forward. "A 
few years ago," he began, his voice resonating 
with quiet strength, "I encountered a parable 
by Ajahn Brahmavamso, a revered Buddhist 
monk. In his book Who Ordered This 
Truckload of Dung? he tells the story of 
someone faced with a pile of manure dumped 
at their doorstep. Two choices arise: wallow in 
misfortune or use it to fertilize their garden."
A thoughtful pause hung in the air as 
Dr. Shane, soon to be a family physician 
consultant, connected the parable to his own 
experiences. "This story resonated deeply 
with us SAITM students," he confided to 
Jaffna Monitor, "especially given the relentless 
negativity we faced. Instead of succumbing 
to despair, my peers and I transformed every 
insult and obstacle into fuel for our growth. 
We alchemized each pile of dung thrown 
at us into fertilizer, enriching our lives and 
blossoming despite adversity."
His expression shifted, a hint of defiant 
optimism glimmering in his eyes. "And as the 
great poet Pablo Neruda so eloquently stated," 
he continued, his voice rising with conviction, 
"You can cut all the flowers, but you cannot 
keep spring from coming." A warm smile 
spread across his face, a touch of strength in 
his tone. "They tried every possible way to 
suppress us, to stifle our progress—named 
us, shamed us—but, machan," he paused, the 
smile growing wider, "they cannot prevent the 
inevitable blossoming of our potential. Spring 
always arrives, machan."

Sri Lanka's Free Education: A Tale of 
Two Realities
The Sri Lankan free education system has 
undoubtedly transformed countless lives. 
While Sri Lanka claims to offer free education 
to its citizens, this holds true only to a certain 
extent, education experts told Jaffna Monitor. 
Sri Lanka does provide free primary and 
secondary education for all, but does it truly 
ensure free higher education for all deserving 
students? Unfortunately, the answer is a 
resounding no.
Thousands of students sit for the G.C.E. 
Advanced Level (A/L) examination each year, 
nurturing dreams of entering the country's 
state university system. Yet, the harsh reality 
is that only a tiny fraction of these hopefuls 
succeed, leaving the majority in despair and 
uncertainty about their future.
Consider the statistics: In 2023, 173,444 
students passed the A/L examination, 
qualifying them to pursue higher education 
at state universities. However, only 42,000 
students—a mere 24.2%—were admitted. 
This left a staggering 131,444 students, or 
75.8% of those eligible, without a place in 
state universities. The numbers were equally 
disheartening in 2022. Out of 171,497 students 
who passed the A/L examination, only 42,147 
students secured admission, leaving 129,350 
qualified candidates, or 75.4%, unable to 
access free higher education.
"What Are We Supposed to Do?"
Critics argue that while the country boasts of 
free education, the promise begins to crumble 
at the tertiary level. Limited infrastructure and 
resources mean that state-funded universities 
can only admit a fraction of eligible students, 
effectively denying the majority their right to

higher education.
This unmet demand forces thousands of 
students each year to seek alternatives abroad, 
spending millions of dollars to pursue their 
dreams. A student from Jaffna told Jaffna 
Monitor, "How can the system claim to be 
'free' when so many of us are left to fend for 
ourselves?"
The Unfair Gatekeeping of Sri Lanka's 
Medical Education System
State medical universities have limited seats, 
and the competition is cutthroat. Every 
year, countless capable students miss out—
not because they lack talent or drive, but 
simply due to the overwhelming number of 
candidates vying for a spot. "Does this mean 
these students are unfit to study medicine? Of 
course not!" said an educationist in a thought-
provoking conversation with Jaffna Monitor.
Exams like the A/L are designed to test 
knowledge under specific, high-pressure 
conditions. What they fail to measure are 
the qualities that truly define a great doctor: 
empathy, dedication, resilience, and an 
unwavering passion to serve others. "An 
average performance in one exam does not 
determine a student's capacity to excel in 
medicine," the educationist emphasized. 
"Being a successful doctor is about far 
more than academic brilliance—it's about 
perseverance, adaptability, and a commitment 
to the well-being of humanity."
The educationist stressed that if a student 
possesses these qualities, failing to secure 
admission to a state university should not 
disqualify them from their dream of becoming 
a doctor. "The world constantly needs 
more compassionate and qualified medical 
professionals. Discouraging someone based 
on a single exam score not only crushes their 
potential but also robs society of their future 
contributions."
Another educationalist, in a conversation 
with Jaffna Monitor, highlighted a pressing 
issue with Sri Lanka's university admission 
system. "Let me start with a caution—I am not 
against the existing district quota system. It 
has its merits," he began. "But there are glaring 
 An anti-SAITM protest

![p011_i1.jpg](images_out/004_cover_story/p011_i1.jpg)

12
inequalities within the system that cannot be 
ignored."
He explained, "Take the Colombo District, 
for instance. Even students who score 3As 
and achieve higher Z-scores in their A/Ls 
sometimes fail to secure a medical seat because 
of the intense competition. Meanwhile, in 
certain districts, students with 2CS and 
significantly lower Z-scores are admitted to 
medical school through the quota system. 
How can we justify a system that denies 
exceptional students the chance to pursue their 
dreams purely because of where they come 
from?"
The educationalist's frustration was evident 
as he continued, "To make matters worse, 
these high-performing students are not just 
denied the right to study medicine in state 
universities—they're also blocked from 
pursuing it in private institutions within Sri 
Lanka. Is this justified? How can we defend a 
system that essentially shuts the door on their 
future?"
He shared real-life examples to underscore 
the problem. "I personally know students who 
scored 2As and a B—brilliant, hardworking 
young people—yet they were left out of 
medicine. Despite their capability and 
determination, the system failed them. If 
someone with such outstanding results is told 
they can't study medicine at all because of this 
quota system, it's not just unfair—it's a crime."
I was born in the 'wrong' district
Dr. Dilan (name changed), now a practicing 
medical doctor, is an alumnus of a prestigious 
state school in the Colombo District. Despite 
scoring 2As and a B, with a strong Z-score, he 
was unable to secure a medical seat through 
the district quota system. "Becoming a doctor 
was my only dream since I can remember," he 
shared. Determined not to give up, he enrolled 
in SAITM to pursue his ambition.
However, his journey was far from smooth. 
"There was widespread opposition and 
systematic mudslinging against us," he 
recalled. One incident remains etched in his 
memory. "One day, my friend and I came 
across a photo of local medical students 
protesting against SAITM. They were holding 
placards, and one read: ' 'fndre Wmdê .kakd 
fydrd' ('fake degree buyers'). I was heartbroken 
and irritated at the same time."
Driven by frustration, he elaborated, "I 
decided to look into the backgrounds of some 
of the protesters. Ironically, the two medical 
students holding that placard had far lower 
results and Z-scores than mine in the same 
A/L exam. The only difference? I was born in 
the 'wrong' district, and they were born in the 
'right' district."
The Crisis of Medical Education in  
Sri Lanka
Currently, admission criteria for non-state 
medical schools in Sri Lanka are strictly 
regulated under Gazette Extraordinary No. 
2055/54, dated January 26, 2018, as outlined 
in the Medical (Maintenance of Minimum 
Standards of Medical Education) Regulations 
No. 01 of 2018, which were subsequently 
amended and published in Gazette No. 
2155/15, dated December 26, 2019. These 
regulations were initially approved by 
Parliament on November 3, 2020, under 
Section 72 of the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 
105).
However, while the draft regulations and 
amendments were in place, they became 
legally binding only after being certified by the 
Medical Ordinance (MPS) and published in 
Gazette No. 2222/69 on April 10, 2021. This

certification marked the official enforcement 
of the regulations.
According to these regulations, the minimum 
academic requirement for admission to 
state and non-state medical schools is two 
Credits and one Simple Pass in the Advanced 
Level (A/L) Examination, conducted by the 
Department of Examinations of the Ministry 
of Education, achieved in one and the same 
sitting.
Prior to the implementation of these 
regulations, there were no specific admission 
criteria for non-state medical schools. Any 
student who passed the A/L examination 
in the biology stream was eligible to pursue 
medical studies. Interestingly, some of 
Jaffna's most respected doctors, hailing from 
underprivileged districts like Kilinochchi and 
Mullaitivu, began their journeys with just 
three Simple Passes in the A/Ls.
Limited Seats, Unlimited Demand
In recent years, Sri Lanka has made notable 
strides in expanding access to medical 
education. Between 2015 and 2023, four 
new medical faculties were established in 
Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa, Uva Wellassa, and 
Moratuwa. Educationalists suggest that this 
expansion reflects the state's acknowledgment 
of the growing demand for medical education. 
However, despite these efforts, a significant 
number of students who meet the University 
Grants Commission (UGC) criteria for 
pursuing medicine still find themselves 
excluded from state medical schools.
The numbers paint a sobering picture. By 
the academic year 2023/2024, even with 
the addition of four new medical faculties, 
progress remained marginal. Out of 27,586 
students who qualified for medical education, 
only 2,059—a mere 7.46%—secured a spot 
in state-sponsored medical faculties. This 
staggering statistic reveals that nearly 92% of 
eligible students were left without access to 
state medical education.
Experts warn that Sri Lanka's state medical 
schools have already reached their breaking 
point. Any attempt to increase student 
intake without careful planning and 
substantial investment in resources would 
inevitably compromise the high standards 
upheld by the Sri Lanka Medical Council 
(SLMC). "Expanding capacity under the 
current conditions," they argue, "is not just 
challenging—it's simply unrealistic."
The economic crisis gripping Sri Lanka 
further compounds this issue, making the 
establishment of additional state medical 
faculties an even more distant dream. As 
one educationalist aptly remarked, "We 
cannot afford to dilute the quality of medical 
 SAITM students at a silent protest

education by stretching our already limited 
resources beyond their capacity."
The Medical Education Conundrum
While private universities and degree 
programs in other fields have gradually 
emerged to meet the growing demand—albeit 
inadequately—medicine remains a notable 
exception in Sri Lanka. For students aspiring 
to become doctors, the only realistic options 
are to pursue studies abroad or abandon their 
dream altogether and settle for alternative 
careers, as every effort to establish private 
medical universities within the country has 
met with fierce resistance.
Opposition to Private Medical Education
The strongest resistance to private medical 
universities comes from trade unions, most 
notably from the notorious Government 
Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), 
along with the All Ceylon Medical Officers 
Association (ACMOA), Federation of 
University Teachers' Associations (FUTA), and 
the Faculty of Medicine Teachers' Association 
(FMTA). Student bodies such as the Inter-
University Students Federation (IUSF) and 
various medical student unions also play a 
significant role.
Ironically, these students, who benefit from 
taxpayer-funded education, vehemently 
oppose those who choose to self-fund their 
studies. These groups don't merely object to 
private medical institutions—they actively 
engage in protests, smear campaigns, character 
assassination, and fear-mongering to derail 
any efforts to establish such universities. 
Alarmingly, they succeed every single time.
From the North Colombo Medical College 
(NCMC)—independent Sri Lanka's first 
privately funded medical school in the 1980s—
and the Moolai Medical College established in 
1985, to the more recent South Asian Institute 
of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), all 
have faced relentless opposition and were 
eventually shut down. The playbook has 
remained unchanged, and the outcome has 
predictably always favored the opposition.
The strategy? Saturate university students 
with misinformation, fueling fears that their 
free education is under threat. Systematically 
demonize private medical institutions by 
branding them as "fake degree factories" and 
portraying their students as mere buyers of 
worthless qualifications—unfit, incapable, and 
undeserving.
They don't stop there. Using orchestrated 
propaganda, they rally state university students 
to create a hostile public narrative, shaming 
and ostracizing private university students. 
The relentless pressure—amplified by this web 
of misinformation—forces the government to 
cave into their baseless demands, inevitably 
leading to the closure of these institutions.
The hypocrisy in their stance is glaring. They 
have no objection to Sri Lankan students 
going abroad to study medicine. Each year, 
a substantial number of students leave for 
countries like India, Bangladesh, China, 
Belarus, Russia, and many others to pursue 
medical degrees. These students collectively 
take millions of dollars in foreign exchange, 
boosting the economies of these nations while 
simultaneously depleting Sri Lanka's own 
foreign reserves.
After completing their degrees, these students 
return to Sri Lanka and sit for the Examination 
for Registration to Practice Medicine (ERPM). 
A significant majority pass the exam and 
go on to serve as doctors within Sri Lanka's 
healthcare system. Critics argue that if 
students studying medicine abroad can return, 
pass the ERPM, and practice in Sri Lanka, why

not allow private medical universities locally 
with a similar qualifying exam?
The Double Standards
Advocates for private medical colleges (PMCs) 
highlight the glaring contradiction in the 
stance of these unions and student groups. 
Likening this mindset to a feudal mentality.
"In the past, education was restricted to certain 
castes, and any attempt to educate lower castes 
was fiercely resisted out of fear that education 
would empower them and disrupt the existing 
hierarchy. Similarly, local medical students 
and unions seem to fear losing their monopoly 
over the medical profession and the associated 
social status. They are also well aware that 
private medical students may outperform 
them, which adds to their insecurity. As a 
result, they resort to character assassination 
and systematic vilification," the advocate 
elaborated. "They know that the establishment 
of private universities would mark the end of 
their hegemony," the advocate concluded in an 
interview with Jaffna Monitor.
Doctors for Free Education, But Not for 
My Sons!
Sources told Jaffna Monitor that one of the 
most vocal critics and leading opponents of 
private medical colleges (PMCs)—and the 
self-proclaimed commander-in-chief of anti-
PMC protests in Sri Lanka, as well as a master 
of mudslinging against SAITM—is a well-
known professor and head of a department at 
the Colombo Medical Faculty. He spearheaded 
relentless campaigns against SAITM, even 
going so far as to publicly declare that Sri 
Lanka has no need for private medical 
colleges. He has also claimed that the country 
already has enough doctors and does not 
require more.
From writing numerous articles and research 
papers (undeniably one-sided) to organizing 
conferences and founding the forum Doctors 
for Free Education to oppose PMCs, he left no 
stone unturned in his crusade. His advocacy 
made him the face of the anti-PMC movement 
in Sri Lanka.
But here's where the irony lies—and it's as 
sharp as it gets. While he vehemently opposed 
private medical colleges in Sri Lanka, he 
sent his own two sons abroad for medical 
education after they failed to qualify for state 
medical universities. This hypocrisy, a critic 
remarked, is the perfect example of the Tamil 
proverb: "jdf;F jdf;F vd;why; RsF> 
glf;F glf;F vd;W mbf;Fk;". Though it 
cannot be translated directly, it roughly means, 
"If it's for oneself, it's a gentle breeze; for 
others, it's a punishing storm."
Critics argue that while he denies other 
parents the opportunity to provide their 
children with quality medical education in Sri 
Lanka, he ensures his own children receive 
medical training abroad. These actions, they 
contend, expose a glaring contradiction 
between his words and deeds, highlighting

the hypocritical nature of such big shots who 
vehemently oppose private medical colleges 
(PMCs).
From Targets of Protest to Titans of 
Medicine: The NCMC Legacy
A classic example of private medical education 
not being inferior to state medical education 
is North Colombo Medical College (NCMC). 
Established in 1980, the college quickly 
became a lightning rod for controversy, facing 
relentless protests and systematic mudslinging.
Speaking to Jaffna Monitor, an alumnus of 
NCMC, now an eminent professor abroad 
who wished to remain anonymous, recounted 
their experiences. "Just as SAITM students 
were labeled 'fake degree buyers,' we too 
were subjected to similar slurs. Our college 
was vilified and used as a scapegoat for every 
protest movement. The JVP even bombed 
our campus in 1988, and the Premadasa 
government subsequently nationalized the 
institution. The scale of character assassination 
we endured was unprecedented—Sri Lanka 
had never witnessed anything like it."
Despite such adversity, NCMC alumni have 
risen above the challenges to prove their 
mettle. "Of the 800 students who graduated 
from NCMC, more than 50% are now highly 
respected physicians, consultants, professors, 
and even vice-chancellors, making their mark 
globally.
"If you look at Sri Lanka's medical universities 
and hospitals, you'll find our alumni 
occupying prominent roles across the 
country," the professor shared. Some notable 
alumni include:
Professor Chandanie Wanigatunge: A 
Professor of Pharmacology at the Faculty 
of Medical Sciences, University of Sri 
Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka.
Professor Udaya Ranawaka: Consultant 
Neurologist at Ragama Hospital.

Dr. Kishan de Silva: Consultant

"Our graduates are living proof that private 
medical education can produce professionals 
of the highest caliber and dispel the 
misconception that private medical students 
are merely degree buyers," the professor 
concluded.
The Culture of Deification Among Sri 
Lankan Medical Students
Local Medical students and doctors in 
Sri Lanka are not merely students or 
professionals," said Perniparaja Navarathnam, 
a long-time advocate of private medical 
colleges (PMCs) in Sri Lanka. "They are 
treated as demigods," he explained to Jaffna 
Monitor. "In a city like Jaffna, if you're a 
medical student, it's as though you've achieved 
everything in life. A student, just 19 years old, 
securing admission to a medical program is 
showered with immense respect and adulation, 
almost on par with that of a celebrity," he 
argued.
Navarathnam raised a thought-provoking 
question about societal attitudes: "How can 
a 19-year-old, showered with accolades and 
unquestioning admiration, be expected to 
grow meaningfully or evolve in life? This 
culture of deification stifles both individual 
development and the broader progress of the 
profession."
He elaborated further: "One who has enjoyed 
such adulation and privilege from a young 
age is naturally resistant to changes that might 
challenge the status quo. This is precisely why 
there is such strong opposition to private 
sector involvement in medical education—
they fear it will weaken their exclusive hold 
over the profession. But let me clarify," he 
added, "I don't paint every doctor or medical 
student with this brush. Unfortunately, 
though, I can confidently say that a majority 
hold this view."
A Nation's Well-Being: It Takes More 
Than Just Doctors
"This misplaced belief that the medical 
profession towers above all others has deeply 
entrenched itself in our society," remarked an 
expert. "Perhaps it's the visible and immediate 
impact doctors have on physical health that

fuels this myth. But let's be clear—this notion 
is far from the truth."
Another expert offered a provocative 
counterpoint. "A friend of mine, a brilliant 
civil engineer, "once remarked—though 
not widely accepted—that engineers likely 
save or impact the health of populations far 
more significantly than doctors. Think about 
it: clean water systems, safe infrastructure, 
disaster preparedness… these have a profound 
impact on public health." They continued, 
"And let's not overlook the critical role 
of mental health. Addressing the nation's 
psychological well-being might require an 
army of counselors and therapists, not just 
medical doctors."
Echoing these sentiments, Dr. Ruvan 
Weerasinghe, in one of his incisive articles, 
dismantled the idea that any single profession 
holds a monopoly on societal importance. 
He illuminated the often-overlooked yet 
vital contributions of lawyers, financiers, 
administrators, and educators. He went 
further, emphasizing the indispensable roles 
of philosophers, scientists, psychologists, 
sociologists, and even politicians—all 
intricately involved in shaping the long-term 
well-being of a nation.
Another advocate of private medical colleges 
(PMC) told Jaffna Monitor that doctors with 
foreign training and broader exposure often 
become proponents of private education. 
However, for obvious reasons, they can't 
openly voice their support. "In private 
discussions, many admit they've come to 
appreciate the value of diverse educational 
systems. But for others, the mindset remains

unchanged," he explained.
A classic example lies in figures like Prof. 
Carlo Fonseka, Prof. Nalin de Silva, and Dr. 
Rajitha Senaratne. They were vocal critics of 
the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC) 
and prominent speakers at public rallies 
organized against it. Yet, over two decades 
later, their views shifted dramatically. Today, 
they openly support the establishment of 
private medical colleges.
Prof. Carlo Fonseka even remarked that 
NCMC serves as a solid example of how 
the private sector can produce high-quality 
medical practitioners. "But," Navarathnam 
added with a wry smile, "not everyone gets 
enlightened."
Limited Availability of Biology Stream in State 
Schools
An educationalist told Jaffna Monitor that 
many students face an uphill battle just to 
gain admission to the Biology stream for 
Advanced Level (A/L) studies, a crucial step 
for pursuing medical education. The reason? 
Limited access. According to the Ministry of 
Education's 2021 School Census, out of 10,146 
state schools in Sri Lanka, only 1,011 schools 
(classified as 1AB) offer the Biology stream. 
This glaring gap leaves countless aspiring 
medical students unable to even meet the 
basic qualifications set by the UGC and SLMC, 
dashing their dreams before they can even 
begin.
International School Students: Stranded by the 
System?
Sri Lanka's education system is a fascinating 
paradox, an expert told Jaffna Monitor. While 
traditional schools face numerous challenges, 
a new type of institution has emerged: 
international schools. Once catering to a niche 
market, these schools have now become a 
significant part of the country's educational 
landscape.
However, this growth is overshadowed by 
stark inequalities. Rural schools continue to 
grapple with inadequate resources and teacher 
shortages, while urban areas experience a 
surge in demand for international education. 
This demand is driven by aspirations for global 
competitiveness but remains largely accessible 
only to the affluent.
Despite these disparities, international schools 
are flourishing. As of July 2023, an impressive 
421 such schools were registered in Sri Lanka, 
with nearly a quarter of a million students 
enrolled. These institutions equip students 
with globally recognized qualifications, yet 
these very credentials often become a barrier 
to accessing local universities.
Consider this: Sri Lanka invests in cultivating 
a generation of globally-minded students, only 
to deny them entry into its state universities. 
Admission to these universities is based solely 
on local examinations, forcing international 
school graduates to choose between pursuing 
higher education abroad or seeking the limited 
options offered by private institutions—if 
available.
This disconnect has led to a worrying "brain 
drain," experts told Jaffna Monitor. Sri Lanka 
risks losing its brightest minds to other 
countries simply because its education system 
is not designed to accommodate the talent it 
produces.
"It's a perplexing situation," an expert 
remarked. "If Sri Lanka wants to retain its 
homegrown talent and truly capitalize on the 
international school boom, this puzzle must be 
solved. Otherwise, what's the point of having 
these institutions?
An anti-Private Medical College (PMC)

activist told Jaffna Monitor, "If these so-
called 'rich' students can afford international 
schools, why can't they pay for private higher 
education?" Critics, however, were quick 
to counter with a heartfelt argument: "First 
of all, not all international school students 
are 'rich kids.' Many come from humble 
backgrounds, with hardworking parents who 
sacrifice everything to give their children a 
better future. What's so wrong with wanting 
your child to have an international-standard 
education in English?"
One critic shared a moving story: "An auto 
driver I know enrolled his only daughter in 
a prestigious international school. He once 
told me, 'I'll do whatever it takes—work 24 
hours a day if I must—so my daughter can 
have the education I never had.' These are not 
the 'privileged elite' people imagine—they are 
parents who dream big for their children."
He then posed a compelling question: "If 
a top-performing Biology student from an 
international school excels in their London 
A-Levels, why can't they pursue medicine 
locally, even with self-funding? And why is it 
such a problem to let private medical colleges 
operate in Sri Lanka? Are we really crying 
over international schools while denying these 
students the chance to achieve their dreams?"
For instance, a student excelling in the 
London A-Levels can pursue medicine almost 
anywhere in the world – except in Sri Lanka, 
where private medical colleges are non-
existent. This policy anomaly not only restricts 
individual aspirations but also potentially 
deprives the nation of valuable human capital.
An advocate for PMCs called this policy 
"utter foolishness or arrogance," adding, 
"Allowing international curricula for primary 
and secondary education without a pathway 
for tertiary education is a blatant oversight. 
This forces a massive outflow of foreign 
exchange, which could otherwise strengthen 
Sri Lanka's education system." The advocate 
emphasized, "If you permit international 
curricula for school education, why not for 
higher education? Without this, the system is 
fundamentally flawed."
Hassan Hussain: A Case in Point
Hassan Hussain, a Lyceum International 
School alumnus, soared to new heights 
in 2010, securing four A grades in his 
Cambridge A-Levels, including As in Physics 
and Chemistry. This stellar achievement, 
coupled with his prowess in Biology and 
Mathematics, catapulted him into the spotlight 
as the batch topper. His academic brilliance 
unlocked doors to prestigious universities 
like Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford, and 
Harvard, where he could pursue his passion 
for medicine or engineering with generous 
scholarships.
Despite these international opportunities, 
Hussain opted to remain in Sri Lanka and 
pursue his medical education at SAITM 
(South Asian Institute of Technology and

Medicine). At the time, SAITM was a newly 
established private medical college and the 
sole option for students seeking to study 
medicine domestically. 'I stayed because my 
parents wished for me to remain close to 
home,' Hussain explained, 'but this decision 
came with significant challenges.'
"Despite his remarkable academic 
achievements and undeniable talent, Hussain 
faced a wave of criticism and doubt. 'We were 
accused of buying our degrees,' he shared, 
the sting of those accusations still palpable 
in his voice. 'It was so painful to hear those 
words,' he confessed. Today, Hussain serves 
as a Registrar in General Medicine at Sri 
Jayewardenepura Hospital, and he is awaiting 
his final exams to become a fully qualified 
specialist.
If There's a Start, There Must Be a Way 
Forward
"Sri Lanka has sown the seeds of international 
education, but it has failed to nurture the 
harvest. These bright young minds, cultivated 
in the fertile soil of international schools, 
are left to wither without a clear pathway to 
higher education," he lamented. "The lack of a 
structured pathway for tertiary education is a 
grave injustice." "If there's a start, there must 
be a way forward—otherwise, there shouldn't 
be a start at all," he told Jaffna Monitor.
Brain Drain and Dollar Drain
An economic expert shared a fascinating 
yet alarming insight during a conversation 
with Jaffna Monitor: "Did you know that 
approximately 25% of Sri Lanka's spending 
on imports goes toward fuel? This significant 
portion is understandable, given the country's 
lack of domestic fuel resources. While fuel 
imports are expected, the next major expense 
might surprise you: milk powder. Sri Lanka 
spends around $300 million annually on 
importing this dietary staple.
But perhaps the most shocking revelation

is the third biggest expense: education. The 
country is hemorrhaging foreign exchange to 
fund overseas education for its students," he 
explained. "The money spent on education 
abroad actually exceeds Sri Lanka's entire 
national education budget," he emphasized.
Despite this troubling trend, no government 
has taken concrete steps to address it. "Not 
one administration has made any serious 
effort to stop this drain of funds," he lamented. 
While the government struggles to allocate 
sufficient resources to schools and universities, 
families are spending billions to send their 
children abroad for education. "This is making 
a mockery of our education system," he 
remarked.
Transnational Education: A Slap on the 
Face of Sri Lanka's Higher Education 
System
Transnational Education (TNE) programs 
offer students the opportunity to earn 
internationally recognized qualifications 
without leaving their home country. Delivered 
through partnerships between local and 
foreign universities, these programs promise 
global standards paired with local accessibility. 
However, for Sri Lanka, the rising popularity 
of TNE programs is a damning reflection of 
the country's short-sighted higher education 
policies, an educationalist told Jaffna Monitor. 
"It's a glaring reminder of how the system 
has failed to evolve and meet the needs of its 
students," she added.
A Nation Leaning on TNE
Sri Lanka has become a key player in the 
global TNE landscape, driven largely by the 
inadequacies of its local higher education 
system. Recent data from the British Council 
Sri Lanka (August 2024) reveals that Sri Lanka 
ranks second globally—just behind China—
in sending students to the United Kingdom 
for TNE programs. During the academic 
year 2022–2023 alone, 53,915 Sri Lankan 
students were enrolled in UK TNE programs. 
Over a five-year period from 2018 to 2023, 
enrolments increased by 50%, with an average 
annual growth rate of 17% since 2020.
An economist speaking to Jaffna Monitor 
highlighted the striking comparison: "Sri 
Lanka's population is just a fraction of China's, 
yet it ranks second only to China and accounts 
for a staggering 10% of all global TNE 
enrolments in the UK." This reveals not only 
the high demand for higher education but also 
the lack of accessible options within Sri Lanka.
Why TNE Is Booming
The growth of TNE can be attributed to the 
significant challenges Sri Lankan students face 
in pursuing higher education locally. With 
limited seats, fierce competition, and a lack of 
diversity in available programs, many students 
are compelled to look abroad—or toward TNE 
programs—for opportunities. For families, 
these programs offer hope: a chance for their 
children to access world-class education 
without the upheaval of moving abroad.
At What Cost?
However, this hope comes with a hefty price 
tag. As one economist pointed out, TNE 
programs are draining millions of dollars from 
Sri Lanka's economy. Families are pouring 
significant amounts of foreign currency into 
these programs to secure a better future for 
their children—funds that could otherwise 
be invested in improving the country's own 
higher education system.
The High Cost of Foreign Medical 
Education: A Wake-Up Call for Sri 
Lanka

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
23
An advocate for private medical colleges 
(PMCs) revealed to Jaffna Monitor some eye-
opening statistics about Sri Lanka's reliance 
on foreign medical education. "The Sri Lanka 
Medical Council (SLMC) conducts the ERPM 
Examination twice a year, with approximately 
500–700 students sitting for the exam in each 
session. This means at least 1,200 Sri Lankan 
students annually complete foreign medical 
degrees and return home," they explained.
Breaking down the numbers, they elaborated: 
"The average course fee for a medical 
degree abroad starts at a minimum of LKR 
15 million per student. And that's just the 
tuition. It doesn't include additional costs 
for accommodation, food, travel, and other 
expenses incurred over the typical five-year 
duration of a medical program. Parents often 
make repeated visits, further driving up costs."
To put this into perspective, an economist told 
Jaffna Monitor that over the past five years, Sri 
Lanka has lost no less than USD 250 million 
solely on tuition fees for foreign medical 
degrees. "When you factor in other expenses 
like accommodation, travel, and living costs, 
the total outflow is staggering," they added.
This massive drain of foreign exchange, they 
argued, underscores a serious economic 
challenge for the country. "It's not just about 
individual families bearing these costs—it's 
about a nation losing critical resources that 
could have been invested in strengthening our 
local education system, particularly medical 
education."
This trend not only reflects the challenges 
facing Sri Lanka's economy but also fuels 
the country's growing brain drain—a 
phenomenon where skilled individuals 
leave their home country in pursuit of better 
opportunities abroad. For Sri Lanka, this is 
particularly evident in the field of medicine, 
with thousands of students seeking education 
overseas. UNESCO reported 29,000 Sri 
Lankan enrollments in foreign universities in 
2020, a number expected to exceed 32,000 by 
2027.
The financial toll is staggering. Tuition 
fees and living expenses for these students 
collectively cost the country an estimated $1 
billion annually, according to ICEF Monitor. 
But the impact goes far beyond economics. 
This exodus disrupts family and social 
structures and hampers the nation's ability to 
foster innovation and development, as many 
students choose not to return, opting instead 
to build their futures abroad.
High-Value Loans: A Pathway to Medical 
Education
One of the most serious allegations often 
leveled against private medical students is 
the perception that they are "rich kids" and 
that establishing private medical universities 
in Sri Lanka would make medical education 
unaffordable for the majority. However, 
economists suggest a viable solution to address 
this concern.
Speaking to Jaffna Monitor, experts propose 
that with proper regulations and oversight, 
banks in Sri Lanka could offer high-value, 
long-term loans to aspiring medical students. 
These loans would be based on the strong 
financial prospects associated with obtaining 
a globally recognized medical degree. Once 
students complete their education and secure 
full registration, they are almost guaranteed 
employment opportunities, either in Sri 
Lanka or abroad. This enables them to repay 
the loans over time without undue financial 
burden.
"This model," an economist pointed out, "has 
already been successfully implemented in 
countries like the UK, ensuring that financial

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
24
constraints do not prevent deserving students 
from pursuing their dreams of becoming 
doctors."
They further explained, "If Sri Lanka adopts a 
similar approach, it could revolutionize access 
to medical education, breaking down barriers 
and providing opportunities for students 
from all social and economic backgrounds to 
achieve their ambitions."
Such a shift, they argued, could not only 
address the shortage of local medical 
education opportunities but also create a 
more inclusive system that empowers the next 
generation of Sri Lankan doctors.
Sri Lanka's Prescription for Economic Growth: 
Private Medical Colleges
One of Sri Lanka's potential remedies for 
its economic challenges could lie in the 
establishment of private medical colleges 
(PMCs)," an economist told Jaffna Monitor. 
Reflecting on the recent economic meltdown, 
the economist argued that the government 
should seriously consider PMCs as a 
transformative solution to the crisis.
"Given the international acclaim Sri Lanka's 
education system enjoys, the introduction 
of PMCs would undoubtedly attract foreign 
students, including a significant number from 
the extensive Tamil diaspora," they stated. 
"This initiative could generate substantial 
revenue, inject much-needed vitality into the 
local economy, and elevate our country to a 
higher level of development," they emphasized.
Regional Trends in Foreign Medical 
Education
They point out, for instance, that neighboring 
countries like India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and 
even European nations such as Belarus have 
successfully attracted significant numbers of 
foreign students to their medical programs, 
thereby boosting their economies. Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that private medical schools 
in India cater to a substantial number of 
international students. Similarly, Malaysia has 
positioned itself as a premier destination for 
medical education.
Experts say a remarkable example Sri Lanka 
could consider emulating is Bangladesh. 
Government medical colleges in Bangladesh 
reserve 200 seats specifically for foreign 
candidates, while private medical colleges 
allocate 45% of their seats to international 
students. This policy, coupled with the fact that 
medical education is conducted in English, 
has enabled Bangladesh to accommodate 
approximately 5,000 foreign students, 
primarily from India, pursuing medical studies 
in the country. Experts estimate that these 
students contribute an average of USD 20,000 
per year in fees, generating a substantial USD 
100 million annually for the Bangladeshi 
economy.
In a conversation with Jaffna Monitor, 
economists highlighted that "Sri Lanka enjoys 
a far better reputation in education than 
Bangladesh. If a country like Bangladesh can 
attract 5,000 foreign students annually, Sri 
Lanka could draw even more with its potential 
for well-structured and efficiently managed 
private medical colleges (PMCs)."
They emphasized that if PMCs were to be 
established in Sri Lanka, the natural medium 
of instruction would be English. "Currently, 
many students choose countries like China 
and Russia for medical studies, where they 
are required to learn the local language. 
By offering medical education in English, 
Sri Lanka could position itself as a highly 
attractive destination for international 
students. This, in turn, would generate a 
substantial economic boost for the country."

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com

Economists argue that Sri Lanka could 
generate significant revenue even if medical 
schools initially set tuition fees lower than 
those of competing countries, from USD 
12,000 to USD 20,000 per year. For instance, 
with an annual intake of 500 foreign students 
and an average tuition fee of USD 15,000, the 
country could still earn approximately USD 
7.5 million annually from tuition fees alone in 
the initial stages.
They further elaborated that tuition fees are 
just one aspect of the economic potential. 
These students would also spend on 
accommodation, food, transportation, and 
other living expenses, injecting additional 
income into the local economy. Moreover, 
the areas surrounding the PMCs could thrive, 
transforming into modern urban centers, as 
seen in other nations that have successfully 
adopted this model.
Sri Lanka's Unique Appeal for Medical 
Education
In a conversation with Jaffna Monitor, 
economists highlighted several factors that 
could make Sri Lanka an attractive destination 
for foreign students pursuing medical 
education. The country's rich cultural heritage, 
stunning natural beauty, and warm, hospitable 
environment are major draws. Iconic 
attractions such as Sri Lanka's renowned tea 
plantations, ancient cities, and diverse wildlife 
add to its appeal. Furthermore, the relatively 
low cost of living compared to Western 
countries makes Sri Lanka a financially 
attractive option for international students.
From Ghost Towns to Thriving Hubs: 
The Power of Educational Institutions
"Education has the power to transform 
not just the student but the very fabric of a 
community," an economist eclared to the 
Jaffna Monitor. "Look at College Station, 
Texas! Before Texas A&M University arrived 
in 1876, it was practically a ghost town. Now, 
it's a bustling city of over 120,000, with a 
diverse economy fueled by the university."
He continued, "But we don't need to look to 
the USA for inspiration. Manipal, India, was 
once a sleepy village. Then came the Manipal 
Academy of Higher Education, and boom! It

became a vibrant hub synonymous with top-
notch education and a buzzing student life. 
Infrastructure blossomed, businesses thrived, 
and the quality of life soared."
Another economist chimed in, "Why look so 
far? We have our own Malabe! Once a quiet 
suburb of Colombo, it's now a sought-after 
area, thanks to institutions like SAITM, SLIIT, 
CINEC, and Horizon Campus. Housing, 
businesses, and infrastructure exploded. 
Property values skyrocketed!"
The economists were practically bursting 
with optimism! They painted a vivid picture 
of Sri Lanka's future, where world-class 
PMCs wouldn't just educate doctors and 
act as powerful magnets for progress. These 
institutions, they argued, would breathe new 
life into their surrounding communities, 
sparking economic growth and development 
and propelling these areas to new heights.
The Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, estimated at 
approximately 887,000 globally, represents a 
significant opportunity for private medical 
colleges (PMCs) in Sri Lanka. Concentrated 
in countries such as Canada and the United 
Kingdom, this diaspora has achieved 
considerable financial success and maintains a 
strong desire to contribute to the development 
of their homeland. Experts suggest that this 
could create substantial demand for medical 
education in Sri Lanka, particularly in Tamil-
speaking regions.
If PMCs are allowed to establish themselves 
in these areas, they could offer a compelling 
alternative for the younger generation of the 
diaspora to pursue medical studies closer to 
their cultural roots. Not only would this be 
a cost-effective option compared to Western 
institutions, but it would also provide an 
opportunity to reconnect with their heritage. 
For example, a 5-year medical program in the 
West typically costs between USD 400,000 
and USD 550,000. In contrast, a comparable 
program in Sri Lanka could be offered at less 
than half that cost—or even lower—making it 
an attractive choice, an economist told Jaffna 
Monitor.

A Sri Lankan-born Canadian 
businessman, in a conversation 
with the Jaffna Monitor, shared 
his vision of contributing to 
his Native place, Mullaitivu. 
"Imagine," he enthused, "a 
thriving medical college in 
Mullaitivu, a district still 
recovering from the scars of war. 
It would be transformative! Not 
just for the students, but for the 
entire region."
He spoke with heartfelt passion. "My son 
studied medicine in Canada," he explained, 
"but wouldn't it be incredible if my grandson 
could pursue his medical dreams right here, 
close to his roots, in a world-class institution? 
If permitted, these PMCs could be the seed 
that blossoms into a whole education hub, 
attracting talent and investment from around 
the globe, and ultimately making Sri Lanka a 
global economic and education powerhouse."
Ensuring Quality in Private Medical 
Education: A Roadmap for Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka's healthcare system is in a state of 
crisis, exacerbated by an alarming exodus of 
medical professionals. Over 2,000 doctors—
representing 10% of the country's medical 
workforce—have left the country since early 
2022, driven by the economic downturn and a 
lack of opportunities. According to Ministry of 
Defence data, 477 doctors and 125 consultants 
migrated abroad in 2023 alone, with only one 
doctor returning for every four who leave. 
This exodus includes not only general medical 
officers but also specialized consultants, 
surgeons, and anesthesiologists, leaving critical 
gaps in the healthcare system. Many doctors 
on long-term foreign leave have no intention 
of returning, while others depart without 
notifying the Ministry of Health.
The impact of this talent drain is felt most 
acutely in rural hospitals, where resources 
were already stretched thin. Medical insiders 
revealed to Jaffna Monitor that some facilities 
now operate with as few as three doctors, 
tasked with caring for populations exceeding 
75,000. These shortages have pushed rural 
hospitals to the brink of collapse, leaving 
underserved communities vulnerable to rising 
mortality rates and a sharp decline in overall 
health outcomes.
Compounding the issue is the scarcity of 
essential medications and limited capacity 
for vital laboratory tests, further eroding 
the quality of care. "The situation is dire," an 
expert told Jaffna Monitor, highlighting the 
urgent need for sustainable interventions to 
stabilize the system.
While Sri Lanka boasts 1.19 doctors per 1,000 
people, according to 2021 World Bank data—
higher than regional peers like India (0.7) and 
Bangladesh (0.7)—it still lags behind nations 
such as Malaysia (2.2) and Australia (4.1). On 
paper, these figures may seem sufficient, but 
they fail to account for the uneven distribution 
of medical personnel and the increasing 
demand for healthcare services.
The Ministry of Health's Annual Health 
Bulletin 2021 reported 102 medical officers per 
100,000 people, servicing 2,352 hospitals and

![p027_i1.jpg](images_out/004_cover_story/p027_i1.jpg)

1,170 registered private medical institutions. 
This supply is insufficient to meet the goals 
outlined in Sri Lanka's National Health 
Strategic Master Plan (2016–2025), which 
emphasizes expanding preventive care services 
and increasing the availability of skilled 
healthcare professionals.
Sri Lanka's Healthcare Crisis: Bold Decisions 
Needed
Sri Lanka's healthcare crisis demands urgent 
and decisive action. An expert speaking to 
Jaffna Monitor asserted that the time for 
half-measures has passed. Faced with a mass 
exodus of doctors and a crippled economy, 
the nation must confront a pivotal choice: 
either significantly increase the intake of state 
medical students or embrace the establishment 
of private medical institutions.
With the construction of new state universities 
nearly impossible under current financial 
constraints, the expert advocated for a 
pragmatic solution. "Setting aside egos and 
allowing private medical universities to 
flourish is the only viable path forward," she 
stated. This, she explained, is the fastest and 
most realistic way to address Sri Lanka's 
critical shortage of doctors.
However, implementing private medical 
colleges (PMCs) must be handled with care, 
warned an advocate for PMCs. "We cannot 
overlook concerns about quality control, 
ethical practices, and fears of profit-driven 
motives taking precedence over patient care," 
he told Jaffna Monitor.
The advocate stressed the need for a robust 
regulatory framework. "Without stringent 
accreditation standards and transparent 
oversight mechanisms, the integrity of medical 
education could be compromised. PMCs must 
uphold the highest educational and ethical 
standards to gain public trust and fulfill their 
purpose."
Accessibility was another crucial issue he 
highlighted. "PMCs cannot become exclusive 
sanctuaries for the privileged. To truly succeed, 
they must create opportunities for talented 
students from all socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Affordability and inclusivity must be at the 
core of this initiative," he emphasized.
Ultimately, the advocate expressed optimism 
about the transformative potential of PMCs. 
"They have the power to fill critical gaps in 
our healthcare system, but this transformation 
must be equitable. PMCs should not only 
address the doctor shortage but also contribute 
to a fairer, more inclusive healthcare 
landscape," he concluded.
The expert also emphasized the importance 
of safeguards to ensure the success of private 
medical universities. "Rigorous monitoring 
and evaluation are essential to maintain high 
standards. This goal is entirely achievable with 
the right political will," she insisted.
The expert recommended a standardized 
examination for all private medical students 
to address potential opposition from 
organizations like the Government Medical 
Officers' Association (GMOA) and state 
medical students. This examination would 
be similar to the ERPM (Examination for
