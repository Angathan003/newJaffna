Monitor Memo
J
affna residents are facing a new kind of 
nuisance. Much like legendary comedian 
Goundamani’s lament in Mannan, where he 
quipped, "ehl;Ly ,e;j njhopyjpgu;fs; 
njhy;iy jhq;fKbayg;gh! Gz;zhf;F 
tpf;fpwtd;> Fz;Lrp tpf;fpwtd; vy;yhk; 
njhopyjpguhk;!" (“This country is unbearable 
with these so-called businessmen! Even a guy 
selling cattle feed and another selling gunny 
bags now claim to be entrepreneurs!”)—today, 
Jaffna folks are echoing a similar sentiment: 
“This country is unbearable with these 
YouTubers!”
A source jokingly remarked, “If you trip and 
fall in Jaffna, chances are you’ll be ‘Touch 
and Lift’-ed by a YouTuber before you even 
hit the ground.” The region has witnessed an 
explosion of self-proclaimed content creators, 
where owning a smartphone seems to be 
the only qualification needed to become a 
“YouTube social worker.”
Many of these YouTubers portray themselves 
as champions of the downtrodden, producing 
half-baked, tear-jerking charity videos. 
However, sources reveal that some of these 
so-called “social activists” have turned charity 
into a lucrative business—collecting hefty 
donations from generous diaspora Tamils, 
giving away a fraction to the needy, and 
using the rest to fund their own extravagant 
lifestyles. From flashy bikes and cars to the 
latest iPhones, some “helpers” seem to be 
helping themselves a little too much. As one 
observer quipped, “They’re not just lifting the 
poor; they’re lifting their own bank balances 
too!”
Recently, a so-called YouTuber with lakhs of 
subscribers found himself at the receiving 
end of public outrage. Known for his “charity 
work,” his actions had long been questionable. 
But one incident pushed Jaffna residents over 
the edge.
This YouTuber visited the home of a poor 
schoolgirl who had scored 1A and 2Bs in her 
A/L exams. Coming from an underprivileged 
background, she had already faced enough 
struggles. But what happened next left Jaffna 
fuming.
Under the guise of offering aid, he arrived at 
YouTubers Galore: 
Jaffna’s New 
‘Entrepreneurs’ 
– Some Uplift the Poor, 
Others Just Lift!

her house late at night. When she refused to 
come outside, saying, "They’ll record a video… 
I don’t want to be filmed." The YouTuber was 
caught sneering on camera:
"Won’t she even show up for the video? Who 
does she think she is—Aishwarya Rai?"
This wasn’t his first display of insensitivity. In 
previous videos, he and his companions had 
openly mocked the way poor people pleaded 
for help on camera. In one video, he even 
acted out how poor people cry to gain their 
sympathy.
But this latest stunt crossed a line, and the 
people of Jaffna had had enough.
He was given an exclusive reality check—
by an angry mob! After his tasteless video 
surfaced, he attempted to visit the girl’s house 
again, this time for damage control. However, 
his damage control mission ended with the 
people controlling him! The enraged locals 
surrounded him, gave him a warm welcome, 
detained him on the spot, and handed him 
over to Ilavalai police.
This incident has sparked widespread outrage 
against exploitative YouTubers who chase 
views, subscribers, and money under the 
pretense of helping the poor. Many are now 
calling for stricter regulations on content 
creators, questioning whether social work 
should be reduced to a mere publicity stunt for 
online fame.
C
redible sources have informed 
Jaffna Monitor that 
the Tamil National Green 
Organization (TNGO), 
led by environmentalist P. 
Aingaranesan, is in discussions 
to form an alliance with the 
Tamil National People’s Front 
(TNPF) for the upcoming local 
government elections.
According to sources, negotiations 
between the two parties are 
currently underway. This 
development comes after the 
TNGO had earlier engaged in 
talks to join the Democratic 
Tamil National Alliance (DTNA), 
a coalition comprising nine parties. 
However, at the last minute, the party 
withdrew from those discussions, opting 
instead to explore a possible alignment with 
the TNPF.
Despite these reports, neither the TNGO nor 
the TNPF has officially confirmed or denied 
the alliance at the time of writing. Further 
updates on the ongoing negotiations are 
expected in the coming days.
