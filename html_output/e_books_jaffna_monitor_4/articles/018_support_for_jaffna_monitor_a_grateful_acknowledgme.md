The donations we receive are deeply valued, but they are not yet enough to fully 
sustain our work. We sincerely look forward to more support from our readers and 
well-wishers.
However, we want to make it clear—donations do not grant any influence over 
our editorial content. We cannot and will not write even a single word under 
obligation. Our commitment is to independent journalism, and our integrity 
is non-negotiable. If you respect this principle and still wish to support us, we 
encourage you to donate.
For those who wish to contribute, donations can be made to our official bank 
account. Please find our bank details below:
Thank you for being a part of our journey!
