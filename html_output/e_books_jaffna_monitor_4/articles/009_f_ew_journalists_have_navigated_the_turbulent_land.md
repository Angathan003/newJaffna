F
ew journalists have navigated the turbulent 
landscape of South Asia with the depth 
and nuance of Nirupama Subramanian. A 
veteran reporter, foreign correspondent, 
and editor, she has spent over three decades 
chronicling wars, political upheavals, and 
human stories with fearless dedication. From 
the battle-scarred villages of Sri Lanka’s civil 
war to the tense streets of Pakistan under 
military rule and the shifting power dynamics 
across India and its neighbors, her reporting 
has illuminated some of South Asia’s most 
complex conflicts.
As The Hindu’s correspondent in Sri Lanka 
(1995–2002), she covered the height of the 
war between the Sri Lankan state and the 
LTTE, capturing the struggles of civilians 
caught in the crossfire. Her book, Sri Lanka: 
Voices from a War Zone, remains a seminal 
work. In Pakistan (2006–2010), she reported 
on the rise of extremism, military rule, and 
the assassination of Benazir Bhutto—often 
working under surveillance. Her fearless 
dispatches earned her the Prem Bhatia Award 
(2008) for Excellence in Political Reporting 
and the Chameli Devi Jain Award (2009) for 
Outstanding Women Journalists.
Beyond conflict reporting, Subramanian has 
held senior editorial roles at The Hindu and 
The Indian Express, shaping coverage on 
India’s national security, foreign policy, and 
the wider South Asian region. She expanded 
her investigative lens into true crime with 
Murder on the Menu, a gripping account of 
the Saravana Bhavan murder case. A Nieman 
Fellow at Harvard, she has also contributed to 
Track II diplomacy efforts, fostering dialogue 
between India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
With an unparalleled career spanning 
war zones, political capitals, and editorial 
boardrooms, Nirupama Subramanian remains 
one of the foremost voices on South Asia 
today. Her insights are shaped by years on 
the ground—listening to people, questioning 
power, and telling stories that matter.
This is Jaffna Monitor’s exclusive interview 
with her.
How do you view the new government 
in Sri Lanka led by Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake? As someone who has 
extensively covered Sri Lanka, do you 
believe they are willing to share power 
with the Tamils or offer any form of 
settlement that could help heal the wounds 
of the three-decade-long civil war?
The election of AKD and the JVP marks 
a decisive break from the past, signaling a 
rejection of the old ruling elites. However, 
so far, his government has not made any 
major departures from previous governance 
practices. The budget revealed the constraints 
within which the government must operate, 
despite the election promise of renegotiating 
IMF conditionalities. They say election 
promises are made in poetry, but governance 
is in prose. AKD is following this pattern—he 
has no silver bullet.
In Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka, where the 
JVP/NPP made history by winning a plurality 
of seats—the first for a non-Tamil party—
expectations are high. So far, there have been 
no policy statements on Tamil issues, perhaps 
due to the government's preoccupation with 
the budget and economic concerns. However, 
the JVP cannot avoid this issue indefinitely.
There has been speculation about a new 
constitution, and whether or not it will include 
the 13th Amendment. JVP, which opposed it with 
violence at the time it was introduced as a result

of the Indian intervention, has not been very clear 
about its current positioning on the issue. A small 
clue was its absence in the India-Sri Lanka joint 
statement when AKD visited Delhi.
I am told it was omitted at the behest of the 
visiting side. The Amendment is the only 
instance in which the Sri Lankan polity 
has addressed Tamil political aspirations 
constitutionally. Its importance to India-Sri 
Lanka relations cannot be underestimated. 
You may have noted that Prime Minister 
Modi mentioned it in the press conference 
with President Dissanayake without using 
the words “13th Amendment.” His exact 
words were: “We hope that the Sri Lankan 
government shall fulfil the aspirations of the 
Tamil people and that they shall fulfil their 
commitment towards fully implementing the 
Constitution of Sri Lanka and conducting 
the Provincial Council Elections.” Provincial 
Councils are a provision of the 13th 
Amendment.
Tamils always looked to India or the UN to 
put pressure on the Sri Lankan government. 
In the new world order, where international 
institutions such as the UN may no longer 
carry the same weight as they once did—
particularly after their inability to stop 
Israel's genocidal war in Gaza— it is up to the 
government to act responsibly. Hopefully, the 
JVP will break away from its own past and do 
what is right.
The Adani Group has withdrawn 
from the wind power projects in 
Mannar, and Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi recently met with 
former Sri Lankan President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe in India. Do you see 
this as a sign of India's dissatisfaction 
with the new Sri Lankan government?

I don't know if that was a signal from Delhi 
to the AKD government, but that is certainly 
how Mr Wickremesinghe would like it to be 
interpreted in Sri Lanka.
You’ve extensively covered South Asia, 
particularly conflict zones. What do 
you see as the biggest challenge in 
reporting from areas deeply affected 
by political unrest and war?
The biggest challenge is maintaining the trust 
of readers and viewers by ensuring that you 
are not biased toward one side or against the 
other. Being objective is not merely about 
getting a quote from one side and another 
from the other. Objectivity means presenting 
facts without getting lost in misinformation 
and “counter” facts. Identifying the real facts 
is the hardest task for a journalist in an age 
where people ask, “Whose truth?” Even a 
venerable institution like the BBC is struggling 
to uphold this standard and maintain its 
reputation in its coverage of the Israeli 
invasion of Gaza.
Experts have suggested that India 
has lost some of its traditional allies 
in the region, with some attributing 
this to diplomatic missteps. How do 
you assess the current state of India's 
relations with its neighboring countries 
in the evolving geopolitical landscape? 
In your view, what is the trajectory of 
these relationships, and how are they 
progressing?
Leaving aside Pakistan which is a different 
case, India has never had an easy relationship 
with its neighbors. With Sri Lanka, the first 
major issue was Colombo’s disenfranchisement

of the Malaiha Tamils, followed by the anti-
Tamil riots and Tamil militancy in the north 
and India’s involvement in it.
With Nepal—the only country in the region 
with an open border with India—relations 
have fluctuated. You may recall that India 
imposed a blockade on Nepal in the 1980s 
during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure as prime 
minister. It was a terrible mistake, and 
history repeated itself in 2015-2016, just 
months after Modi took office and declared a 
Neighbourhood First policy.
With Bangladesh, safe havens for militant 
groups active in India’s northeast were a 
constant concern until Sheikh Hasina’s 
election in 2008. Her responsiveness to Indian 
security concerns was one of the key reasons 
Delhi maintained good relations with her.
Over the past two decades, China's growing 
competition with India for regional influence 
has added another layer of complexity to these 
dynamics.
We have to understand how India's rise and 
self-perception as a regional power began 
with its intervention in East Pakistan and 
the creation of Bangladesh—a turning point 
for India and the region. At this time, the 
excessive securitization of relations means that 
India engages primarily with those running 
the government in neighbouring countries, 
with little regard for what the people of that 
country think of their leaders. This is one 
reason why India is disliked in Bangladesh.
However, India's security remains a priority. It 
has to contend with two hostile nations, China 
and Pakistan, both of which covet Indian 
territory. India has fought four wars against 
Pakistan and one against China, with some 
situations in the last decade bringing it close to

another. These tensions are real and unlikely to 
disappear.
Furthermore, all said and done, India is a large 
country surrounded by smaller nations. While 
these countries seek economic connectivity 
with India, they also do not want to be 
overwhelmed by its influence. Naturally, they 
leverage their relations with China to keep 
India from getting too confident. 
You have extensively written about and 
covered the Sri Lankan civil war. In 
your view, what were the key factors 
that contributed to the defeat of the 
LTTE?
Conflicts don't arise out of thin air. The 
Sinhalese polity was short-sighted in its 
decision to disenfranchise the Malaiha Tamils 
and in enacting the Sinhala Only Act. The 
Tamil side made the mistake of believing 
that India would help them “do another 
Bangladesh” in Sri Lanka. The LTTE, in turn,

made the mistake of thinking it could force 
separation solely through war, to the exclusion 
of everything else. It ignored many political 
opportunities that its war had created—in 
1987, in 1994, and in 2002. The LTTE also lost 
the goodwill of Tamils in India, even in Tamil 
Nadu, when it assassinated Rajiv Gandhi.
With your focus on Sri Lanka, how 
do you assess the post-war progress 
in terms of reconciliation and 
development? What areas do you think 
still need significant attention?
I don't think the progress has matched anyone's 
expectations. Sri Lanka had to be dragged to 
the task of reconciliation and remains reluctant 
to address questions of missing persons, return 
of land, accountability, and justice. After 
the war ended, the government was more 
interested in projecting its military victory to 
consolidate itself politically.  
How do you assess the current 
political landscape of Tamil parties in 
the Northern and Eastern provinces? 
In your opinion, are they taking the 
right approach in addressing the 
rights and aspirations of the Tamil 
community?
Since the war ended in 2009, Tamil parties 
have struggled to adapt to the new reality- 
their politics had to find a post-war platform.  
What is their place in national politics? How 
do they find relevance in Colombo? What is 
the central Tamil issue today?
These questions seem to haunt Tamil 
politicians. Their uncertainty, compounded by 
the interventions of the Tamil diaspora, has 
alienated the Tamil people-especially the new 
generation that has now come of political age. 
The LTTE had been the self-appointed leader 
of the Tamil community, and willingly or 
unwillingly, the people accepted that.
With the LTTE no longer in the picture, 
people are searching for leadership. The 
economic crisis hit Tamil areas as hard, if 
not harder, than the south. It is unclear how 
much support Tamil politicians extended to 
the people in the north and east—how much 
solidarity they showed with those in Jaffna 
and Mannar—but what is certain is that some 
individuals, including students, expressed 
solidarity with the aragalaya.
Should Tamil parties have read the mood at 
the time instead of dismissing the aragalaya as 
a southern phenomenon? I don't presume to 
have the answers. Tamil political parties have 
endured immense challenges—targeted by 
the LTTE on one side and used and discarded 
by national political parties on the other. At 
times, they risked their lives to assert that the 
LTTE could not claim exclusive leadership of 
the Tamil people. Now, they are being forced 
to rethink their approach, and that is not 
necessarily a bad thing.
What challenges did you face from the 
Sri Lankan government, military, and 
the LTTE while reporting during the 
war years?
I faced some but it was not as horrific or as 
nightmarish as what journalists covering 
today's conflicts faced Those problems 
happened on one day and vanished the next, 
and to dwell on them serves no purpose now.
How do you reflect on the JVP uprising 
and the violence that occurred during

Jaffna Monitor

25
that period? How did it compare to the 
conflict involving the LTTE?
Both challenged the state and were put down 
brutally by the state, though it took longer with 
the LTTE because of the diplomatic costs.
In your view, was the LTTE war always 
destined to end in their defeat, or were 
there moments when you believed a 
different outcome was possible?
I never thought the LTTE would win the war. 
But I did not believe they would be routed 
to non-existence. I believed the war might 
produce a political opening, as it had done 
previously, either through a stalemate or the 
self-restraint of the government, and that a 
people exhausted by the decades of fighting 
and dislocation might have better agency to 
compel the myopic leader of the LTTE to 
accept that opening and work with it.
Tamil Nadu's leaders, over time, have 
had significant connections with 
the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Tamil 
struggle. How do you think these 
relationships shaped the trajectory of 
the conflict in Sri Lanka?
The patronage of the Tamil parties in TN 
was based on selfish political reasons. It did 
enormous harm to the Tamil people's cause in 
Sri Lanka.
You spent four years in Pakistan, an 
enemy country of India. What is your 
understanding of the country and its 
people? Did you feel safe while living 
there?
I never felt unsafe living in Pakistan. I made 
many friends, whose friendships I still cherish 
today. While I sensed the hostility of the 
Pakistani state toward my presence, the people 
I met were always warm, hospitable, and 
friendly.
The interview with LTTE 
co-founder Ragavan will 
be published in the next 
issue due to unforeseen 
circumstances.
