redible sources have told Jaffna Monitor 
that two out of the three NPP MPs elected 
from the Jaffna electoral district are feeling 
increasingly frustrated with their party.
In the last election, the NPP secured three 
seats in Jaffna: Karunananthan Ilankumaran, 
a heavyweight in the CEB trade union and a 
longtime JVP activist; Dr. S. Bavananda Rajah, 
the former Deputy Director of the Teaching 
Hospital; and Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy, a 
former school principal turned politician.
Additionally, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, the 
NPP’s Jaffna district chief organizer and a 
veteran JVP figure from Nuwara Eliya, entered 
Parliament through the national list and 
was rewarded with the Minister of Fisheries 
portfolio.
Now, here’s where things get murky. While it is 
expected that a JVP stalwart like Chandrasekar 
would receive his due, sources claim that the 
ruling camp is showering all its attention on 
Karunananthan Ilankumaran, a JVP activist, 
while systematically sidelining and ignoring 
the other two MPs, who have no direct ties 
to the JVP. It’s as if Bavananda Rajah and 
Jeyachandramoorthy have been reduced to 
mere political wallpaper—technically present, 
yet completely overlooked.
JVP’s Masterstroke or a Political Monopoly?
Although the NPP presents itself as a coalition, 
the JVP remains its undisputed backbone. 
Critics have long accused the JVP of using the 
NPP as a cosmetic rebrand to erase its violent 
past while ensuring that only JVP members 
climb the political ladder. The situation in 
Jaffna seems to confirm this suspicion, with 
non-JVP MPs being left in the cold while their 
counterparts enjoy the limelight.
