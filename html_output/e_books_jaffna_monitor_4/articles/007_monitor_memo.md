n what can only be described as the rarest 
of rare moments of making political sense, 
Jaffna MP and Tamil National People’s Front 
(TNPF) leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam 
has sounded the alarm for Tamil political 
parties in Sri Lanka’s north and east. Speaking 
to The Hindu, he declared that Tamil 
parties have no choice but to consolidate 
their presence in Parliament if they wish 
to effectively challenge the Anura Kumara 
Dissanayake-led government and assert the 
rights of the Tamil people.
“The Tamil people wanted to teach all 
traditional Tamil nationalist parties, including 
us, a lesson… our vote share nearly halved. 
If we don’t pick up the pieces and see the 
writing on the wall, the next election will 
be disastrous… we must work together in 
Parliament,” Ponnambalam admitted, perhaps 
signaling a long-overdue political reality check.
Tamil Politics: A Self-Inflicted Wound?
Analyzing the brutal electoral performance 
of Tamil parties in the 2024 elections, 
Ponnambalam pinned the blame on what he 
called an “erosion” of Tamil nationalist politics.
“From 2010, after the civil war ended, and 
particularly after 2015, there has been a gap 
between the Tamil nationalist assurances given 
to our people during elections and what the 
parties actually practiced,” he noted.
In simpler terms, Tamil politicians promised 
the moon but barely delivered a streetlight.
And who does he hold responsible for 
this downfall? None other than the Tamil 
National Alliance (TNA), once the biggest 
political force among Tamils. According to 
Ponnambalam, the TNA “got used” by the

Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe 
administration (2015-2019), implying that the 
alliance was more comfortable playing along 
with Colombo’s political chessboard than 
actually pushing for Tamil aspirations.
JVP’s Surprising Evolution—Ponnambalam 
Takes Note
In a rather unexpected twist, Ponnambalam 
admitted that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna 
(JVP)—the leftist powerhouse of the ruling 
National People’s Power (NPP)—has 
undergone a notable transformation since 
2019.
“President Dissanayake rightly says racism has 
been a major problem in our country and has 
vowed to wipe it out. The rhetoric is welcome, 
but we need to see qualitative change in 
action,” he said, adding that mere words won’t 
erase decades of systemic discrimination.
He argued that deep-rooted racism in 
Sri Lanka "won’t just disappear" without 
fundamental structural changes. Still 
advocating for federalism, he stated: “The 
unitary state must go. The government must 
devolve power, be transparent with all Sri 
Lankans in the process, and assure them that 
federalism is not the same as separatism.”
TNPF’s ‘Rain of Labels’—A Hurdle to 
Political Unity?
However, political observers argue that before 
expecting other parties to work with the 
TNPF, Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam must 
first put his own house in order. Since the 
demise of the LTTE, it appears that the TNPF 
has taken on the role of "sole authority" in 
deciding who is a traitor and who is a martyr. 
According to critics, its spokespersons and 
supporters have been distributing these 
labels like temple prasadam—generously and 
without hesitation.
“If Ponnambalam truly wants Tamil parties to 
unite, he needs to put an end to this nonsense,” 
one analyst remarked. “How can he expect 
to engage with people he and his party have 
already branded as traitors?” he questioned.
Continuation from page 8
The irony of the situation is hard to miss. Dr. 
Bavananda Rajah, a well-respected doctor 
who previously worked at a prestigious 
private hospital, was earning a comfortable 
six-figure salary before entering politics. 
Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy, in addition to 
his government salary, ran a thriving English 
tuition center that provided him with a steady 
income. But those days of financial security 
are now a distant memory. While Sri Lankan 
MPs receive a generous salary and allowances, 
sources claim that NPP MPs are allowed to 
keep only LKR 80,000 per month, with the rest 
going to the party.
For professionals who were accustomed to 
significantly higher earnings, this drastic pay 
cut has been a bitter pill to swallow. One of 
the frustrated MPs reportedly confided in our 
source:  'ehd; ghu;j;jJ tpru; Ntiy. ehd; 
,Jf;F te;jpUf;f $lhJ."  ("I made a foolish 
mistake. I shouldn’t have gotten into this.")
At this rate, don’t be surprised if these 
MPs start offering private tuition on the 
side, discreetly consulting at hospitals, or, 
worse—considering resignation out of sheer 
frustration. After all, ideological commitment 
is one thing, but no one enjoys going broke 
in the process, a source confided to Jaffna 
Monitor.
