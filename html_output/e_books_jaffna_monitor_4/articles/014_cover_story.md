arguably the most controversial figure in Jaffna’s political 
arena. While mainstream Tamil political forces—despite 
their fierce rivalries—tend to move in the same ideological 
direction, Arun has chosen a different path, one that often

places him in direct opposition to Jaffna’s 
dominant narratives.
A vocal critic of Jaffna’s brand of Tamil 
nationalism, Arun is equally outspoken 
against the region’s entrenched caste hierarchy 
and socio-political norms. He serves as the 
convener of the Jaffna Civil Society Centre 
and the coordinator and leader of the Jaffna 
Periyar Study Circle and the Ambedkar 
People's Movement—organizations dedicated 
to challenging traditional caste structures and 
social injustices in Jaffna.
However, what makes him one of the most 
polarizing figures in Jaffna is his association 
with hardcore Sinhala nationalist forces. He 
serves as the Jaffna and Kilinochchi District 
President of the Mawbima Janatha Pakshaya 
(MJP)—a party known for its strong Sinhala 
nationalist ideology—and is also a Supreme 
Council member of Sarvajana Balaya, an 
alliance of Sinhala nationalist parties in which 
MJP plays a significant role.
Adding to the controversy, Arun recently 
announced his plan to erect statues of Periyar 
(Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy) and Dr. 
B.R. Ambedkar in Jaffna—a move that has 
infuriated hardcore Tamil nationalists, who 
have long despised Periyar for reasons best 
known to them.
For the majority of Jaffna-based Tamil media, 
Arun is persona non grata. He has been 
blacklisted, silenced, and branded a traitor—a 
man perceived as an ally of Sinhala nationalism 
in the heart of Tamil politics. But at Jaffna 
Monitor, we do not follow the herd.
We believe in doing journalism differently. 
Breaking through the unofficial media 
blackout, we sat down with Arun Siddharth 
for an in-depth conversation—to hear his side 
of the story, to understand his ideology, and to 
confront the controversies that surround him.
Why do you think Periyar is necessary 
for the Sri Lankan Tamil context? Some 
hardcore Tamil nationalists say that 
Periyar is the number one enemy of 
Eelam Tamils. What is your response to 
that? 
I recognize their nervousness about Periyar 
and his ideology. From their perspective, this 
apprehension is entirely logical because their 
definition of "Eelam Tamils" is restricted to the 
dominant caste Saiva Vellalars.
For centuries, these Tamil nationalists have 
enjoyed privileges inherited by birth—keeping 
people in bondage, exploiting their labor, 
subjecting Dalit women to sexual slavery, and 
forcing Dalit men into bonded labor. It is only 
natural that they oppose Periyar.
Moreover, rather than viewing Periyar as just 
an individual, if we see him as a symbol, his 
three core principles directly challenge these 
Tamil nationalists. The first is rationalism—
how can one be an ultra-Tamil nationalist 
while possessing even a shred of rationality? 
The second is social justice—one cannot truly 
advocate for social justice while remaining 
bound by caste, ethnic, linguistic, or religious 
biases. The third is self-respect—a Tamil 
nationalist with genuine self-respect would 
inherently reject a system that thrives on 
caste-based oppression, as true self-respect 
contradicts the very notion of subjugating 
others.
Furthermore, these Tamil nationalists are 
deeply patriarchal, embodying the very essence 
of oppressive patriarchy. Periyar, on the other 
hand, was a staunch advocate for women's 
liberation.
So yes, I completely understand their panic.

Are they opposing Periyar because they 
lack understanding of him, or are they 
opposing him with full awareness of his 
ideology?
The architects of Tamil nationalist ideology in 
Sri Lanka are fully aware of their actions and 
understand Periyar’s ideology well. However, 
their followers—driven more by rhetoric than 
by genuine understanding—oppose Periyar 
without truly grasping what he stood for.
In India, Tamil nationalism—shaped by the 
Justice Party, Periyar, social justice movements, 
and the Dravidian movement—was progressive, 
left-leaning, anti-patriarchal, and supportive 
of the oppressed. In Tamil Nadu, these 
values formed the very foundation of Tamil 
nationalism.
But in Sri Lanka, what is passed off as Tamil 
nationalism is a casteist, Saiva Vellalar-
dominated, patriarchal, and regressive 
ideology. It is ultra-right-wing, reactionary, 
and fundamentally opposed to social justice. 
True Tamil nationalism is supposed to fight 
oppression, but Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism 
has been built on oppression itself.
The elite caste leaders of this movement are 
not ignorant; they know exactly what they are 
doing. They realize that if the oppressed classes 
embrace a Tamil nationalism based on justice 
and equality, their fabricated, casteist version 
will collapse.
Meanwhile, Dalits—whose long history of 
systemic oppression has been deliberately 
erased—lack an understanding of their own 
past. This lack of awareness makes them 
vulnerable to being manipulated under the 
guise of Tamil nationalism.
Why do you align yourself with figures 
widely regarded as Sinhala nationalists, 
such as Dilith Jayaweera, Wimal 
Weerawansa, and Udaya Gammanpila, 
instead of advocating for a form of 
Tamil nationalism rooted in social 
justice that unites the oppressed against 
the falsehoods of mainstream Tamil 
nationalism?
The answer lies in a strategy inspired by 
leaders like B.R. Ambedkar and Periyar, who 
navigated oppressive systems with pragmatism 
to challenge dominant powers within their own 
communities.
During India’s freedom struggle, when Gandhi 
boycotted the First Round Table Conference in 
1930, Ambedkar chose to sit at the table with 
the British. Branded a traitor by nationalists, 
he stood firm. In his view, the independence 
Gandhi sought was not for Dalits but a 
handover of power from colonial rulers to 
upper-caste Hindus. In What Congress and 
Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables (1945), 
he wrote:
"The Congress is fighting for the freedom of the 
Hindus and not for the freedom of India. The 
freedom it is fighting for is the freedom to rule 
over India in the place of the British."
At the First Round Table Conference, he argued 
that political power for the Depressed Classes 
required constitutional safeguards, not reliance 
on the goodwill of oppressors:
"We feel that nobody can remove our 
grievances as well as we can, and we cannot 
remove them unless we get political power in 
our hands."
Similarly, Periyar, disillusioned with the 
Brahmin-dominated Congress, saw British rule 
as a lesser evil than Brahminical hegemony. In a 
1932 speech, he declared:

Jaffna Monitor

"If the British leave India, it will not mean 
freedom for us. It will mean the freedom of the 
Brahmins to oppress us more effectively. Under 
British rule, we have some chance to fight for 
our rights; under Brahmin rule, we will have 
none."
Both leaders understood that their primary 
oppressors were not just external forces but the 
entrenched elites within their own societies. 
They leveraged outside powers—the British—
not out of loyalty, but as a tactical necessity to 
disrupt internal hierarchies.
This is why, as an experiment, I engage with 
Sinhala factions—not out of ideological 
alignment, but as a strategic necessity. If 
aligning with them creates an opportunity to 
challenge caste oppression, why should we not 
consider it? I am very clear that for our Tamil 
Dalit community, the primary oppressors are 
the dominant Vellalar caste.
The same elite caste figures who accuse me 
of working with Sinhala nationalist forces 
have historically been allies of oppressive 
governments.
Look at Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, 
who now poses as the torchbearer of Tamil 
nationalism. His father, G.G. Ponnambalam, 
joined D.S. Senanayake’s government in 1948, 
serving as a minister while endorsing the 
Citizenship Act that stripped Indian Tamils of 
rights. The LTTE, too, allied with Ranasinghe 
Premadasa against the IPKF and later took 
crores to enforce the 2005 election boycott, 
paving Rajapaksa’s path to power.
If these elites could justify their deals with 
Sinhala forces, why is it treachery when Tamil 
Dalits explore a strategy to challenge our own 
oppressors?
You are aligning with Sinhala nationalists 
to oppose Vellalar dominance, which you 
consider your primary enemy. But doesn’t 
this undermine the Tamil nationalism that 
unites the oppressed and fights for their 
rights—the very Tamil nationalism that 
you acknowledge exists in Tamil Nadu? 
 
Who is my real enemy? It is the Vellalar-
dominated caste elite. Sinhala supremacists 
may also be our adversaries, but have Sinhala 
nationalists ever barred us from entering their 
homes? Have they ever denied us access to their 
wells? Have they ever practiced untouchability 
against us?
Even as enemies, they are willing to sit across 
the table and negotiate with me as an equal. 
They are ready to listen to my problems. But 
these Tamil caste elites continue to impose the 
same untouchability mentality.
Tamil nationalists constantly claim that "the 
Sinhalese treat us as second-class citizens." But 
they treat Dalits far worse, denying us even our 
most basic rights. If we classify our enemies 
into primary and secondary, then these Saiva 
Vellalar Tamil nationalists are our first and 
foremost enemies.
Critics argue that you have not genuinely 
experienced caste oppression and 
are merely exploiting the issue as a 
political tool. How do you respond to this 
allegation?
One does not need to be personally oppressed 
to speak out against caste discrimination. 
Periyar was not from an oppressed caste, yet 
he dedicated his life to dismantling the caste 
hierarchy. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar drew inspiration 
from Jyotirao Phule, who, despite not being a 
Dalit himself, fought against caste oppression 
and championed social justice. Even in global

history, figures like Abraham Lincoln, who 
was never enslaved, fought to abolish slavery. 
William Wilberforce, who was not Black, 
played a pivotal role in the abolitionist 
movement.
When people accuse me of raising caste 
oppression for political gain, my response 
is simple: Reducing this struggle to a mere 
political tool is dangerous. This is not just 
politics for me—this is my struggle. This is my 
history. This is the history of my ancestors.
Let me tell you about my history.
From the 1700s, for approximately 70 years, 
Sri Lanka was under Dutch colonial rule. 
During this period, a regional legal system 
known as the "Thesavalamai Law" was 
codified in 1707. The Thesavalamai Law 
applied exclusively to the Northern Province, 
which today consists of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, 
Mullaitivu, Mannar, and Vavuniya. It was 
drafted with the involvement of twelve Vellalar 
chieftains. Though formally codified by the 
Dutch, this was not a new law—it was merely 
the legalization of existing customs and 
traditions in the then-Jaffna peninsula.
This law explicitly legalized slavery, formally 
classifying four castes—Koviyar, Chandar, 
Pallars, and Nalavar—as slave castes. The 
eighth section of Thesavalamai explicitly used 
the term "male and female slaves," defining 
who was legally considered a slave, how they 
were to be treated, and what, if any, rights they 
possessed.
I belong to the Nalavar caste, one of the 
groups that were legally subjugated under this 
system.
The law reinforced a rigid caste-based 
hierarchy and institutionalized slavery 
within Tamil society. In the preamble of 
Thesavalamai, the Dutch Governor stated that 
the Dutch administration had not introduced 
new laws but had merely codified the customs 
and traditions that had existed for centuries, 
with the assistance of the twelve Vellalar 
chieftains. This means the Dutch were not the 
architects of caste oppression—they merely 
formalized a system that had already existed for 
generations.

A page from the Tēsaṉālamai, the traditional legal code of the Tamil community in northern Sri Lanka, explicitly detailing 
classifications, rights, and regulations concerning slaves, highlighting the existence of slavery within the legal framework of the time.
Thesavalamai imposed severe restrictions 
on these four castes. Education was legally 
denied to them, preventing any opportunity 
for social mobility. Land ownership was 
forbidden. Slaves were not allowed to own 
property or possessions—everything they had 
legally belonged to their master. They could 
only marry within their caste, reinforcing 
generational servitude. A slave’s wife and 
children were considered the legal property 
of their master. Our ancestors were not even 
given the right to name their own children. Our 
female ancestors were often subjected to sexual 
exploitation, sanctioned by this law.
And now, you ask me whether I have been 
affected by caste oppression.
Can you rewrite American history by erasing 
the injustices inflicted on Black Americans? 
If you did, would that be seen as an attack on 
White Americans?
A massive chunk of Sri Lankan Tamil caste 
history has been deliberately erased—wiped 
from collective memory. Just as the United 
States had racist laws like Jim Crow, which 
enforced racial segregation and disenfranchised 
Black citizens, Sri Lankan Tamils had their own 
oppressive legal system—Thesavalamai Law, 
which remained in effect for over 150 years.
How can you expect me to overlook this 
history?
As Dr. B.R. Ambedkar profoundly stated, "They

cannot make history who forget history."
Can I call you a broken relic, scarred and 
bleeding from the pages of history?
Exactly.
My grandfather was a toddy tapper, he was 
an extremely hardworking man. Yet, until 
1989, we did not even have a toilet of our 
own. When I questioned why a man like my 
grandfather, despite his relentless labor, could 
not afford something as basic as a toilet for his 
family, I came to understand the depths of the 
exploitation we endured.
While your grandfather had the privilege of 
education, mine was legally barred from it. And 
now, you turn around and ask, ‘Why don’t you 
just study and succeed? Everything is equal 
now.’
How is this equity? I am not talking about mere 
equality—I am talking about equity. This is 
exactly why reservations were introduced in 
India.
But here, in Sri Lanka, do we have any such 
system? Is there any reservation for us? How 
is it justifiable to compare a Vellalar student, 
whose ancestors had generations of education, 
to a student from my caste, whose ancestors 
were systematically denied the right to learn?
Don’t you think that the personal pain, 
anger, and grievances you carry from 
past injustices might blur your vision on a 
larger scale? Could this be what led you 
to align with extreme Sinhala forces?
Maybe. Recently, countries like Australia 
and Canada have officially apologized to 
Indigenous peoples for historical injustices. 
The Netherlands has acknowledged its role 
in slavery and other oppressive laws, stating, 
"We recognize our part in enacting oppressive 
laws, and we apologize for it." This is what true 
accountability looks like. Such actions help to 
heal deep-seated wounds.
However, to this day, the Vellalar elite in Sri 
Lanka refuse to acknowledge the historical 
injustices they inflicted upon us.
In 1931, under the recommendations of the 
Donoughmore Commission, Sri Lanka (then 
Ceylon) introduced universal adult suffrage, 
granting voting rights to all adults regardless of 
caste or gender. Before this, voting rights were 
predominantly limited to educated, upper-
caste men. Women and oppressed castes were 
systematically denied the right to vote.
There was massive opposition to this. And who 
opposed these inclusive reforms? It was the 
very Tamil leaders of that era—the predecessors 
of today’s so-called Tamil nationalists. Notably, 
G.G. Ponnambalam and other Tamil elites 
argued before the British that Dalits should 
not be granted voting rights. Ponnambalam 
even went so far as to say, "Do not throw pearls 
before swine," reflecting the utter disdain with 
which they viewed our community.
You have spoken extensively about your 
grandfather, who reportedly faced severe 
caste discrimination. Could you share 
more about his experiences and the caste 
oppression he endured?
My grandfather hailed from Kalla Kattuvan, a 
village in Chunnakam, Jaffna. The entire land 
in that village was owned by a single Vellalar 
landowner named Singa Mappanar. Historical 
records, known as Thombus, reveal that all 
the land was registered under the names of 
Vellalars. This was because Dalits were legally

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
53
prohibited from owning land under the 
Thesawalamai law.
The Vellala elites aligned themselves with 
successive colonial rulers—the Portuguese, 
the Dutch, and the British—to secure 
land ownership. They maintained cordial 
relationships with those in power to preserve 
their dominance.
My grandfather, along with his wife and ten 
children, lived on Singa Mappanar’s land. They 
poured their physical labor into cultivating and 
enriching the soil, making it fertile. Yet, they 
were not allowed to pluck even a single coconut 
that grew there. Their only means of sustenance 
depended on the landowner's charity; they 
received no formal wages.
Even the milk from the cows they tended had 
to be handed over to the landowner. If the 
landlord offered anything in return, it had 
to be accepted with folded hands. Their only 
compensation was the food they were given to 
eat.
For generations, the labor of Dalit people was 
ruthlessly exploited. The Vellalars maintained 
us as bonded laborers, building their economic 
prosperity on our suffering. They refrained 
from physical labor themselves, instead 
amassing wealth through our toil. This wealth 
granted them access to education, and the 
combination of wealth and education enabled 
them to capture political power.
Political power is deeply intertwined with 
wealth and education. Deprived of wealth, we 
were denied education. Lacking both, we were 
excluded from political power.
This social structure persists even today. If you 
look at those working as daily wage laborers, 
99.9% of them are Dalits. Can you find a single 
Vellalar working as a daily wage laborer? You 
cannot.
When was the practice of keeping Dalits 
as slaves abolished in Sri Lanka?
In 1833, the British Parliament enacted the 
Slavery Abolition Act, which came into effect 
on August 1, 1834. This legislation aimed 
to abolish slavery across the British Empire, 
including Ceylon. Until that date, the Vellala 
caste in Jaffna legally owned slaves, who were 
Dalits. I am a descendant of those enslaved 
ancestors, and I am fighting against the casteists 
who enslaved my forefathers.
Despite its formal abolition, the reality for 
many Dalits in Ceylon remained unchanged 
for years. The oppressors, long entrenched in 
socio-economic dominance, systematically 
concealed the abolition from their Dalit 
laborers. This deliberate suppression ensured 
that our ancestors continued to live and work 
as bonded laborers, unaware of their own 
emancipation.
It wasn't until 1957 that a meaningful legal 
intervention took place. The Sri Lankan 
government enacted the Prevention of Social 
Disabilities Act, making it a criminal offense 
to impose social disabilities on individuals 
based on their caste. This legislation—despite 
its shortcomings—granted all citizens the right 
to own property, receive an education, and seek 
employment without discrimination.
However, the path to true equality remained 
long and arduous. Even after this law was 
enacted, Dalits had to fight for years to exercise 
their basic rights. For instance, it wasn’t until 
the late 1960s that Dalits in Jaffna were allowed 
to enter certain temples.
Notably, in 1968, during the Maviddapuram 
Temple Entry Movement, low-caste Hindus 
faced violent resistance from high-caste Hindus 
when they attempted to enter the temple.
Some may argue that such blatant caste

discrimination is a relic of the past. While 
overt oppression has diminished, caste-based 
discrimination has evolved into more insidious 
forms. Take, for example. In Tellippalai Thurga 
Amman Temple, non-Vellalars are still barred 
from carrying the deity.
How is this discrimination enforced in a 
more “refined” manner?
The temple mandates that only members of 
its Hindu Youth Association are allowed to 
perform the ritual of carrying the deity. But 
if a Dalit attempts to join this association, 
they are subtly excluded through excuses and 
bureaucratic tactics. Thus, caste oppression has 
taken on a more discreet, modern form.
In contemporary Jaffna, caste discrimination 
manifests most prominently when Dalits aspire 
for upward mobility. When Dalits are engaged 
in traditional, labor-intensive occupations—
such as driving autos, working as mechanics, 
or performing daily wage labor—caste 
discrimination is not openly visible.
But the moment a Dalit becomes educated 
and competes with Vellalars in professional 
and academic spaces, caste-based barriers 
resurface in full force. A glaring example is 
the underrepresentation of Dalits in political 
spheres. To this day, there isn’t a single Dalit 
Member of Parliament from the Northern 
Province.
Is the Prevention of Social Disabilities 
Act, enacted in 1957, strong enough 
to protect against caste-based 
discrimination?
No, it remains one of the weakest laws in Sri 
Lanka. Although the government enacted it, 
they never ensured its proper enforcement.
Take a recent example: a caste-based violent 
incident in Vaddukoddai.
Instead of registering the case under the 
Prevention of Social Disabilities Act, the police 
classified it as an ordinary violent offense.
Through my fieldwork and firsthand evidence, 
it is clear that this was a caste-based crime. 
Yet, the police are neither trained to recognize 
caste-based violence nor even aware that this 
law exists.
The most shocking part? The maximum 
punishment under this law is just a few 
thousand rupees.
Now, compare this to India’s Scheduled 
Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Act, 1989. Indian law treats caste-
based violence as a serious criminal offense. 
Under this act, those convicted of caste-based 
atrocities face imprisonment ranging from six 
months to five years, with harsher penalties for 
repeat offenders. The law also provides victim 
protection, compensation, and special courts to 
handle such cases.
Sri Lanka desperately needs similarly strong 
legislation to combat caste oppression and 
caste-based violence effectively.
Caste-based discrimination has been deeply 
ingrained in Sri Lankan society for thousands 
of years. Tragically, many oppressed individuals 
have come to accept it as a normal part of 
life. Speaking out against caste discrimination 
exposes their identity, which can bring even 
greater hardship.
For someone from an oppressed caste, openly 
fighting caste oppression means publicly 
identifying themselves as "lower caste"—a 
revelation that can have devastating social and 
economic consequences.

Jaffna Monitor
hellojaffnamonitor@gmail.com
55
Why? Because the Vellalar caste dominates 
every major sector—education, employment, 
business, politics, and administration. If 
someone from an oppressed caste chooses 
to fight for justice, they are not only battling 
discrimination but also risking their job, their 
livelihood, and their place in society.
As a result, many oppressed individuals hide 
their caste identity. Instead of challenging 
the system, they try to blend in, pretending 
to belong to the dominant caste. Most Dalit 
people do not have the privilege or security to 
openly fight against injustice. They either accept 
caste oppression as their fate or conceal their 
identity to survive.
By speaking out against caste discrimination, 
I have personally faced significant losses. 
The only reason I can endure it is because I 
have the mental resilience to withstand the 
consequences. But not everyone has that 
privilege.
For instance, the second-in-command in our 
organization is a young Dalit man. One day, he 
confided in me: "Arun Anna, if I speak publicly 
about caste oppression, I will lose my job 
because my employer is from the Vellalar caste. 
I am willing to fight, but can you take care of 
my family if I lose my income?"
This is the cruel reality we face. The majority of 
Dalit people are still economically dependent 
on the Vellalars. Until we break this cycle of 
dependency, many will continue to remain 
silent—not out of choice, but out of fear, 
necessity, and survival.
Then why don’t you fight with the central 
government or bargain with them to enact 
laws like reservations for Tamil Dalit 
people, as in India?
I have been meeting with key Sinhala political 
leaders to educate them about the historical 
injustices we have endured. Many of them were 
completely unaware that Thesawalamai law 
functioned as a system akin to slavery. It was 
only after I pointed it out that they began to 
understand its impact.
However, our own Tamil parliamentarians will 
never allow such laws to be repealed—either 
legally or politically.
Take, for example, the 1957 Prevention of 
Social Disabilities Act. It was proposed by the 
ITAK (Federal Party)—a party that was, and 
still is, dominated by Vellalars. But this law 
was not enacted out of goodwill; it was forced 
upon them by the massive protests led by Dalit 
people in Jaffna.
If a similar large-scale protest were to erupt 
today, the Sinhala government would have no 
choice but to grant us reservations.
Governments act only when they are pressured. 
If we do not force them into action, they will 
dismiss caste discrimination as an "internal 
issue" and expect us to handle it on our own.
Did the Armed Struggle Reduce Caste 
Discrimination? Some argue that the 
Tamil armed struggle erased caste 
differences, citing the LTTE’s claim of 
being a caste-free organization. They 
often highlight the rise of Tamilselvan, a 
man from the oppressed barber caste, 
who became the LTTE’s political chief. 
What is your take on this?
When the armed struggle began, caste 
resistance movements were at their peak. It was 
a time of social upheaval, and naturally, many 
of those who joined militant groups came from 
oppressed backgrounds.

For these marginalized youth, holding a 
weapon for the first time was more than just 
participating in a war—it felt like power, 
like justice, like revenge. I believe that many 
oppressed-caste youths took up arms not only 
for Tamil Eelam but also because they carried 
generations of rage against caste discrimination. 
To them, the gun was not just a weapon; it was 
an equalizer.
However, while the gun gave them a sense 
of power, it did not erase caste. The armed 
struggle did not dismantle caste oppression; 
instead, it reinforced it in new ways. While 
oppressed-caste youth were recruited to fight 
and die, decision-making power remained 
firmly in the hands of the ruling caste—the 
Vellalars.
Those who carried rifles, who died in suicide 
attacks, and who ended up in prisons were 
overwhelmingly from oppressed castes. 
But those who crafted ideology, controlled 
leadership, and held the reins of power were the 
Vellalar elites. The influential figures behind the 
armed struggle ensured that they remained in 
control, dictating the course of the movement 
while sending the oppressed to the front lines.
They told the oppressed youth, “We need your 
sacrifice. We need you to fight.” But when 
it came to political power, governance, and 
leadership, they declared, “We are the most 
suitable to lead because we are educated and 
can speak English.”
Even Prabhakaran, a Karaiyar by caste, was not 
immune to this system. Despite leading the 
movement, he, too, was surrounded by Vellalar 
ideologues who shaped the narrative and 
structure of the struggle.
Do you really see Prabhakaran as a 
victim?
Yes, in many ways, I do.
Prabhakaran was not from the dominant 
Vellalar caste—he came from the fishing 
community (Karaiyar). Even within the 
Karaiyar caste, there were divisions: Mel-onki 
Karaiyars, who owned boats and were primarily 
businesspeople, and Kil-onki Karaiyars, who 
worked as laborers for them.
Prabhakaran belonged to the Mel-onki 
Karaiyars, and his grandfather owned business 
ships. His father was an influential government 
servant, so I am not sure if he personally 
experienced caste-based oppression.
However, Maravanpulavu Sachithanandan Iya 
once told me that in the late 1960s, when he 
organized protests against caste discrimination 
and untouchability, Prabhakaran participated in 
them.
But what I see is this—the Vellalar ideology 
used him for their own benefit. They didn’t just 
exploit Prabhakaran; they manipulated all the 
militant group leaders. They used these leaders 
to eliminate their political rivals. Prabhakaran’s 
first killing was that of Alfred Duraiappah, 
a man who could not have been defeated by 
our leaders through conventional means. This 
killing was motivated by them, and I believe 
Prabhakaran fell prey to their manipulation.
You announced that you will erect statues 
of Periyar and Ambedkar in Jaffna. What 
do you aim to achieve from this?
Both Periyar and Ambedkar are essential 
figures for us, but for two very different reasons.
Ambedkar was born into a Dalit community 
and denied dignity and equal rights. He was 
forced to stand outside the classroom while 
others studied inside. Yet, through education, 
he not only liberated himself but also wielded

knowledge as a weapon to draft the Indian 
Constitution, which enshrined reservations for 
oppressed communities.
His life teaches a powerful lesson—for every 
oppressed person, education is the ultimate 
path to freedom. That is why Dalits must see 
Ambedkar as their ideological torchbearer. He 
proved that knowledge can break chains.
But why Periyar? Because Periyar challenged 
caste oppression without relying on formal 
education. Unlike Ambedkar, he didn’t hold 
academic degrees, yet he fearlessly fought 
against Brahminical supremacy and social 
injustices. His life tells us: "Even if you don’t 
have an education, you can still fight against 
injustice. Even if you don’t have wealth, you can 
still challenge oppression."
So, what am I trying to achieve? I want to 
embed their ideology in the heart of Jaffna—a 
place where caste oppression has been 
institutionalized for centuries. It is deeply 
entrenched in our history, our temples, our 
schools, and our society.
Within this year, these statues will stand on my 
own land, in front of my office on KKS Road.
They will serve as a constant reminder to every 
oppressed person in Jaffna that we have two 
roads to liberation—one through education, the 
other through resistance.
But some Tamil nationalists say they 
will vandalize the statues. What is your 
response?
Arumuga Navalar, the torchbearer of the 
Vellalar caste ideology, has statues in several 
places across Sri Lanka. His teachings directly 
contributed to caste-based oppression, 
untouchability, and the marginalization of 
Dalits. Yet, despite being his direct victims, we 
have never attempted to vandalize his statues. 
Why? Because our belief is simple: “If you 
want to glorify him, go ahead. That is your 
ignorance, your foolishness.”
Our mindset is different—we do not impose 
our ideology on anyone. You are free to think 
forward, and you are free to think backward. 
That choice is yours. But there is one thing I 
will never allow—you treat me as a slave.
Now, think about the fascist mindset of those 
who declare they will break Periyar and 
Ambedkar’s statues. If society truly values 
democracy and freedom, people should say: "If 
others accept Periyar and Ambedkar, then let 
the statues remain." But instead, they say: "We 
will break them."
And what happens if they actually 
vandalize the statues?
If you don’t break them, that’s good. If you do 
break them, that’s even better. Let me tell you 
why. The only living person in history to have 
his own statue erected during his lifetime was 
Periyar. And what did he say?
"One day, my statue will be broken. And when 
that happens, I will go there and ask, ‘Why are 
you breaking it?’ Then at least four people will 
start searching to find out what I said." That is 
exactly what will happen here.
Every act of vandalism will only amplify Periyar 
and Ambedkar’s ideas even further. History has 
proven time and again—you cannot erase an 
ideology by mere destruction.
