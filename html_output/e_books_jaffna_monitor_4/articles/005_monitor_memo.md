n what could be seen as a strategic move—
or just another dramatic attempt to slip back 
into Parliament—ITAK General Secretary 
and Jaffna District MP M.A. Sumanthiran 
has hinted at an easy return to the big 
house. He suggested that if his longtime 
rival, ITAK Jaffna District MP S. Sritharan, 
steps down to contest for the Chief Minister 
post in the upcoming Northern Provincial 
Council election, he (Sumanthiran) would 
automatically reclaim a seat in Parliament as 
the next highest preferential vote holder from 
the party in the 2024 General Election.
However, Sritharan was quick to rain on 
that parade. Speaking to the media, he

firmly dismissed the speculation, making 
it abundantly clear that he has absolutely 
no intention of resigning. “Not today, not 
tomorrow, not in the foreseeable future,” he all 
but declared, leaving Sumanthiran’s "shortcut" 
to Parliament looking more like a dead-end.
Sumanthiran made these remarks during a 
special interview with a private television 
channel in Colombo. Addressing the 
possibility of returning to Parliament, he 
reiterated his long-standing position that 
entering through the National List is improper 
for him. "In the Jaffna electoral district, 
I secured the second-highest number of 
preferential votes within our party. Since 
we won only one seat, I was unable to enter 
Parliament. If Sritharan, who received the 
highest votes, resigns for any reason, I would 
automatically take his place as per the election 
system. There is no wrongdoing in that," he 
stated.
Sources reveal that when M.A. Sumanthiran 
lost his parliamentary seat in the last general 
election, there were behind-the-scenes 
efforts to persuade S. Sritharan to step down 
and re-enter Parliament via the National 
List—effectively handing Sumanthiran 
a smooth return to the House. Adding 
spice to the drama, a certain morning and 
evening newspaper—allegedly bankrolled by 
Sumanthiran—enthusiastically wrote about 
this theory, perhaps hoping to manifest it into 
reality.
But Sritharan wasn’t having any of it. He 
outright rejected the idea, dismissing it as a 
“funny joke.” And why wouldn’t he? Before 
the election, Sumanthiran had emphatically 
declared that he would never use the National 
List as a backdoor into Parliament. Yet, in a 
move that raised more than a few eyebrows, he 
later appointed his most die-hard loyalist—Dr. 
P. Sathiyalingam, then ITAK’s secretary—to 
the National List. Then, in what felt like a 
well-rehearsed exchange, just months after 
the appointment, Sumanthiran smoothly 
reclaimed the ITAK General Secretary post 
from him.
An ITAK insider, speaking to Jaffna Monitor, 
couldn't resist a cheeky comparison, quipping 
that the whole episode was reminiscent of 
legendary comedian Vadivelu’s classic joke: 
“You keep my akka, I’ll keep your bakery!”
P. Sathiyalingam – 
Doctor by day (part-
time), Sumanthiran 
loyalist full-time!
