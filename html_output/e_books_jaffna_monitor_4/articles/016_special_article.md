“What are we when stripped away from our 
cultural roots?… that is the question?” 
O
ne of the eternal truths of all times is that 
the tendency for change is built into all 
dimensions of the universe we live in. The Hindu 
saint Manikavasagar (khzpf;fthrfu;) in the 
9th century encapsulated this eternal truth in 
his composition Sivapuranam (or (rptGuhzk;) 
as “khw;wkhk; itafj;jpd; ntt;NtNw 
te;jwpthk;” (let us recognise the manifestations 
of a changing universe). Similar sentiments were 
summarised in Sinhala Buddhist teaching as —
fï wiaÓr f,dafla ;sfnk tlu bia;Sr foh wr 
wiaÒr ndjh mu‚˜  (the tendency for change is 
the only constant in this ever changing world). In 
this context, all dimensions of culture, including 
forms of music, have also undergone considerable 
changes over time. It continues to acquire new 
forms and these changes are largely dictated by 
the tastes and preferences of the listening public.

The nathaswaram and thavil music, as we 
have seen in parts 1, 2&3 of this series, was 
practiced by the nomadic musicians of the 
Deccan planes. It was introduced to South 
India by these moving tribes of people 
where it found widespread acceptance. In 
this context, the early music that was played 
using these instruments was no doubt in 
alignment with the folk music and dance 
traditions of these groups and was largely 
geared towards providing entertainment at 
social gatherings. However, as these groups 
found royal patronage - during the Chola 
and the subsequent Vijayanagara/Nayakkar 
periods (10th-18th centuries), and became 
accepted within the temple cultures of South 
India, the type of music and dance practiced 
by these groups also evolved and changed 
to suite the new settings. Pann Isai (gz; 
,ir), Carnatic music, Hindustani music and 
Baratha Natyam (ghuj ehl;bak;) became 
the new genre of music that was acceptable to 
their new patrons and as a consequence the 
Devdhasi/Nattuvanar (Njtjhrp el;Ltdhu;) 
communities - that were subsequently 
rename as Isai Vellalar (,ir Ntshsu;), 
also adapted their practice to become the 
main proponents of these ‘new’ art forms. 
(T M Krinshna. A Southern Music). Despite 
the discriminations they faced within a 
highly caste-conscious South Indian and Sri 
Lankan societies, the nathaswaram/thavil 
vidwans, who were also members of the 
Devdhasi/Nattuvanar community, became 
some of the greatest musicians who were 
responsible for developing carnatic music to 
new heights. T N Rajaratnam (TNR) Pillai 
from Thiruvavaduthurai (jpUthtLJiw 
uh[uj;jpdk; gps;is) was one these legends 
whose musical genius was recognised all 
over India - so much so that he was invited 
by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to 
play a nathaswaram concert to mark the 
Indian independence. The name of TNR 
became synonymous with the classical raga 
‘Thodi’ (Njhb uhfk;) and as a result he was 
Mr Panchapikesan 
Nagenthiran, the illustrious son 
of Vidwan Panchapikesan. His 
role is important in the musical 
history of the Tamil people in 
Sri Lanka as he has formed the 
link bridge between the pre-war 
vidwans from the 70s/80s and 
the new generation of artists, 
thus enabling the continuation 
of the musical traditions.

commonly (fondly) referred to as ‘Thodi 
Rajaratnam Pillai’. Many of the frontline 
vidwans of this period in South India and in 
Sri Lanka, played carnatic music exclusively 
and whenever they ventured into lighter 
forms of music towards the end of a concert, 
they would play one or two compositions of 
‘light music’ by the Tamil poet Subramaniya 
Barathyar or melodies drawn from the Tamil 
cinema. Even when they did so, the selection 
of compositions they played were based on 
classic carnatic (or Hindustani) ragas. 
The importance of cultural revival cannot 
be over stated in the rebuilding of the Sri 
Lankan Tamil community at the end of the 
prolonged civil war that lasted almost 3 
decades. A generation of nathaswaram and 
thavil vidwans have played a monumental role 
towards this end in maintaining these musical 
traditions through this prolonged period that 
was marred by war, conflict with significant 
economic hardships to all professional 
musicians. Their dedication to this cause needs 
to be recognised by the entire community. 
Four of the more popular Vidwans need a 
special mention in this context as they have 
formed the link bridge between the elders in 
their community from the 70s/80s (the pre-
war period) and the current generation of 
young post-war artists. P Nagenthiran from 
Chavakacheri, is the son of the very renowned 
Nathaswaram Vidwan Mr Panchapikesan (see 
Part 1, Jaffna Monitor 15th December 2024; 
P: 38-53), migrated to Canada during the 
troubled times and has continued to serve the 
Tamil community in Canada and many other 
European countries. Despite being domicile 
in Canada, he continued to travel to Sri Lanka 
very regularly where, along with other family 
members, he runs a training school aimed 
at nurturing budding new talents in the 
Thenmaratchi region. 
           	 
Similarly, the role played by a contemporary 
artist Mr T Ketheeswaran from Alavetti in the 
continuation of the nathaswaram traditions 
before and after the war needs emphasis. 
In addition to being a very melodious 
nathaswaram player, who was the son of a 
popular Nathaswaram Vidwan Mr Ratnavel 
from Alavetti and a long term apprentice of 
Mr N K Pathmanathan, Ketheeswaran also 
painstakingly recorded the history of this 
art form in Sri Lanka. In the monograph he 
has published in 2025, in the presence of the 
Provincial Governor HE Mr N Vedanayagam, 
he outlines the important traditions that need 
to be observed in the practice of this art form 
and the role it has played in the wider cultural 
landscape of the Tamils in Sri Lanka. The 
book entitled “jkpou; nrt;tpay; ,irAk; 
ehfRu jtpy; epfo;j;JifAk;” (The 
Excellence of Tamil Music and the Practice of 
Nathaswaram Thavil music), is no doubt an 
essential read for all people with an interest 
in Tamil Music in Sri Lanka and is perhaps 
the first book dedicated to this art form to be 
published in the country. In recognition of 
his contributions he had been awarded the 
honorary titles of rq;fPj rhfuk; (The ocean 
of music) and ehj];tu fyhepjp  (Doctorate 
in Nathaswaram) by various reputed leaned 
societies in the country. Along with his mentor 
Mr N K Pathmanathan, Mr Ketheeswaran 
performed at the 5th International Tamil 
Research Conference in 1981 and was 
decorated by the former Chief Minister Mr 
M G Ramachandran. He continues to travel 
all over the world performing at concerts that 
continue to delight the audiences and is also 
recognised as a literary giant within the Sri 
Lankan Tamil community.     
        	 	
These two musical geniuses have been 
supported by two eminent thavil vidwans who 
too came from very illustrious musical families 
in Sri Lanka. Mr T Udayashanker from 
Alavetti and the son of the all-time great thavil 
player Thakshinamurthy, and Mr S Suthaharan 
from Inuvil and the son of his illustrious father 
Mr Sinnarasa have withstood the pressures

of war and mass displacement of musicians 
and have been true servants of their places of 
birth. Their contributions are important in 
the continuation of the traditions of thavil, 
in its purest form, in Sri Lanka despite the 
interruptions caused by the long war. They 
have been the bridge between the generation 
of current thavil players and their illustrious 
forefathers in the pre-war period. 
   
There is however significant changes in the 
horizon. Age old traditions and conventions 
are being broken in order to cater to the 
needs and demands of the listening public. 
For example, supporting musical instruments 
such as the violin, electric organ, electric 
guitars, thabla, mridangam, gatam etc. are 
being introduced into concerts where the 
Nathaswaram plays a lead role. Increasingly, 
film music dominates the performances, with 
proportionately less time being allocated to 
traditional compositions such as Mallary 
(ky;yhup), Kirthanas (fPu;j;jid), Alapanas 
(Myhgid) and Kalpana swarams (fy;gdh 
];tuk;). Thavil artists seem to place greater 
emphasis on louder and (perhaps more 
‘brash’) improvisations over the more 
traditional and gentler styles that characterised 
both Thakshinamurthy and Sinnarasa in 
the 70s/80s. The popular media in some 
instances seem to prefer ‘harsher’ expressions 
such as ‘mb’, ‘mdy; gwe;jJ’ or msntl;b 
mjpu;e;jJ (beating, sparks were visible during 
the playing or Alavetti vibrated) over more 
gentler expressions such as ‘thrpg;G’ (played) 
or ‘jOtp thrpj;jhu;’ (or caressed) when 
describing what a good thavil performance 
was/is. When questioned by the writer 
about these changing trends, both Mr Udaya

and Mr Suthaharan (son of Inuvil Sinnarasa) 
acknowledged that these changes in taste 
and emphasis are indeed happening – much 
to their dislike. One of them was open in his 
comment that “if we stick to older traditional 
styles we will not be invited again by the 
organisers”. There is no doubt that not all 
these changes are welcome additions to this 
ancient art form that has hitherto defined the 
very cultural identity of the Tamil community. 
Traditionalists such as Kambavarithi Jeyaraj 
(fk;gthupjp n[auh[; from Kamban Kalagam, 
Colombo) have openly expressed reservations 
of these changing trends and what impact 
it is likely to have on the unique identity 
the art form had maintained for centuries. 
Not all vidwans are however as pessimistic 
as some of the critiques. For example, Mr 
Panchamurthi – one of the few remaining 
elders within the community, told the writer 
that it is indeed possible to accommodate 
the wishes and requests of the listening 
public without completely deviating from 
the traditional foundations of the art form. 
He even stated that, cinema music does pose 
several novel challenges and some of its 
nuances are technically harder to replicate in 
the nathaswaram. 
The new generation of nathaswaram vidwans 
such as Mr Panchamurthy Kumaran and P S 
Balamurugan are however more optimistic. 
There is no doubt that the post-war revival of 
nathaswaram and thavil music in Sri Lanka 
has been spearheaded by two extremely 
popular artists – Mr Panchamurthy Kumaran 
and Mr P S Balamurugan. These two dashing 
young men, with their outstanding talents, 
professionalism and good looks continue 
to mesmerise ‘rasikas’ across the world. 
With a strong Tamil diaspora scattered 
all around the world and an economically 
thriving India these two artists have carried 
the nathaswaram music to all parts of the

Thakshinamurthi and B: Mr S Suthaharan from 
Inuvil, son of Mr Sinnarasa. Mr Thakshinamurthy 
and Mr Sinnarasa were brothers and hence 
Udayashanker and Suthaharan are first cousins. 
Together, they have held on to the art of classical 
thavil playing and have been instrumental in passing 
their skills to the current generation of thavil artists.

world. Unlike many of their- perhaps more 
orthodox, predecessors, these two maestros 
have been more proactive in accommodating 
the changes mentioned above and have 
been instrumental in incorporating new 
innovations - including the introductions of 
new musical instruments, such as the electric 
guitar, violin, electric organ etc. into their 
performances. With this transformation, the 
nathaswaram and thavil are gradually being 
incorporated into a ‘subservient’ orchestral 
format rather than always being a free flowing 
lead solo instrument. This ‘subservient’ role 
is something which was unthinkable in the 
past (and was almost considered a sacrilege) 
due to the belief that the nathaswaram being 
a ‘Raja Vadyam’ (uh[ thj;jpak; or a Royal 
Instrument) and its role was to lead and not 
follow a written script. Whilst including these 
instruments at concerts they play in more 
relaxed environments (such as weddings or 
cultural concerts), both Balamurugan and 
Kumaran have remained true to the history of 
their art forms at more formal settings such 
as the Temples. Kumaran told the writer that 
they still place a lot of emphasis on traditional 
compositions such as the ‘Mallari’ when 
they play at temple festivals even in Western

from Kondavil. These two artists are currently the most 
popular Nathaswaram players in the world and are largely 
responsible for popularising this art form amongst the 
modern generation. Their adherence to traditional styles 
whilst accommodating the wishes of the new generation 
is most commendable. With invitations for performances 
coming from all over the world – including South India 
and the Deccans, where the intricacies of carnatic music 
is well understood, these two artists have clearly positioned 
Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan Tamil culture as a force to be 
reckoned with in the world of classical music

countries. Balamurugan told the writer, 
that “whilst accommodating the changing 
wishes and tastes of the ‘rasikas’ is essential 
for the survival of the art form, they – as the 
flag bearers of this traditional art form, are 
extremely conscious of the historic burden and 
responsibilities they carry on their shoulders 
in protecting the art form and its history”. 
Kumaran agrees with this sentiment.   
From a time period when the very survival 
of this art form was in question (due to many 
professional artists dying and/or migrating 
to undertake unrelated jobs in western 
capitals), the few remaining artists such as P 
Kumarn, P S Balamurugan, T Udaya Shanker, 
S Suthaharan and P S Senthilnathan have 
not only revived this art form, but have in 
many ways, taken it to new heights and true 
global recognition. Temples in many Indian 
states beyond Tamil Nadu – such as Kerala, 
Andra, Karnataka and Maharashtra, where the 
nuances of carnatic music is well understood, 
now regularly invite Sri Lankan nathaswaram 
and thavil vidwans to perform regularly at 
their annual temple functions. P Kumaran, 
recently performed as a back-up artist for 
a famous south Indian movie – Annaatte 
(mz;zhj;j) . These are true testaments to 
the achievements and commitment of this 
new generation of artists we should all be 
proud of and cherish.  Their services should 
be marked and every one of them should be 
respected, cherished and protected by the 
entire community. Aiding and abetting the 
distortion of their traditional art form – by 
over emphasising the role of the genre of 
music promoted by South Indian cinema for 
commercial purposes – would not serve the 
interests of a community whose survival is 
intimately linked to its age old musical and 
cultural traditions. 
The listening public no doubt has a huge 
responsibility in protecting the art form. 
Whilst there is no doubt that the current 
generation of nathaswaram and thavil 
Vidwans are as talented as and in many 
instances technically more versatile than their 
fore fathers, they are however compelled 
to respond to the demands of the listening 
public. It will be a tragedy of monumental 
proportions, if this traditional art form that 
has defined the very cultural identity of the 
Tamil people should over time evolve (or 
transform) into a form of music that has lost 
its carnatic/hindustani musical roots and 
its commitment to devotion (or Bakthi – 
gf;jp). Whilst we have to accept that every 
community and every generation has an 
inalienable right to define their own musical 
tastes and preferences, it has to be tempered 
with a sense of responsibility that takes into 
account the long term needs of a community 
– including its unique cultural position. The 
current generation of Tamils – all over the 
world, are heavily influenced by South Indian 
cinema and as a result the musical preferences 
are also reflected by the genre of popular 
music promoted within South Indian cinema. 
Whilst many compositions popularised

within Tamil cinema are based on powerful 
and emotive lyrics and are based on classical 
Carnatic and Hindustani ragas that are highly 
suited to be performed at any Nathaswaram 
concert, an equal number of compositions 
are better suited for more informal settings 
and casual parties. Whilst not wishing to 
curtail the freedom of the artists in any shape 
or form, it must be emphasised that what 
is at stake is the very cultural identity of a 
community, that is still recovering from the 
effects of a prolonged war that took the entire 
community to the very brink of destruction. 
In this context, the nathaswaram/thavil music 
must retain its position as an elite art form – 
rooted in centuries of classical and devotional 
traditions, and not transform itself into an 
entirely popular form of entertainment based 
on simple and repetitive rhythmic/lyrical 
styles.
In concluding this 4 part series of articles on 
the history of nathaswaram in Sri Lanka – with 
a particular focus on a selection of the leading 
proponents, the author is acutely aware that 
this is merely a snap shot of what is essentially 
a complex jig saw. There are bound to be 
omissions of extremely versatile artists who 
have not been as visible as others in the public 
space. This by no means undervalues their 
contributions or the quality and wisdom they 
have contributed to the wider society through 
their music. Every one of them had been 
unique and the wider community owes them 
a deep sense of gratitude. I hope this series of 
articles – in English and first of its kind in Sri 
Lanka will open the interests of a wider cross 
section of society, to this ancient art form that 
is deeply rooted in tradition and in many ways 
epitomises the cultural identity of the Tamil 
people, wherever they may live.  
The End
Jaffna-Trichy...
Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka before civil conflict 
disrupted air travel between the two regions.
The launch of this route is expected to 
significantly boost tourism and trade. Trichy, 
known for its ancient temples and historical 
landmarks, has long served as a gateway 
to Tamil Nadu’s rich cultural heritage. 
Additionally, with a large number of Sri 
Lankan refugees settled in Trichy, the new air 
route is expected to further strengthen familial 
connections between the two regions.
However, whether this route will truly benefit 
businesses remains uncertain, as Jaffna’s 
business community has long raised concerns 
about the treatment of Sri Lankan travelers at 
Tamil Nadu airports—particularly in Chennai 
and Trichy. Many complain that Indian 
immigration officers treat most Sri Lankans, 
particularly those from the North and East, 
with suspicion, often subjecting them to 
unnecessary scrutiny and discrimination.
A prominent businessman from Jaffna told 
Jaffna Monitor that he and his associates have 
stopped using Chennai and Trichy airports 
altogether due to repeated mistreatment by 
immigration officers. Instead, they now prefer 
traveling via Bengaluru or Hyderabad airports, 
where they experience less hassle and more 
professional treatment.
A well-wisher of India in Jaffna told Jaffna 
Monitor that the Indian government must 
urgently address this issue, as such treatment 
could discourage trade and travel, ultimately 
hindering the full potential of the new Trichy-
Jaffna route.
