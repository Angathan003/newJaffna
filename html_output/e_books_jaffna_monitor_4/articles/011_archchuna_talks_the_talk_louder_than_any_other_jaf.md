Archchuna Talks the Talk- Louder 
Than Any Other Jaffna MP!
D
espite his controversial nature, 
Archchuna Ramanathan has emerged 
as the top-performing parliamentarian from 
Jaffna, according to the latest Manthri.lk 
parliamentary performance rankings. Securing 
the 44th position nationally, he stands out 
as the most active representative from the 
district, surpassing his 
counterparts in legislative 
engagement.
Representing Independent 
Group 17, Archchuna’s 
rise in the rankings 
is attributed to his 
consistent participation 
in parliamentary debates, 
committee discussions, and 
legislative affairs. Whether 
or not his contributions 
have been impactful, his 
active involvement—unlike 
that of many other Tamil 
MPs—is noteworthy. 
Data indicates that his participation spans 
key policy areas such as health, rights and 
representation, and governance. Notably, 
he has attended 14 parliamentary sessions, 
making significant contributions to 
discussions on critical issues.
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, leader of the 
Tamil National People’s Front (TNPF), has 
secured the 50th position nationally, making 
him the second-highest-ranked MP from 
Jaffna. His most notable contributions are in 
the area of rights and representation, where he 
holds the top rank nationally.
Another Tamil MP demonstrating substantial 
engagement is Sivagnanam Shritharan of the 
Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), who has 
secured the 62nd position overall. With nine 
parliamentary sessions to his credit, Shritharan 
has contributed to discussions on issues 
ranging from labor and employment to justice, 
public order, governance, and 
administration.
In contrast, the three MPs 
elected from the National 
People’s Power (NPP) in 
Jaffna, despite receiving 
strong electoral support, 
have recorded minimal 
engagement in parliamentary 
affairs. Karunananthan 
Ilankumaran, who secured 
the highest number of 
votes in Jaffna in the last 
parliamentary election, is 
ranked 145th nationally. His 
participation has been limited 
to just one parliamentary session, with his 
only recorded contribution being in the area of 
natural resources and the environment.
Another NPP MP, Sri Bavanandarajah, 
has ranked even lower, standing at 159th 
nationally, with his parliamentary engagement 
confined to a single session. Meanwhile, 
Rajeevan Jeyachandramoorthy, another 
MP from Jaffna, has ranked 115th, having 
attended one session but with no recorded 
contributions to parliamentary discussions.
