his father and mother, Mangaiyarkarasi. Jaffna 
Monitor engaged in an in-depth conversation 
with him to discuss his father’s legacy, the 
significance of commemoration, and his 
perspectives on the Tamil identity and its 
future.
Why did you decide to establish the 
Amirthalingam-Mangaiyarkarasi 
Memorial now?
The house that has been converted into a 
memorial was the only property my father 
personally owned. Before entering politics, he 
had a few properties, including a shop he was 
given by his father-in-law. However, this house 
was the only property he acquired himself. 
Due to his political activities, he lost some of 
his other properties.
The foundation for this house was laid in 
1959, and it was gradually built until 1970. His 
political involvement delayed its completion. 
After losing the 1970 election in Vattukottai, 
he resumed working as a lawyer to earn money 
and was eventually able to complete the house.
Today, the house belongs to me. I often 
wondered what should become of it after my 
time. That’s when I decided to turn it into a 
memorial house for my parents.
Given the current political climate, I felt it was 
necessary to honor my father’s legacy. I also 
believe that future generations could learn 
invaluable lessons from his courageous and 
unwavering political career.
Many in today’s younger generation 
have no direct experience or memory 
of your father. However, some label 
him a traitor simply because he was 
killed by the Tigers. How do you want 
your father to be remembered?
I have no choice but to laugh and walk past 
those who call him a traitor.
But this is not just about remembering my 
father—it is about ensuring that our political 
struggle is not forgotten by the younger 
generation. We must not think that our 
struggle began only after the 1983 riots and 
ended in silence in 2009 with the annihilation 
of the LTTE.
Our movement has a long and complex 
history. Our fight for rights began in 1948. It 
took on a new dimension and escalated into 
an armed struggle after 1983. However, until 
1983, the Tamil struggle remained largely non-
violent.
Even today, our struggle remains justified. 
Successive Sri Lankan governments 
continuously deceived us and refused to grant 
our rights. It was these repeated betrayals 
that left us with no choice but to put forward 
the demand for Tamil Eelam through the 
Vaddukoddai Resolution in 1976.
The reason we pursued the Tamil Eelam 
demand and fought for it lies in our long 
history of being deceived, from 1948 to 1976. 
The anti-Sinhala Only protests of 1958, the 
Satyagraha of 1962—all of these were integral 
parts of our struggle. Each stage of our 
resistance ultimately led to the armed struggle. 
The younger generation must not forget this.
Looking back almost 50 years after the 
Vaddukoddai Resolution, do you still 
believe that the resolution arose from 
genuine grievances, or was it used as 
a political maneuver by our leaders, 
including your father?

I see it as the right decision for that time, made 
by our leaders, including Thanthai Selva and 
my father.
In 1972, when the Sirimavo Bandaranaike 
government introduced a new Republican 
Constitution, it officially abolished Section 
29 of the Soulbury Constitution, which had 
provided limited protections for minority 
rights. This new constitution declared Sri 
Lanka a unitary state, making Sinhala the only 
official language and Buddhism the foremost 
religion, further marginalizing the Tamil 
people.
At that time, S. Tharmalingam from the 
Tamil Arasu Katchi (Federal Party) was part 
of the committee responsible for drafting 
the constitution. He presented a seven-
point proposal that sought to guarantee 
language rights, equal representation, and 
regional autonomy for Tamils. However, 
this proposal was completely rejected by the 
ruling government. As a result, the limited 
safeguards granted to minorities under the 
Donoughmore (1931) and Soulbury (1947) 
Constitutions were entirely removed in the 
1972 Constitution.
It was after this betrayal that Tamil leaders 
came to the conclusion that negotiating with 
the Sinhala-majority government was futile. 
They realized that the Tamil people could no 
longer coexist within a system that repeatedly 
denied them their fundamental rights. This led 
them to demand an independent Tamil state—
Tamil Eelam.
The Vaddukoddai Resolution of 1976 was a 
historic turning point, as it was the first official 
declaration that Tamil Eelam was the only 
solution to the ethnic conflict. However, it is 
important to note that the resolution did not 
close the door on negotiations. It stated that 
if the Sri Lankan government ever decided to 
grant the Tamil people their rightful rights, 
the Tamil leadership would be willing to 
reconsider the demand for a separate state.
Therefore, the Vaddukoddai Resolution 
was not an act of political opportunism—it 
was a desperate but justified call for self-
determination, made in response to the Sri 
Lankan state's long history of deception and 
oppression.
But can you accept that the 
Vaddukoddai Resolution radicalized an 
entire generation of Tamil youth and 
led to the brutal war and the deaths of 
countless Tamil people?
No. The Students’ Council was formed in 1972, 
even before the Vaddukoddai Resolution was 
passed. Their ultimate objective was to pursue 
an armed struggle for an independent Tamil 
state. This shows that Tamil youth were already 
disillusioned and driven towards militancy, 
not because of the resolution, but due to 
systemic oppression.
One of the major triggers was the 
Standardization Policy, introduced by the 
Sirimavo Bandaranaike government in 1971. 
It deliberately lowered university admission 
marks for Sinhalese students while raising 
them for Tamil students, drastically reducing 
Tamil representation in higher education. 
This was widely seen as an attempt to suppress 
Tamil advancement, leading to frustration and 
resentment among Tamil youth.
We Tamils were pushed into a situation 
where it became impossible to achieve justice 
through peaceful means while remaining 
unarmed.

That is why Tamil youth were ultimately forced 
to take up arms. It was not the Vaddukoddai 
Resolution that radicalized them—it was 
the Sri Lankan state’s policies, violence, and 
repeated betrayals that left them no other 
choice.
I will not say that Tamil youth taking up arms 
at that time was a mistake. Just as Mahatma 
Gandhi could negotiate peacefully with the 
British, we could not negotiate peacefully 
with the Sinhala military, police, and state-
sponsored mobs that came to destroy us. 
The Sri Lankan government at that time did 
not treat Tamils as equal citizens; instead, 
it unleashed violence, state repression, and 
massacres against them.
Some people confidently say that your 
father was the most influential political 
leader in Sri Lankan Tamil society. 
However, the fact that the Tigers 
branded him a traitor and brutally 
assassinated him-and that some still 
justify it-how do you see this?
What I find truly shameful is that when the 
armed struggle began, none of the militant 
groups initially fought against the Sinhala 
government. Instead, their first target was 
the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)—
the very party that had been democratically 
chosen by the Tamil people to represent them. 
They believed that to gain recognition and 
legitimacy, they had to eliminate the existing 
Tamil leadership.
The LTTE took this to another level by 
killing my father. This was a deeply flawed 
approach, and it played a major role in our 
eventual downfall. By silencing moderate 
and experienced leaders, the armed groups 
alienated Tamil society from global diplomatic 
channels and left our people with no room for 
negotiation.
If you look at South Africa, Nelson Mandela 
was initially imprisoned for advocating 
violence. However, he later abandoned violent 
Amirthalingam

tactics and pursued non-violent diplomacy, 
which ultimately led to the fall of apartheid. 
Meanwhile, Steve Biko and the Black 
Consciousness Movement engaged in armed 
resistance but ultimately sacrificed themselves 
in the process.
Despite their ideological differences, Steve 
Biko never called Mandela wrong. In his 
interviews, he always said, "Mandela’s way is 
his way, and we support that." The LTTE, on 
the other hand, never tolerated any alternative 
perspectives. Instead of working alongside 
political leaders, they turned against them, 
which fragmented the Tamil struggle and 
weakened our cause.
The main reason the LTTE branded my father 
a traitor was because they wanted to establish 
themselves as the sole representatives of the 
Tamil people. Prabhakaran wanted to be the 
undisputed leader of the Sri Lankan Tamils.
In the 1977 democratic elections, which was 
the last democratic election before my father 
was assassinated by the LTTE, the Tamil 
people overwhelmingly gave their political 
mandate to the Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF). This meant that any negotiation 
process had to be with the leaders chosen by 
the Tamil people.
Even when foreign diplomats visited Sri 
Lanka, their first choice was to meet with the 
TULF, as it represented the democratic will of 
the Tamil people. This undermined the LTTE’s 
claim that they were the sole representatives of 
the Tamil struggle.
To eliminate this political obstacle, they 
targeted my father—and ultimately, they killed 
him. Another key reason why the LTTE saw 
my father as a threat was his support for the 
Indo-Lanka Accord.
He always believed that we should accept 
whatever political achievements we secured 
so that future generations could build upon 
them. Today, we have lost everything. The 
13th Amendment exists only on paper, and 
Tamil political power has been systematically 
dismantled. My father foresaw this, which is 
why he supported the Indo-Lanka Accord.
He also believed that only India could resolve 
our problems and that India was our only true 
ally. China had no real interest in our issue 
and always viewed it as Sri Lanka’s internal 
matter. The United States would never act 
independently—any move regarding Sri Lanka 
would always be discussed with India first.
Even during the Norwegian peace talks, Erik 
Solheim never came to Sri Lanka directly. His 
first stop was Delhi, then Chennai, and only 
after consulting Indian officials did he visit Sri 
Lanka. This proved that any solution to the 
Tamil issue had to go through India.
That is why it was necessary to accept what 
India offered and use it as a stepping stone for 
the next phase of the Tamil struggle.
After 1983, thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils 
became refugees in India, and all armed 
groups operated from Indian soil. Had the 
Tamil leadership rejected the Indo-Lanka 
Accord, India would have expelled all Tamil 
militant groups from its territory. The armed 
struggle would have been crushed before it 
even gained momentum.
By failing to understand political reality, the 
LTTE squandered every opportunity for the 
Tamil people to secure lasting political rights. 
Instead of building upon the diplomatic gains 
made by Tamil leaders like my father, they 
destroyed them.

How old were you when your father 
was assassinated?
I was 28 years old. The day before my father 
was brutally assassinated, I had left for 
London to pursue my postgraduate medical 
studies.
I still vividly remember the moment I landed 
at London Airport—exhausted from the 
long journey, completely unaware that my 
world had already changed forever. As I was 
Mr. and Mrs. Amirthalingam participating in the Satyagraha 
of 1961, a nonviolent protest led by the Federal Party (ITAK) 
against the Sri Lankan government’s discriminatory policies
A. Amirthalingam and Mrs. Mangayarkarasi Amirthalingam in Chennai, fasting in 1987 to urge the Indian government to 
intervene and stop Operation Vadamarachchi—an appeal that later led to Operation Poomalai.

Rare photos of Mr. and Mrs. Amirthalingam
traveling from the airport, the devastating 
news reached me.
The weight of that moment is something I 
cannot put into words. The last time I saw him, 
he was standing at Colombo Airport, smiling. 
The photograph taken just before I left—at 
Katunayake Airport, with my father holding 
my son—became his final picture.
My father never feared death. As Swami 
Vipulananda Adigal wrote:
"mQ;rpdu;f;Fr; rjkuzk;> mQ;rhj 
neQ;rj;J Mltu;f;F xU kuzk;"  ("For 
the fearful, there are a hundred deaths; for the 
fearless, there is only one.") This was not just a 
quote for him—it was a way of life. He carried 
himself with unshakable determination and a 
fearlessness that made him stand apart. And 
that was precisely why he was assassinated.
The LTTE could not break him, could not 
silence him, and certainly could not bend him 
to their will. They knew threats wouldn’t work, 
intimidation wouldn’t work, and bargaining 
wouldn’t work. So they eliminated him.
After his death, the TNA leaders who followed 
were exactly the kind of politicians the LTTE 
wanted—men who would obey, men who 
would carry files behind Tamilselvan like 
subordinates, men who would never dare to 
question. My father would never have been 
that kind of leader.
If he had chosen to stand with them, it would 
have been only for the sake of his people, not 
for his personal gain or his own safety. But he 
was never afraid of losing his life. He knew the 
risks, and he was always ready to die for his 
people. And in the end, he did.
Did the LTTE ever try to threaten your 
father before murdering him?
Yes, they did. In 1983, during the local 
government elections, the LTTE ordered a 
complete boycott. But my father refused to 
comply.

Determined to enforce their command, the 
LTTE went from house to house, threatening 
every candidate who planned to contest 
the election. Many, fearing for their lives, 
withdrew. Reports of candidates withdrawing 
were published daily in the Eelanadu 
newspaper.
But a few leaders refused to be intimidated. 
One of them was Communist leader 
Subramaniam. The LTTE stormed into 
Subramaniam’s home and beat him with the 
tail of a batoid fish. But he stood his ground, 
unfazed. "I will not withdraw," he declared. 
"What more can you do to me? If you’re going 
to shoot me, then go ahead and shoot."
My father possessed the same unbreakable 
spirit. At his campaign rally at Jaffna’s 
Five Junctions (Ainthu Santhi), LTTE 
cadres, including Charles Anthony and 
Sellakili, stormed the event. They seized his 
government-issued car, which was parked 
outside, and drove it wildly through the crowd, 
firing in all directions as they sped toward 
the stage. Panic spread instantly—people 
screamed and ran for cover.
At that moment, the former Deputy Mayor 
of Jaffna, M.T. Sellathurai, rushed forward 
to shield my father. But my father, calm and 
resolute, simply said: "Step aside. They won’t 
do anything to me. And if they do, so be it. Let 
them shoot."
Then, as if nothing had happened, he took a 
sip of the soda he was drinking and remained 
on stage. He did not flinch. He did not run. He 
refused to show fear.
Realizing that their intimidation tactics had 
failed, the LTTE reversed the car and fled.

They abandoned the vehicle near Kombayan 
Manal Cemetery before disappearing into the 
night.
But the Tigers knew very well that they could 
never break my father with threats or fear. And 
that is why they killed him.
Was he threatened in the days 
or months leading up to his 
assassination?
No, he wasn’t directly threatened. However, 
the LTTE systematically spread rumors in 
foreign countries where Sri Lankan Tamils 
lived, falsely claiming that he had already been 
assassinated. I believe this was a calculated 
attempt to intimidate and threaten him.
He knew something would happen to him—it 
was only a matter of time. But as the Tamil 
proverb says, "One cannot flee to foreign lands 
out of fear of the moon"  (epyTf;F mQ;rp 
guNjrk; Nghf KbahJ). In a way, he was 
ready to die from the moment he entered 
politics. He always knew his life was under 
threat, but he never let that stop him.
But What Did They Achieve by Eliminating 
My Father? Not just my father, thousands of 
people lost their lives unnecessarily in our 
struggle.
Had we accepted the Indo-Lanka Accord, 
these losses could have been prevented. When 
that agreement was introduced, the death 
toll stood at around 2,000 civilians and 700 
militants. But today, how many hundreds 
of thousands have we lost? Most of them 
died without even knowing why they were 
sacrificing their lives. And that is the greatest 
tragedy of all.
Who do you hold responsible for this 
destruction? Prabhakaran?
I would say that everyone who refused to 
accept the Indo-Lanka Accord is responsible. 
We were the ones who first started fighting 
against the Indian army that came to protect 
us. We were the ones who turned the 
peacekeeping force into a brutal force. No 
matter which country's military you provoke, 
they will always respond with force. It is wrong 
to instigate an army and then complain about 
the consequences. We took a military force 
that came to help us and turned it into our 
enemy. That was our greatest mistake.
A few writers have noted that Tamil 
leaders, including your father, wanted 
to use the LTTE as the unofficial 
military wing of their party or to settle 
scores with rival Tamil politicians who 
couldn’t be defeated otherwise—like 
in the case of Alfred Duraiappah. What 
is your response to this?
Not at all. I know that some writers make such 
claims, but they have no factual basis.
Most of the leaders of the armed militant 
groups were originally members of the TULF 
Youth Wing. Prabhakaran was not part of it, 
but Uma Maheswaran was a representative of 
the Colombo youth wing of TULF. Varadaraja 
Perumal and Padmanabha were also members 
of the Youth Wing.
Even now, it has become common practice 
to blame Tamil political leaders, including 
my father, for inciting youth to take up arms. 
But the truth is, our youth were not merely 
brainwashed—they had their own grievances, 
their own reasons for choosing the path of

armed struggle. They did not take up arms 
simply because someone manipulated them; 
they believed their struggle was justifiable and 
accepted it as necessary.
The Tamil nationalism we speak of today 
was not something suddenly created by 
Prabhakaran. It was a concept nurtured from 
1948 onwards, planted in the hearts of the 
Tamil people through the sacrifices of leaders, 
activists, and supporters of Tamil Arasu 
Katchi and the Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF). It was not Prabhakaran alone who 
shaped this ideology. Unfortunately, over time, 
that sense of Tamil nationalism has started to 
fade.
Saying that my father was behind Duraiappah’s 
murder is nothing short of absolute nonsense. 
At that time, the Tamil United Liberation 
Front (TULF) was focused on removing him 
through democratic means. The party worked 
to pass a no-confidence motion against him to 
oust him from his position—not to assassinate 
him.
Not only in the case of Alfred Duraiappah, 
but some have also accused my father of being 
responsible for internal killings within militant 
groups, such as the murders of Comrade 
Sundaram, Iraikumarn, and Umaikumarn. 
However, these claims are baseless.
Blaming my father for internal killings within 
militant groups is absurd. He had no role in 
such incidents.
But some claim that Tamil United 
Liberation Front (TULF) leaders, 
particularly your mother, publicly 
stated that Alfred Duraiappah would 
never die a natural death. Some 
also believe that such provocative 
speeches ultimately influenced 
Prabhakaran, who was deeply 
impacted by this rhetoric. What is your 
response to that?
The only person who ever made such a 
statement (that Duraiappah would never die a 
natural death) was Kasi Anandan.
There are many fabricated quotes falsely 
attributed to my mother, including claims 
that she said, "I will skin the Sinhalese and 
make sandals" or "I will peel off Sinhalese 
skin." These are outright falsehoods 
deliberately spread by Sinhala extremists in 
southern Sri Lanka to incite hostility against 
the TULF. Some Sinhala newspapers even 
published these false reports, further fueling 
misinformation.

My mother never made such remarks on 
stage in the presence of leaders like Thanthai 
Selva or my father. She was known for 
her emotionally charged speeches, often 
incorporating songs, and she spoke with deep 
passion, especially when addressing crowds. 
It is possible that she, like many others at the 
time, called Duraiappah a traitor. However, she 
would never have declared that he would not 
die a natural death.
It is true that Duraiappah was labeled a traitor, 
but that was because, during that period, 
anyone who collaborated with the government 
was seen as a betrayer of the Tamil cause.
Looking back, don’t you think this 
"traitor" rhetoric inflicted deep harm 
on our people? Ironically, Alfred 
Duraiappah, who was branded a 
traitor, was killed by Prabhakaran, 
and the very people who labeled him 
a traitor were also eventually killed by 
Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran himself met 
his end in the Nandikadal Lagoon. After 
witnessing all this destruction, how do 
you now view this rhetoric? How do you 
see the "traitor-martyr" ideology today?
"kopj;jYk; ePl;lYk; Ntz;lh cyfk;
gopj;jJ xopj;J tpbd;."
("What's the worth of a shaven head or tresses 
long, If you shun what all the world condemns 
as wrong?")
This is a verse from the Thirukkural (Kural 
280), emphasizing that rituals or external 
symbols are meaningless if one does not act 
according to righteousness. This aptly suits 
Duraiappah.
We were meant to live in harmony with our 
people. But at that time, when 99% of the 
Tamil population supported the struggle for 
our rights, Duraiappah stood as an agent of 
the government.
I do not personally condemn Duraiappah. 
He did remarkable work for the Jaffna 
Municipality, improving infrastructure and 
services. However, when figures like Anura 
Bandaranaike and Sirimavo Bandaranaike 
visited Jaffna, he acted as a government agent, 
aligning himself with the state’s interests rather 
than the people’s aspirations.
I do not believe that branding those who 
aligned with the government as traitors was 
wrong, because this is a common occurrence 
in any country where people are engaged in a 
struggle against oppression.
Similarly, in countries where armed 
movements rise against the state, those 
perceived as government representatives are 
often targeted—this is not unique to Sri Lanka. 
Even during India’s freedom struggle, similar 
events unfolded.
You say that Alfred Duraiappah acted 
against the will of 99% of the Tamil 
people. But wasn’t he continuously 
elected as the Mayor of Jaffna through 
democratic elections?
He did not win any elections after 1970.
But he was still the Mayor of Jaffna at 
the time of his death, wasn’t he?
Yes. But the Tamil United Liberation Front 
(TULF) was actively working to bring a no-
confidence motion against him due to his anti-
Tamil actions.

So, do you support Alfred Duraiappah's 
murder?
No, no. I will never justify the killing of any 
individual. I will never say that it was right.
Did you ever meet Prabhakaran? 
We heard that he was once a great 
admirer of your father and that he 
liked him.
Yes, I met him many times. After the Pondy 
Bazaar shooting incident in 1982, Prabhakaran 
was required to live in Madurai as a bail 
condition. During that time, he stayed at 
Pazha. Nedumaran's house. At that time, I was 
a medical student at Madurai Medical College, 
so our paths crossed.
During the 2002 peace period, someone 
told me that Prabhakaran had said, "I did 
not order Amirthalingam’s assassination; it 
was Mathaya’s doing." But I never believed 
that. The LTTE was an extremely disciplined 
and tightly controlled organization-nothing 
happened without Prabhakaran’s knowledge or 
approval.
Setting aside personal feelings, how 
do you view Prabhakaran?
He should have acted based on what was best 
for the Tamil people, not merely what was best 
for the LTTE. That was his greatest mistake.
However, I still respect him as a leader 
who built one of the most powerful armed 
movements. 
There is a time to fight and a time to negotiate-
no community can remain in a state of 
constant war. What we lost was not small.
Prabhakaran should have accepted the Indo-
Lanka Accord. He could have even become the 
Chief Minister under that agreement. Had he 
done so, much of the destruction we suffered 
could have been avoided. Even the current 
tragic state of the Tamil people could have 
been prevented.
In that aspect, what he and the LTTE did to 
the Tamil people was a grave injustice.
Answer in one sentence-Did 
Prabhakaran bring good or harm to the 
Eelam Tamil people?
In the end, it was harm-no matter how hard 
they fought or how many thousands of young 
lives were sacrificed, we gained nothing.
We achieved absolutely nothing. The only so-
called political gain we have today is the 13th 
Amendment, which exists merely on paper.
Had we worked alongside the Indian 
government, today we would either be an

independent nation or at least governing 
a unified Northern and Eastern Provincial 
Council.
Our land and language would have been 
protected-but now, we have lost everything.
You and your mother personally met 
the security officers who killed the 
men responsible for assassinating 
your father?
In 2011, Saroj Pathirana from BBC Sinhala 
Service took us to meet them. We met 
Nishanka, one of my father’s security officers-a 
loyal guard who tried to save my father.
In the history of Sri Lanka, this was the only 
instance where the assassins of a political 
leader were immediately killed on the spot. 
For that, we owe them our gratitude.
When my father was killed, Sirimavo 
Bandaranaike herself attended the funeral 
and told my mother: "I'm really pleased, Mrs. 
Amirthalingam, that our people didn’t do it."
How do you see the irony that a 
beloved Tamil leader was assassinated 
by the LTTE, which claimed to 
represent Tamils, but the security 
officers-who risked their lives to save 
him-were from an ethnicity that was at 
war with the Tamils?
This is one of the greatest ironies of our 
history. Individually, the Sinhalese people 
are good-hearted, cultured, and respectable. 
The political conflict may have divided 
our communities, but on a human level,

compassion and loyalty transcended ethnic 
lines.
Until the final phase of the war, it was not 
the Sinhalese who were responsible for 
assassinating Tamil leaders—it was the Tamil 
militant groups themselves.
For example, V. Dharmalingam, who 
dedicated his life to the Tamil cause, was 
tortured and brutally murdered by the TELO, 
who then dumped his body in the fields like it 
was worthless.
And in my father’s case, the ones who stood 
between him and death, who fought to protect 
him, who risked their own lives to save him, 
were his Sinhalese security officers. They saw 
a man they had sworn to protect, and they 
fought for him. 
How do you view the current state of 
the Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK)? Their 
representation in Jaffna has now been 
reduced to just one seat.
I never held an important position in the 
party-I was just an ordinary member. But after 
2018, the ITAK I see today is unrecognizable.
I have no idea what its leaders are doing 
or why they are doing it. There is no clear 
direction, no vision. This situation benefits 
neither the party nor the Tamil people.
The people’s disappointment is evident, which 
is why they elected three NPP MPs-a Sinhala-
based party-in Jaffna. This shows that people 
have started believing that ITAK is useless and 
incapable of doing anything meaningful.
Whom do you blame for this?
I don’t know if a single person can be blamed. 
I would say it is the failure of collective 
leadership. They have lost the trust of the 
people and lack the unity needed to act 
effectively. Instead of working together, they 
are engaging in petty cliques and legal battles, 
which bring no benefit to our people.
