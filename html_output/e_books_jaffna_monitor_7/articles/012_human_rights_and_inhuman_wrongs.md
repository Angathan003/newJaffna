1. The graph below are 
statistics from the human 
rights commission of 
complaints received since 
2010 in the Northern 
Province.
The HRC though does not 
have an age analysis on the 
complaints. I.e. for recording, 
hearing and conclusion of' 
complaints. Types include: 
1. Personal Liberty: 2. Other 
Civil & Political Rights: 3. 
Employment 4. Education 
5. State Welfare Services 6. 
Infrastructure Utilities 7. 
Complaints Relating to Voter 
Registration 8. Complaints 
about Inactions of Govt. 
Entities 9. Child Rights 10. 
Rights of Differently-abled 
Human Rights and inhuman wrongs
11. Language rights 12. Migrant Workers Rights 13. LGBT 
Rights (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender) 14. Health 
rights 15. Land & Property Rights 16. IDP Returning 
Refugees 17. Environmental Rights 18. Administrative 
Matters 19. Rights of Women.
There fundamentally must be a sense of urgency when 
addressing human rights abuses.  Lack of oversight tracking 
defeats the essence of the enterprise.

3. Violation of citizens rights- Human 
Rights Report: Methsevena State House of 
Detention, Gangodawila, and Human Rights 
Report: Methsevena State House of Detention, 
Gangodawila, March and July 2004.
Detention of Children-Presently 16 
children younger than five years of age 27 are 
living in detention at Methsevena. Most of 
the children have no other guardian willing 
to care for them. Although it is preferable 
to keep young children with a parent, their 
rights are gravely violated when they are 
forced into detention. The children are 
negatively impacted because they lack access 
to a regular paediatrician, vital vaccinations, 
sanitary conditions and age-appropriate 
social interaction.
Detention of Women with Mental 
Health Problems-Women with mental 
health problems live in a separate ward in 
the old building and receive monthly clinics 
conducted by Angoda Mental Hospital for 
the 73 women with psychological problems. 
Most of these women have been detained for 
non-punishable behaviours, listed as “mental 
illness,” “deaf,” “cripple” and “epilepsy.” 
The women with mental health problems, 
particularly the women with serious mental 
2. Violation of the Constitution- The 
most well-known but sad abuse a of a right 
was the illegal removal and subsequent 
assumption for one day in office of the 
47th Chief Justice no less, Dr. Shirani 
Bandaranayke.
The Govt explained the reinstatement in 
this manner: Earlier in the day, President 
Maithripala Sirisena had issued two letters. 
One letter was dispatched to de facto Chief 
Justice Mohan Pieris. The other was issued to 
de jure Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayke. 
In the letter to Pieris, President Sirisena 
said that his purported appointment had 
no legal validity and was therefore void. 
The letter said, there was no vacancy 
created for the position of Chief Justice 
because Shirani Bandaranayke was not 
removed in accordance with the terms of the 
constitutional provisions by an address of 
Parliament. Pieris was therefore asked to take 
note that he was not the lawful Chief Justice 
of Sri Lanka.
The second letter to Bandaranayke was a 
copy of the first. It also included a covering 
letter, signed by President Sirisena, informing 
the ousted Chief Justice that Pieris had been 
informed that his appointment was void. The 
letter asked her to kindly resume duties as 
lawful Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Copies of 
the letters were also issued to the Supreme 
Court Registrar.
Govt. urged to reveal observations 
of indep. Panel (Daily Mirror 
13/1/2013)’ It is learnt that the 
committee appointed to look into the 
charges against ousted Chief Justice 
Dr. Shirani Bandaranayke comprised 
Professor Mark Cooray, former Central 
Bank Deputy Governor Ranee Jayamaha, 
former Parliament Secretary General 
Dhammika Kithulegoda and Consortium 
of Humanitarian Agencies Chairman 
Jeevan Thiagarajah’. It is reliably learnt 
that certain panellists in their individual 
recommendations submitted to presidential 
secretary Lalith Weeratunge had expressed 
reservations of varying degrees on the 
charges. My view was carried in the Daily Ft 
on 14 th January 2015.

illness, face specific problems in detention. 
First, the psychiatric ward is plagued by the 
worst living conditions in the facility. Most 
women wear filthy, torn clothing. Small 
rooms house up to twenty women, and many 
are lacking bedding and lighting. Second, 
the women lack necessary mental health 
and medical services. A monthly clinic is 
grossly inadequate to address the specific 
issues faced by women with mental illness. 
Third, the detainees with mental illness have 
nothing to do. Most wander around the ward 
or sleep. Fourth, the detainees with mental 
health problems lack adequate supervision 
because the institution does not provide a 
regular supervisor in the psychiatric ward. 
Instead, other detainees, unpaid for their 
work, serve as caretakers for the women with 
mental illness.
As a result of the surprise visits to 
Methsevena State House of Detention, 
Gangodawila, the Commission urges the 
following: 1. immediately address the 
problems associated with detention without 
the proper court mandate, including no-date 
detainees, detainees held after their sentence, 
the refusal to release detainees without a 
guardian and the detention of women who 
have not committed punishable offences. 
a. Resolve the discrepancy regarding the 
definition of vagrant in the Vagrant’s 
Ordinance and the Houses of Detention 
Ordinance.
Note: The report catalogues horrendous 
abuse of rights of vulnerable citizens. What 
is required is penalties on those responsible, 
payment of damages and restorative justice 
for the victims. In this instance, it did not 
occur even 10 years after the report!  
4. Accountability for lapses leading 
to death, injury and destruction to 
property following Easter Sunday 
Blasts in April 2019.
 I write as a citizen.  Triggered by the story 
of Kieran Alexander Shafritz de Zoysa, an 
eleven (11) year old boy who died in one of 
the blasts and is half SL with a SL mother. 
His profile is attached. 18th June 2019
a.	The State is obliged to protect the life and 
limb of its citizens whilst they also have 
a reasonable expectation of protection of 
their belongings.  The 21st April blast we 
know resulted   in death and destruction.  
Given information in the public domain 
with malice to none has the Actg IGP and 
/or National Police Commission sought 
to inquire into responsibility within the 
Police, lapses if any and consequences for 
any lapses? If not why not? 
b.	Several days after the blasts organized 
violence by mobs was seen directed at 
Muslim owned properties. Has the Actg. 
IGP and /or National Police Commission 
sought to inquire into responsibility 
within the Police, lapses if any and 
consequences for any lapses? If not why 
not?
c.	Following from (a) and (b) were any 
employee of the Police Department 
obstructed from performing his/her duties 
leading to the outcomes raised above and 
if yes, what protection can or should be 
provided to prevent recurrence? If not why 
not?
Note: Submission drew no response from 
the Chairman of HRC! Subsequently 
we had a plethora of reports, cases and 
determinations.

7. 	Continuous violation of rights
	
Letter of Governor to S/PSC
HRC regional coordinator submitted 35 
observations on 2021.05.06 and the response 
from NPC is pending. The Governor 
withdraws forthwith the Charge sheet since 
tenets of natural has been absent, noticed by 
the PSC, and requires the Chief Secretary to 
do so parallelly with the relevant line agency 
with notice to …………within 7 days.
The Governor seeks the intervention of HRC 
to lay suit and recover damages as deemed 
necessary on behalf of………. The Governor 
is of the view several senior officials 
have colluded and acted in a monstrous 
5. Innocent man suffered over 
Kadirgamar assassination
I write with reference to a web-based article 
seen attached titled, “Innocent man suffered 
over Kadirgamar assassination “. The web 
link is   http://newshub.lk/en/2019/07/02/

Is it within the purview of the HRC to:
a.	Go over the case record and potentially 
seek compensation for the surviving 
family members?
b.	Define a method whereby prisoners 
who are either in remand or have 
been sentenced wrongfully are legally 
protected? 
Note: Eerie silence was the response of the 
Chairman HRC!
6. Revisiting to remedy improprieties 
in disciplinary inquiries
Matters under consideration of the first and 
second preliminary inquiries are broadly 
different. First report was not commissioned 
or for the benefit of the (redacted). Hence 
their satisfaction or dissatisfaction is 
immaterial to conclude and act on the 
first preliminary inquiry. Taking into 
consideration (2-4) above, the process has 
compromised the objectivity and legality of 
both preliminary inquiries. 
The first inquiry was out of time nor has 
time been sought for extension nor a bar 
from Court to proceed. Commencement 
of a second preliminary inquiry against 
the petitioner connecting it with the first 
preliminary of the above mentioned whilst 
the first remains without conclusion is 
arbitrary and illegal on the face of law. The 
Governor cannot prima facie knowingly 
accede nor be party to breaking the law. 
The Governor thus squashes the boards, 
proceedings and findings of both preliminary 
inquiry processes conducted under the aegis 
of MoH, NP.  
Note: The Secretary of the line ministry did 
not act on the letter sent. The AG declined to 
appear for the Governor since the findings 
were different to instructions they had 
received previously. The question thus is the 
AG and the Governor legally bound to do 
what is right or not?! The Governor chose to 
do so.

unaccountable manner in concert, at the 
behest of one original complainant for 
his personal interest. The report of the 
HRC makes for horrendous reading on 
account of the outrageous findings of 
facts therein.  The PSC should consider 
imposing penalties on serving public 
servants giving consideration to the 
report of the HRC as well as docking the 
pension in part as damages, if possible, 
of those retired who acted in concert on 
this matter.
The aggrieved party (redacted) must 
recover her promotion rights.  
The Chief Secretary preceding the 
current office holder has acted in 
an ugly, vindictive manner so has 
potentially some members of the 
incumbent N/PPSC. It must not be 
repeated. It has brought total dishonor 
on the Northern Provincial Public 
Service which had in 1987 a scintillating 
persona and should rise again to 
become the gold standard in Provincial 
Public Service.
This disgraceful episode the incumbent 
Governor will stamp out forthwith, 
whilst believing senior officials who 
could have shown courage to do the 
right thing had not done so to date. 
The direction of the Governor is a 
consequence of their inaction and 
indecisiveness. Furthermore, grotesque 
elements of misplaced male chauvinism 
is found in the record on this matter.

Submission of the victim to Chairman /
HRC 
The Human Rights Commission in inquiry 
reference has in Paragraphs 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,
13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,23,24,27,28,29,30
,31,32,33 and 34 made reference to the sum 
total of victimization and harassment based on 
personal prejudice tantamount to violation of 
my fundamental rights.
The Hon. Governor independently has drawn 
the conclusion that tenets of natural justice 
were violated. Shown previously in Annex 
I. Hence, he had forthwith withdrawn the 
fabricated charge sheet prepared by the Chief 
Secretary.
The HRC has in the conclusions of the inquiry 
report found victimization based on personal 
grounds by senior officials against me.  The 
Hon. Governor has withdrawn the Charge 
sheet. Administrative Tribunal has accepted 
the merits and content of the letter and 
directions of the Hon. Governor. The PSC has 
acted in violation of my fundamental rights by 
reissuing the same charge sheet seen in Annex 
II. I was thus victimized and tormented once 
more for no reason. The PSC has acted on a 
false set of documents produced by the NPC 
where two senior officials have been named 
as the principle offending parties, where their 
inconsistencies and lies have been named and 
exposed by the HRC. The Hon Governor has 
requested HRC and the PSC to act against the 
said officials. In fact, the PSC should act against 
the said officials without victimizing me the 
aggrieved party.
Note:  The HRC concluded its inquiry in May 
2021.  To date no order has been made. The 
details are replete with horrendous misconduct, 
victimization, persecution and the continuous 
violation of the rights of the victim. The HRC is 
cognizant of the details since 2021.

9. Availing of services of the HRC in 
the Northern Province  
The Governor wishes to propose a few 
collaborative Suo moto inquiries in the 
province if the Commission were to concur. 
E.g. Involuntary warding of those mentally 
ill, paucity of transport services by the SLTB 
in particular for school children; With no 
malice to employees its best staff rotate out 
of stations every 5 years at the outer limit as 
is the public service norm to ensure optimal, 
swift delivery of services and relief where 
required for complainants; The Governor 
desires allocating plots of land to the poor 
soon.  Criteria to follow.  Services of HRC to 
adjudicate on the fairness or exclusion of any, 
if such complaints were to be received would 
assist immeasurably. Consideration is kindly 
sought in principle for the above.
Note: The letter addressed to the Chairman 
HRC drew no response!
8. Example of seeking Counsel from 
the AG to remedy violations (Letter 
from Governor to State Counsel) 
Has the NP treated the complainant fairly 
or unfairly? If not how so? As I understand 
group of laborers struck work. Has the reason 
been looked into, when, by whom, what was 
the outcome, when?  Did the right person 
look into it?  Why was Mrs. S. ……. brought 
into the inquiry? Was that a correct decision?  
PPSC directed she be temporarily attached 
to another institution/post?  Was she told or 
not? If not why not?  Did she not find only 
through a RTI application? On what basis 
did CLG appeal to PPSC?  Should S/LG if 
at all have done so or should Deputy Chief 
Secretary Admin have done so?  If errors 
have been made to the detriment of the 
complainant should the salary due during 
the VOP be recovered from the DCS Admin 
& CLG?   Sick leave taken was incorrect. 
Salary cannot be given for that period. Did 
the appeal mechanism work fairly, on time 
in this instance? PPSC had taken 3 decisions 
on one individual.  Should Governor call for 
explanation?  Are PPSC members personally 
liable or immune from prosecution? I am 
inclined to order payment of salary during 
VOP if I can full justify it was wrong. Can 
you assist with the above? 
The scope of the advice tendered in the 
directive principles to guide government 
policy is wide ranging in nature.  The 
execution of the guide through policy is the 
delivery of the promises to citizens by the 
state through the Constitution.
In very many instances the execution and 
delivery of justice falls far short of the 
required level. Officers of the Government 
need to be protected too if they are to act 
without fear of repercussions.   Organs of 
government seem insufficiently sensitive, 
become accessories to violations by default 
due to inaction, seem enmeshed in actions 
which preserve the status quo and lastly lets 
down the state in its obligation to protect 
citizens.
