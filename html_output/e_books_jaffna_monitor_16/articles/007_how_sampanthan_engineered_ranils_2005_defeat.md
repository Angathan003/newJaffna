hen the LTTE leadership wanted 
to teach Ranil Wickremesinghe 
a lesson—due to his involvement in the 
LTTE's infamous eastern split, where LTTE's 
eastern commander Karuna Amman and his 
6,000 cadres left the LTTE—Prabhakaran 
decided to make the people of the North 
and East boycott the 2005 presidential 
election. Prabhakaran knew that these 
people would overwhelmingly vote for 
Ranil. Sampanthan, without any shame, 
carried out Prabhakaran's directive to the 
masses and gave it a political spin.
Sampanthan declared that there hadn't 
been any peace developments. "Nothing 
worthwhile would be achieved by 
supporting either of the two leading 
candidates, Mahinda Rajapaksa and Ranil 
Wickremesinghe," he stated. Sampanthan 
shamelessly asserted that the Tamil-speaking 
people were not interested in the election.
Recently, TNA member of parliament 
Sumanthiran commented on the 2005 polls 
boycott in the presence of President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe in Jaffna. Sumanthiran 
told the gathering, which again stirred 
controversy among the LTTE's diaspora 
and its supporters: "It is possible that the 
challenges in the North may have impeded 
your journey in 2005, a fact that I believe is 
now regretfully acknowledged by the people 
of the region."
However, he failed to mention that the 
TNA and its leadership, including his once-
regarded guru Sampanthan, compelled the 
people to boycott the elections on orders 
from the LTTE.
