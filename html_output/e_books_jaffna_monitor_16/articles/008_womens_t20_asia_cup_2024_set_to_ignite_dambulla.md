The Women's T20 Asia Cup 2024 is slated 
to commence on July 19 at the Rangiri 
Dambulla International Cricket Stadium 
(RDICS) in Dambulla. While women's 
cricket traditionally doesn't draw as many 
eyes as the men's, Sri Lankan fans are 
buzzing with excitement this time. Perhaps 
the never-ending saga of underwhelming 
performances by the men's team is driving 
this newfound enthusiasm.
The tournament will feature teams from Sri 
Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, UAE, 
Nepal, Malaysia, and Thailand. Divided into 
two groups, the teams will compete fiercely 
over 15 matches, culminating in the semi-
finals and finals.
Powerhouses India and Pakistan will clash 
alongside UAE and Nepal in Group A. 
Meanwhile, Group B will witness battles 
between Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, 
and Thailand. The opening day will see UAE 
facing Nepal at 2 p.m., followed by a highly 
anticipated match between arch-rivals India 
and Pakistan at 7 p.m.
Ravin Wickramaratne, Vice President of 
Sri Lanka Cricket, has been appointed as 
the Tournament Director by the Executive 
Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket and the 
Asian Cricket Council. In a statement, 
Wickramaratne expressed confidence in 
hosting a successful tournament, highlighting 
its potential to elevate women's cricket 
globally.
"Sri Lanka Cricket, with the support of the 
Asian Cricket Council, is planning to conduct 
a highly successful tournament, as a successful 
outcome of this tournament will help advance 
women's cricket on the world stage," said 
Wickramaratne.
Adding a humorous twist to the fan 
enthusiasm, a few Sri Lankans on Facebook 
have even suggested forming a mixed 
team after the World Cup, given the stellar 
performance of Chamari Athapaththu, the 
current captain of the women's Twenty20 
International team of Sri Lanka. One fan 
quipped, "Chamari Athapaththu is playing 
better than our so-called men cricket stars. It's 
time we let her lead a mixed team!" Another 
fan added, "At this rate, we might finally have a 
winning team!"
All Women's T20 Asia Cup 2024 matches will 
be broadcast live on international platforms. 
Moreover, in a bid to encourage public 
support, the stadium gates will be open for 
free, inviting cricket fans to witness top-class 
cricketing action firsthand.
