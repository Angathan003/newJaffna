T
he first national conference of the Tamil 
People's National Alliance (TPNA)-a 
political party whose leaders seem as 
directionless as a rudderless ship-has been 
announced to take place in Jaffna. This 
conference will be held on Sunday, the 21st 
of this month, at 3 PM, at the Thanthai Selva 
Auditorium.
The conference will be presided over by 
the self-aggrandizing Secretary General 
of the TPNA and Member of Parliament, 
C.V. Wigneswaran. The chief guest for the 
event will be TNA's Member of Parliament, 
Sivagnanam Shritharan, who is currently 
embroiled in a leadership struggle within 
ITAK with Sumanthiran. Rumor has it that 
Shritharan might deliver an address on "The 
Art of Faction Politics: How to Divide and 
Conquer."
The keynote address will be delivered by Dr. 
K. T. Ganeshalingam, Head of the Department 
of Political Science at the University of Jaffna, 
who is likely to offer his profound insights 
on political science, possibly titled "How to 
Appear Knowledgeable While Being Clueless."
The TPNA promises that the event will 
feature cultural performances, though there's 
no announcement yet on whether C.V. 
Wigneswaran will dance to the political tunes 
from diaspora tiger proxies. Special speeches 
and the announcement of conference 
resolutions-if they can decide on any-will also 
be part of the event.
