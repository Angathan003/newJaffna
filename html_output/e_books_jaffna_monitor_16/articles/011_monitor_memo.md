Monitor Memo
U
ma Kumaran, a British national of Sri 
Lankan Tamil descent, has been elected 
as the first Member of Parliament (MP) for 
Stratford and Bow in the United Kingdom. 
Representing the Labour Party, Kumaran 
secured 19,145 votes in the recent UK general 
election.
Kumaran was born in East London to Tamil 
parents who fled Sri Lanka's civil war. Her 
professional background spans work in the 
National Health Service (NHS), politics, and 
global climate advocacy. Reflecting on her 
family's history, she said, "The war changed 
the course of my parents' lives - so many 
millions of our lives. We are a displaced 
people in every corner of our planet."
Kumaran recognizes the challenges British 
Tamils face in political engagement but sees 
positive trends. "Representation matters. We 
need more women, people from working-class 
backgrounds, ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ+ 
persons overall," she said.
Kumaran has criticized the Conservative 
government's policies on Tamil asylum 
seekers facing deportation from the UK 
and territories such as Diego Garcia. She 
described the policy of sending asylum 
seekers to Rwanda as "dehumanizing" and 
assured that a Labour government would 
abolish such practices. "I'll always push to 
ensure that Tamils in the UK who have a 
genuine asylum claim are not being sent back 
to danger," she pledged.
Domestically, Kumaran emphasized the 
importance of the National Health Service 
(NHS), noting the significant number of 
British Tamils working there. She supports 
Labour's plans to address NHS waiting times, 
improve mental health services, and tackle 
other critical issues. "A Labour Government 
created the NHS, and it's a Labour 
Government that will fix it," she said.
Encouraging political participation, Kumaran 
urged young British Tamils to get involved in 
politics. "Do it! It's your right, and it's your 
voice," she said.
In an unexpected turn of events, Kumaran 
faced a personal challenge shortly after her 
election. On her first day in the Commons, 
her 39-year-old husband, who is otherwise 
healthy, suffered a stroke. Kumaran shared 
the news, describing the last 24 hours as "the 
hardest of our lives," and expressed gratitude 
to the NHS staff at the stroke unit. She asked 
her constituents for patience as she dealt with 
this personal crisis, assuring them she would 
soon be back in Parliament. "Thank you to the 
Speaker, House staff, police, Whips team, and 
colleagues for their support," she added.
