In a significant drug bust, the Chavakachcheri 
police seized a staggering 87 kilograms—
not grams—of Kerala ganja from a house 
in Kodikamam. Two individuals have been 
arrested and placed in remand custody. The 
influx of narcotics into Sri Lanka, especially 
into Tamil-speaking areas, has been alarmingly 
high in recent times, raising serious concerns 
about national security, public safety, and the 
future of Tamil youths.
Acting on information from the military 
intelligence division, the police conducted a 
search operation at the Sangupiddy Bridge. 
During the search, a government employee 
with the Sri Lanka Transport Board was 
arrested with 500 grams of ganja, which was 
cleverly concealed inside a car. The arrested 
individual is a 47-year-old resident of 
Vavuniya.

During the interrogation, the arrested 
individual revealed that the ganja was given 
to him by a fellow government employee 
attached to the same department who resides 
in Kodikamam. Following this information, 
the police surrounded the house of the said 
individual in Kodikamam. A staggering 
quantity of 87 kilograms of Kerala ganja was 
seized during the raid. The main suspect had 
fled the scene, but his mother, who was at the 
house and also an accomplice, was arrested.
This massive amount of narcotics raises 
several critical questions. How did such a 
large quantity of ganja make its way into 
Kodikamam? The prevailing theory is that 
it came by sea, highlighting potential lapses 
in maritime security. What are the maritime 
security forces doing to prevent such 
substantial drug shipments from entering the 
country?
Adding to the complexity of the issue, many 
so-called Tamil nationalist politicians are 
appearing in court to defend these drug 
mafias. These lawyers shamelessly speak about 
Tamil nationalism and Tamil upliftment while 
representing drug dealers, undermining the 
very principles they claim to uphold. Despite 
calls from several civil societies for these 
lawyers to cease representing drug offenders, 
their pleas have fallen on deaf ears.
Moreover, the arrested individual and the one 
who escaped are government employees at 
the Sri Lanka Transport Board. Their direct 
involvement in this drug operation raises 
serious eyebrows and questions about the 
integrity of public servants and the potential 
complicity within government ranks.
This incident underscores the urgent need 
for stringent measures to combat the growing 
drug menace and ensure that those involved, 
regardless of their political affiliations or 
government positions, are brought to justice.

S
ri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has 
announced the appointment of 
cricket legend Sanath Jayasuriya as the 
interim head coach of the men's national 
team. Jayasuriya, renowned for his 
explosive batting style and credited with 
revolutionizing the 50-over format in 
the 1990s, will take charge immediately 
and lead the team until the conclusion of 
their upcoming tour of England. There 
is uncertainty about whether he will 
continue in this role after the England 
tour, with future decisions likely to 
depend on the team's performance.
Jayasuriya steps into the role following 
the resignation of Chris Silverwood, 
who departed after Sri Lanka's 
underwhelming performance in the ICC 
Men's T20 World Cup 2024. Despite 
notable successes during his tenure, 
including a T20 Asia Cup victory in 2022 
and a runner-up finish in the 50-over 
Asia Cup in 2023, Silverwood's exit was 
prompted by the team's disappointing 
campaign in the T20 World Cup, where 
they managed only one win in four 
games, finishing third in Group D.
A Proven Track Record
Jayasuriya's cricketing credentials are impeccable. 
He has played 586 matches for Sri Lanka across 
all formats, amassing a remarkable 21,032 runs 
and taking 440 wickets. Known as one of the most 
dangerous opening batters of his era, Jayasuriya has 
also served as a selector and is currently the full-
time Cricket Consultant for Sri Lanka Cricket. His 
vast experience and strategic insight are expected to 
be invaluable as he takes on this crucial role.
Upcoming Challenges
Jayasuriya's first challenge as head coach will be the 
home series against India, featuring three ODIs and 
three T20Is. This will be followed by a three-match 
Test series against England, starting on August 21, 
with the first Test in Manchester and the remaining 
two in London at Lord's and The Oval.
Ashley De Silva, CEO of Sri Lanka Cricket, 
expressed confidence in Jayasuriya's appointment, 
stating, "Sanath, with his wealth of international 
cricketing experience, is well-positioned to guide 
the national team until we find a permanent 
solution."
