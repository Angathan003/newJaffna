Chavakachcheri 
Hospital Controversy: 
A Reflection on Our 
Values and Future
The Chavakachcheri hospital issue has become a 
focal point, stirring much debate and discussion, 
particularly on the not-so-content Jaffna YouTube 
channel, Facebook, and diasporic YouTube channels.
At the center of this controversy is Dr. Aruchuchuna, 
who, in true Tamil fashion, has exaggeratedly linked 
this issue to the legendary Kurukshetra War from 
the Mahabharata, subtly stirring the sentiments of 
the common people. His portrayal of himself as 
Lord Krishna, evident in his social media posts and 
narcissistic comments during a television interview, 
as well as his never-ending Facebook Live sessions, 
has only added to the sensationalism.
Jaffna YouTubers, who have been content-less

type of videos, found a newfound adrenaline rush, 
creating tons of videos, shorts, reels, and whatnot. 
Our so-called Tamil nationalist politicians, who 
always seem to be "waiting for someone to die so 
they can dance," and our diaspora, who thrive on 
chaos in Jaffna, have all jumped on the bandwagon, 
making it a big buzz.
As a responsible media outlet, the Jaffna Monitor 
refrains from sensationalizing this issue. Unlike other

platforms that thrive on controversy, our restraint is not due to a lack 
of interest or concern but stems from a desire to avoid being part of 
the media frenzy that often obscures the real issues. Therefore, we are 
choosing not to report on this matter now. We apologize to our readers 
who may have expected coverage from us, but our approach will help 
maintain focus on the more significant underlying problems.
This unfolding saga has inadvertently shone a spotlight on the 
notorious practices of the Government Medical Officers' Association 
(GMOA). Astonishingly, this trade union wields the power to 
transfer doctorsâ€”a responsibility that typically lies with government 
authorities. Moreover, the GMOA holds the authority to issue tax-free 
vehicle permits, highlighting their undue influence and power. Their 
reputation is marred by allegations of thuggery and highhandedness.
For instance, Dr. Mayuran, who holds a position within the GMOA, 
worked at Tellipalai Hospital but traveled to Chavakachcheri Hospital 
during his duty time and attacked Dr. Archchuna. This incident vividly 
illustrates that the GMOA is more than just a trade union; it operates 
like a group of thugs.
Additionally, this saga sheds light on the dire conditions in base 
hospitals like Chavakachcheri and many others, raising a critical 
question about operating these hospitals to their full capacity. 
Addressing this issue could significantly reduce the burden on 
teaching hospitals.
A disturbing trend has emerged that unfairly accuses every doctor, 
with social media warriors launching a digital Kurukshetra against our 
medical professionals and resorting to below-the-belt criticism. We 
must all remember one crucial point: many Sri Lankan Tamils often 
dream of emigrating for a better life. Thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils 
recently migrated to Canada following relaxed visa requirements. 
Despite this trend, a notable number of consultants and surgeons 
resisted the allure of foreign life and returned to Sri Lanka after 
completing their mandatory foreign training. Although they had 
opportunities to stay abroad for higher earnings and better prospects, 
their commitment to serving their homeland and Jaffna brought them 
back. Such baseless accusations overlook their dedication. If these 
professionals decide to leave again, the impact on our society would 
be profound and detrimental.
At Jaffna Monitor, we are aware that many surgeons and physicians

are now regretting their decision to return to Sri Lanka and are 
contemplating leaving again. Additionally, those currently undergoing 
foreign training might choose not to come back. Driving them away 
will only result in losing invaluable medical expertise and care for our 
community.
This exodus would create a vacuum in our healthcare system, 
exacerbating the challenges faced by an already strained sector. 
The dedication of these medical professionals is a lifeline for many, 
and their potential departure would not only diminish the quality of 
healthcare but also hinder the progress and well-being of our society.
Moreover, the potential departure of these medical professionals would 
exacerbate the already challenging conditions in our hospitals. Many 
base hospitals, like those in Jaffna, struggle with inadequate resources 
and personnel. The loss of experienced surgeons and physicians would 
only deepen this crisis, leaving countless patients without access to 
critical medical care.
Before casting accusations, we must remember the dedication of 
doctors like Dr. Peranantharaja, an eminent consultant who devoted 
his entire life to the people of Jaffna. He never even owned a bike 
and often commuted by cycle. Recall Dr. Lakshman, a cardiologist 
who faithfully reported to duty at Jaffna Hospital even while his wife 
was terminally ill with cancer. Remember Dr. Gowri, a consultant 
beloved by patients who called her "Amman" (goddess), who remained 
unmarried and committed her entire life to the welfare of the Jaffna 
people, and many more.
Let us not forget these exemplary individuals who sacrificed personal 
comfort and ambitions to serve their community. Their dedication 
should inspire us to support and cherish our medical professionals 
rather than drive them away with unfounded criticisms.
