A conclave of narratives
T
he tsunami of fans that filled the 
picturesque Marine Drive in Mumbai was 
a testament to the power of sport. It unites 
people like nothing else, even as it has the 
potential to divide. This power arises not 
solely from the action that unfolds in the 
middle but from the narratives woven around 
the action.
India's win in the World T20 is a triumph 
for the ages, purely for cricketing reasons 
alone. However, the narratives that unfolded 
alongside the win make it unmatched in recent 
cricketing history. Among the many stories, a 
few truly stand out.
The first story is the most unspoken about 
Axar Patel. Axar has been an eternal 
bridesmaid, often overshadowed by Ravi 
Jadeja. But this was his day. He kept India 
A final like no other:

afloat with the bat and 
cleaned up Stubbs at a crucial 
juncture. Yet, Klaasen's 
onslaught, through no fault 
of Axar's, could have left 
him with the stigma of being 
labeled as the man who cost 
India the match despite doing 
everything he could. Imagine 
the plight he would have had 
to endure. As loving as India 
can be, it can also be beyond 
brutal. It would have been 
an injustice of unimaginable 
proportions, but fortunately 
for Axar, it turned out 
otherwise.
For Virat Kohli, it was a similar narrative. 
Kohli played anchor and propelled India 
to a score that should have been adequate 
if not for the Klaasen show. It seemed as 
though his efforts might be in vain until the 
bowlers triumphed. Had the result turned out 
differently, Kohli would have been chastised 
for the conservative approach he took, as 
always. Context wouldn't have mattered. 
Imagine a man who has made the unthinkable 
the norm walking out with the blame for 
losing a World T20 final. Thankfully for 
Kohli, it turned out otherwise.
But unlike the above two, one man would 
have wished for the ground to swallow him 
up had he not defended the last over: Hardik 
Pandya. Sixteen runs from six deliveries may 
seem like a lot, but the pressure could have 
been immense if it came down to ten off five. 
Pandya's redemption arc is a story of its own. 
He played a pivotal role in instilling hope for

India in his brilliant way, but 
all that could have been lost 
had that ball traveled for a six.
No one can say for sure, but 
it was a bet Pandya couldn't 
afford to take. The ball that 
seemed destined to be a 
maximum turned out to be a 
wicket, thanks to the magical 
Suryakumar Yadav. The skill 
was special, but considering 
the Mumbai Indians saga, 
it's poetic that the man 
considered competition for 
Hardik came to his rescue. 
Hardik's day could have been 
different, which would have 
made matters worse, but 
thankfully for him, it turned 
out otherwise.
Finally, it's the man who 
made all this possible: Rohit 
Sharma. Taking over Kohli's 
captaincy under controversial 
circumstances, Rohit worked 
his magic on this team. 
Winning World title finals 
across formats doesn't happen 
the way it has for India, 
especially after the trauma 
of the World Cup 2023. It 
would have been a travesty 
for Rohit to have a near miss. 
His leadership legacy in the 
international arena would 
have been less glittering. It 
seemed like it would be until 
the magic unraveled at the 
end. Thankfully for Rohit and 
India, it turned out otherwise.
That's the beauty of sport. 
It heads in one direction 
and makes a U-turn when 
you least expect it. Results 
change, and with that, narratives change. Narratives drive 
emotions and what follows thereafter. Usually, it's one or 
two narratives, but that beautiful day in Barbados changed 
the themes of multiple narratives for many individuals 
with different stories, all for the good. This is what makes 
that final unlike any otherâ€”a final with multiple beautiful 
narratives for the ages.
