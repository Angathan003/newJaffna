ust a few weeks before the 2015 
presidential election, the late 
Rajavarothiam Sampanthan admitted that 
the annihilation of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had liberated 
his political alliance-the Tamil National 
Alliance (TNA), which he headed-from 
the clutches of the LTTE.
Sampanthan, who led the alliance for 
23 years, addressed this issue when an 
English newspaper journalist raised it at a 
special press conference called by the TNA 
in Colombo to announce its decision to 
back Maithripala Sirisena's candidature at 
the 2015 presidential election.
At the time, the TNA declared its 
support for Maithripala Sirisena, and 
its parliamentary group consisted of 14 
MPs, making it the third-largest group in 
Parliament.
The journalist sought an explanation from 
Sampanthan regarding several issues:
1.	 Did the TNA probe its own conduct 
as a political party, particularly 
its controversial 2001 decision 
to recognize the LTTE as the 
sole representative of the Tamil-
speaking people?
2.	 Why did the TNA ask the Tamil 
electorate to boycott the November 
2005 presidential election?
3.	 What led to the TNA backing 
retired General Sarath Fonseka in 
the 2010 presidential election?
In response, Sampanthan declared that 
both the government and the Opposition 
had the freedom to operate because the 
LTTE no longer existed. He stressed that 
the LTTE had been a ruthless militant 
organization and admitted that the TNA 
had also been freed from the LTTE's 
influence.
The TNA leader justified the recognition 
of the LTTE as the sole representative of 
the Tamil-speaking people on the basis 
that both then-President Chandrika 
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's government 
and the UNP wanted to have talks with 
the group.
Commenting on the November 2005 
polls boycott, Sampanthan claimed that 
the Tamil electorate had no option but to 
abide by the LTTE directive. He did not 
comment on the TNA having to issue that 
directive on behalf of the LTTE.
