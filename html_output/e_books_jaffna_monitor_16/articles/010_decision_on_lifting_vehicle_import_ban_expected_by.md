Decision

Import Ban 
Expected by 
Mid-August
Monitor Memo
Finance State Minister Ranjith Siambalapitiya 
has announced that the final decision on 
lifting the ban on vehicle imports will be 
made by the second week of August. This 
announcement comes amid soaring vehicle 
prices in Sri Lanka, with the ban severely 
impacting the availability and affordability of 
vehicles.
The committee assigned to review the import 
ban issue met on July 4 and is expected to 
present its final report to the Cabinet by mid-
August. Minister Siambalapitiya expressed 
optimism that the import of vehicles can 
be resumed without adversely affecting the 
country's exchange rate while also addressing 
the urgent needs of the people.
"The import order will prioritize public 
transport vehicles, goods transport vehicles, 
alternative vehicles, general vehicles, and 
private vehicles," the Minister stated. This 
structured approach aims to balance economic 
considerations with public demand.
Since the implementation of the ban, vehicle 
prices in Sri Lanka have skyrocketed. A 
second-hand motorbike, which previously 
sold for less than 2.5 lakhs, is now 
unaffordable for many. Similarly, cars 
available for 25 lakhs before the ban are now 
being sold for 60 lakhs, creating significant 
financial strain for the populace.
Additionally, Minister Siambalapitiya 
informed Parliament that the Cabinet has 
approved the import of 1,000 vehicles 
specifically for the tourism industry. This 
includes 250 buses and 750 vans, which 
require approval from the Tourism Ministry. 
Despite this approval, none of these vehicles 
have been imported yet.
