Our Systems Need Change. However,

t's disheartening to witness our society's decline. We live in 
a world where people blindly follow fleeting trends, embrace 
baseless conspiracies, and idolize so-called 'heroes.' Social media, 
mistakenly seen as the entirety of our world, fuels this misguided 
worship. A society driven by the relentless pursuit of dopamine 
surges, seeking instant gratification at every turn, will never 
foster genuine community, nor will it cultivate true progress and 
enlightenment.
Everyone acknowledges that our systems—political, healthcare, 
educational, and beyond—need change. However, believing

that such change can occur instantly is 
misguided. While it's true that change must 
start somewhere, the most successful and 
sustainable transformations begin quietly 
and progress gradually. Day-to-day or even 
month-to-month changes might seem 
negligible, but over time, the cumulative effect 
is significant.
One example I always cite when my juniors 
complain about internships as part of our 
training is the gradual transformation it 
brings. You might not notice the knowledge 
and skills you acquire each day, but consider 
the year-long training and how it transforms 
you as a doctor compared to your first 
day. Over time, these incremental changes 
accumulate, leading to significant personal 
and professional growth. The challenges 
and experiences faced during internships 
build resilience, enhance practical skills, 
and deepen your understanding of medical 
practice. By the end of the internship, the 
transformation is profound, shaping you into 
a more competent and confident healthcare 
professional.
Though this is an example of personal 
change, it applies to society as a whole 
because it reflects the behavior and growth 
of individuals within it. Just as interns 
gradually become proficient in their field, 
society progresses through the collective, 
incremental improvements of its members. 
These small, consistent changes contribute to 
the overall advancement and betterment of 
the community, highlighting the importance 
of patience, persistence, and long-term 
commitment to achieving meaningful societal 
transformation.
Sudden, flashy changes often signal 
underlying issues. Though these stunts 
might initially bring smiles, they ultimately 
destabilize existing systems without yielding 
long-term benefits. A recent example is 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa's presidency. His 
dramatic tax cuts initially pleased the 
populace but led to long-term sorrow, 
resulting in the same people who elected 
him rallying for his removal. He was elected 
with a mandate for "systemic change," yet the 
abruptness of his policies led to failure.
True leaders must think laterally and make 
decisions with careful consideration of the 
circumstances. They should embrace their 
employees and the people they serve, moving 
forward collectively along the right path. 
Genuine leadership doesn't seek publicity; 
the changes they implement are often too 
minute to capture immediate public attention. 
However, the public will recognize and 
appreciate these changes once they start 
manifesting in the community.
As a proud Jaffna Hindu old boy, it fills me 
with immense pride to see my school excelling 
not only in academics but also in sports. It's a 
proud moment for our college. Our Principal, 
Ratnam Senthilmaran, achieved these 
feats over the years, not in days or months. 
Everyone remembers the status of JHC when 
he was appointed as principal, but now it's 
time to harvest what he cultivated over the last 
few years. Hopefully, he will be remembered 
as one of the greatest principals of JHC.
I have never met him in person or talked 
to him, but I have silently admired his 
leadership in taking the college forward. He 
is a true example of a leader. We need more 
leaders like him to build this society anew. 
His approach, characterized by patience, 
dedication, and a vision for long-term success, 
is what truly brings about meaningful and 
lasting transformation.
