Pixelated Punchlines 
The semifinal match of the grand soft tennis cricket competition hosted by the 
Ariyalai Killadies recently took place at the Ariyalai Saraswathi Sports Ground.
The match was kicked off by Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the opposition and the 
United People's Power, along with Umasanthira Prakash, the Deputy Secretary of the 
United People's Power, who graced the event as honored guests.
But here's the kicker—literally! What stole the show was this snapshot: the "Man of 
the Match" proudly receiving a cash prize of 1,000 rupees from Sajith. Now, here’s 
the funny part—the grand, elaborately decorated check they handed over must 
have cost more to make than the actual prize money! It had everyone chuckling and 
wondering if they should frame the check as a work of art.
"Check" This Out: When 1,000 
Rupees Sparked a Smile

n the famous Tamil movie Vada 
Chennai, there's a memorable 
line where Kishore's character says, 
"mtd; nghUis vLj;J mtidNa 
NghlZk;>" loosely translating to "Take 
his weapon and kill him." The North-
East Intellectuals Organization almost 
did the same to the proponents of the 
so-called common Tamil candidate.
This North-East Intellectuals 
Organization has thrown its support 
behind Ranil Wickremesinghe, 
directly opposing the Tamil common 
candidate for the upcoming elections. 
They reasoned that even LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran recognized 
Wickremesinghe's knack for bold and 
decisive actions and stated that Ranil's 
leadership was crucial for the Tamil 
community. The organization indirectly 
said they support Ranil by following 
their dear leader, Prabhakaran.
What's amusing is that the people 
working against Ranil's prospects by 
proposing the common Tamil candidate 
are die-hard LTTE and Prabhakaran 
fans. These LTTE enthusiasts are now 
left in a state of confusion, unsure 
whether to support this statement or 
not.
They've been handed a plot twist 
straight out of a political thriller!

LTTE Loyalists Caught in 
a Ranil Riddle!
