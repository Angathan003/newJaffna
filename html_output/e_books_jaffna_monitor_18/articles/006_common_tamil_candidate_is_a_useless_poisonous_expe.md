"W
e must campaign 
among the people 
against the common Tamil 
candidate for the presidential 
election. This matter is 
a farcical play, a useless 
poisonous experiment," 
declared M.A. Sumanthiran, 
Member of Parliament from 
the Tamil National Alliance 
and a leading figure in Ilankai 
Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK). 
He made these remarks at a 
recently held event in Jaffna 
titled "The Tamil People's 
Self-Determination Rights 
and Public Referendum." This 
political forum, organized 
by Sumanthiran, aimed to 
gather various opinions on the 
Tamil community's stance in 
the presidential election and, 
on the sly, to gently nudge 
aside those advocating for a 
common Tamil candidate.

I invited those advocating for a common Tamil 
candidate to a meeting to discuss the prospects 
of such a candidate for the presidential 
election," explained M.A. Sumanthiran. "They 
initially committed to attend. However, when 
approached later, they informed me that they 
are a 'group' and their group had collectively 
decided to abstain from participating, thus 
withdrawing their earlier commitment. I 
still have this message saved on my phone," 
he noted. He also mentioned that the group 
promoting the common Tamil candidate 
included a so-called political writer. "When 
I invited the writer to attend the meeting 
and share his opinions, he replied that he 
was part of a group that had decided not to 
participate, and therefore, he could not attend," 
Sumanthiran said.
Sumanthiran pondered the reasons behind 
the refusal of some to attend the meeting, 
suspecting that their motivations might stem 
from a reluctance to tolerate differing opinions, 
which he likened to a form of fascism. He 
stated, "It is a fundamental democratic 
principle to present various opinions to the 
public. Opinions should engage and challenge 
each other. To suppress the expression of 
opinions is tantamount to fascism. When we 
seek to discuss and share such vital issues with 
the public, it is perplexing why those who opt 
out would effectively align themselves with 
such undemocratic principles." This was his 
reflection on the matter.
In his address, Sumanthiran articulated a firm 
and reasoned opposition to the proposal of a 
common Tamil candidate, characterizing it as 
detrimental and ill-conceived. He emphasized 
that the community's united stance should 
not be interpreted as desperation but as a 
reaffirmation of their deeply held values.
He highlighted why the proposal for a 
common Tamil candidate does not align with 
the principles of a standard referendum or 
collective electoral decision, as claimed by the 
so-called supporters of the common Tamil 
candidate. He noted that a presidential election 
is fundamentally different. According to

Sumanthiran, in the forthcoming presidential 
election, voters are expected to support a 
candidate they genuinely believe is suited to 
lead the nation rather than backing what he 
views as an alternative political maneuver.
Therefore, he considers the proposal 
of a common Tamil candidate not only 
unnecessary but also counterproductive, 
risking the integrity and autonomy of the Sri 
Lankan Tamil community. He argues that 
endorsing this initiative would renounce their 
sovereignty and right to self-determination—
rights as essential as life itself. Sumanthiran's 
stance suggests supporting such a candidate 
would betray the community's fundamental 
values and principles.
Hitting hard at the so-called civil societies, 
Sumanthiran stated, "An election is a political 
activity. Such political activities should be led 
by political leaders and political parties. Civil 
society has a role here; they can advise, and 
their advice is welcome. However, this is a 
political event. The people did not elect civil 
society members for this political event. They 
elected us. The mandate of the people is with 
us. The responsibility to make decisions lies in 
our hands. We cannot relinquish that. If we do, 
we would be neglecting our responsibilities."
Sumanthiran expressed strong concerns about 
the prospects for a common Tamil candidate 
in the forthcoming election, noting that even 
with full participation, support for such a 
candidate would likely not surpass 20 percent.
He emphasized that it is inadequate to simply 
reject this candidate; instead, there is a critical 
need for active campaigning against him. 
He explained that this proactive approach 
is essential to clarify that any defeat of this 
candidate does not reflect the community's 
core political beliefs but is instead the result of 
external manipulations. "As a representative 
of a major Tamil party, it is our solemn 
responsibility to oppose this vigorously within 
our community," he asserted.
Furthermore, Sumanthiran urged his party

members to remain steadfast and resist any 
fears of being labeled as traitors. "We must 
stand firm, as our party has always been a 
staunch advocate for the welfare and survival 
of our people. Therefore, it is crucial that we 
strongly confront any actions that threaten our 
established stance," he stressed.
Sumanthiran highlighted the pivotal role of 
Tamil votes in shaping the outcomes of Sri 
Lanka's presidential elections. He noted that in 
the last three presidential elections, where only 
two main candidates contended, the Tamil 
electorate was decisive in the 2015 elections. 
However, with the upcoming election 
featuring three prominent candidates—Ranil 
Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, and 
Anura Kumara Dissanayake—Tamil votes 
are anticipated to exert even more significant 
influence. He also stressed that if Tamils unite, 
they can play an important role in electing the 
Sri Lankan president.
Furthermore, Sumanthiran mentioned that 
since President Ranil Wickremesinghe has yet 
to announce his candidacy, formal discussions 
with him have not taken place. Dialogue 
with the other candidates, Sajith Premadasa 
and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who have 
expressed their willingness to talk, is on the 
agenda. Sumanthiran is pressing President 
Wickremesinghe to undertake specific pre-
election actions that reflect his commitment 
to addressing the concerns of the Tamil 
community. These actions, he insists, must be 
demonstrated before any further engagement.
Sumanthiran levied sharp criticism at the 
Tamil National People's Front (TNPF) for their 
stance of boycotting the presidential election. 
He drew a historical parallel to the 2005 
election when LTTE chief Prabhakaran's order 
to boycott the presidential election directly led 
to Mahinda Rajapaksa's win—a presidency 
that saw the ultimate defeat and demise of 
Prabhakaran himself. Sumanthiran noted that 
the TNPF is repeating this folly. He subtly 
hinted that the TNPF should avoid practicing 
witchcraft at their own expense, much like 
Prabhakaran did in 2005.
