.V. "Sugi" Ganeshananthan, an American 
fiction writer, essayist, and journalist 
of Sri Lankan Tamil descent, is a formidable 
presence in modern English literature. 
 
Her debut novel, "Love Marriage" (2008), 
juxtaposes the landscapes of Sri Lanka and 
North America, intricately weaving the impact 
of Sri Lankan politics on familial dynamics. 
This acclaimed work was honored among 
The Washington Post Book World's Best of 
2008 and longlisted for the Orange Prize, 
establishing her as a literary tour de force. 
 
"Brotherless Night" (2023), her second novel,

Excerpts from Our Interview with V.V. 
Ganeshananthan
How do you feel about giving an 
interview to a magazine based in 
Jaffna, a place with which you have a 
hereditary connection?
I'm always thrilled to talk to people in Jaffna 
or those who care about Jaffna! Thank you for 
reaching out to me.
Can you share more about your 
research process for "Brotherless 
Night"? 
I read extensively—books by authors 
from many different vantage points and 
communities. This included scholarly and 
journalistic accounts, memoirs, and general 
histories. I also interviewed many people who 
lived through this period. In this way, I hope 
to understand both the incompleteness of each 
story and its specific truth.
How do you approach character 
development, especially when dealing 
with historical and political contexts?

January 2023  
The people I read about and spoke 
to were affected by politics, and 
so am I. I've been influenced by 
events like the election of Barack 
Obama, the election of Donald 
Trump, 9/11, and the pandemic. 
By reflecting on how political and 
historical events in my lifetime 
have impacted me, I could 
imagine how political events of the 
1980s—such as the burning of the 
Jaffna Public Library—affected my 
characters.
The people I interviewed 
provided specific details about 
their relationships to events that 
history books now regard as major 
occurrences, often described with 
considerable distance. The library 
burned, but many people were 
employed there, studied there, and 
loved its collections. When my 
character Dayalan works there, 
he develops a very distinctive 
relationship with history, as do his 
siblings who study at the library.
Your book includes some 
details that differ from 
historical or factual 
accounts, such as the 
inclusion of practical tests 
in A/L exams and the idea 
that it is rare for someone to 
top the island on their first 
try. How do you view the role 
of such creative liberties 
in your storytelling? How 
do you balance the need 
for factual accuracy with the creative freedom 
of fiction, and what challenges do you face in 
maintaining this balance?
...I tried to be as factually correct as was interesting." 
That's from the beginning of Gerontius by James 
Hamilton-Paterson. A beloved teacher of mine used 
to quote that to us, and I heard it around the time I 
started working on this book. The facts as they stand 
are interesting to me, or I wouldn't have been drawn 
to this moment in history, but I knew I wasn't going to 
represent them precisely; that would mean I might as 
well have written nonfiction. I generally tried to know

when I was sticking to the facts and when I 
wasn't, but sometimes I thought I had invented 
something, only to discover that something 
very close to my creation had occurred. That 
was always curiously satisfying—a sign that 
somehow I'd marinated in the research so 
much that my subconscious knew what had 
occurred even when my conscious self did not. 
Of course, the opposite sometimes occurred, 
too: I would think I had portrayed something 
accurately, only to have someone tell me I had 
aimed and missed.
All that said, people's preferences on this 
point—facts in fiction, historical accuracy 
in fiction—vary quite a lot and in ways that 
are difficult to predict. So, in the end, the 
measure I had to use was my own interest and 
satisfaction. What facts did I want to include, 
even on an inarticulable level? How could I 
know and verify them? Which details were 
more malleable or represented emotional 
truths that were valuable to the story? 
The practical exams are a good example. I 
personally hate dissection and have also heard 
many stories from people who belonged to 
earlier generations and had to do practical 
exams. So I had spent a lot of time imagining 
that and wanted to put it in. That had the 
added benefit of foreshadowing some choices 
and challenges Sashi faces later on in the story.
You chose to write about events and 
experiences that you did not personally 
live through. What perspectives and 
insights do you believe you bring to 
literature by writing from second-hand 
experiences? Although you did not 
live through the events described in 
your book, do you have any personal 
connections or experiences that 
influenced your writing?
A good deal of historical fiction is written by 
people who did not live through the periods 
they depict and who are working with some 
amount of distance in terms of time and place,

so in that regard, when I began the project, I 
knew I was not unusual. And I felt that Jaffna 
in the 1980s was as worthy of that kind of 
scrutiny as any other period. I did think that 
my ties to the community—the hereditary 
connection to which you refer—and my 
specific training as a journalist and fiction 
writer might mean that I could aim to create 
a depiction that offered both broad historical 
perspective and intensely individualized 
details. I had grown up with some stories 
about this time and place and accounts shared 
by people in my community, and those piqued 
my interest, so I wanted to learn more.
The book offered an unparalleled opportunity 
to achieve that. Some measures of distance 
were useful, and so was collapsing that 
distance, which I was able to do with the aid of 
people I already knew and others I met during 
the course of studying this period. In other 
words, I felt that my inherited understanding 
and connections were enough to push me to 
begin, but they left me with enough questions 
that I wanted to write the book. I did not know 
in advance how it would turn out, and if I had, 
I wouldn't have needed to write it.
Do you have any plans to write about 
the second-generation Tamil diaspora, 
a demographic of growing importance 
with which you have firsthand 
experience? 
The main character and storyline of my 
first novel, Love Marriage, are diasporic. It's 
possible I will return to that landscape at some 
point, but I will probably go on to new terrain 
first.

What impact do you hope your book 
will have on readers, both within the 
Tamil diaspora and beyond? What 
themes do you want them to take 
away?
My feelings about the book aren't quite so 
directed, but on the most basic level, I hope 
people understand it as an invitation to engage 
with history and the present. Which version of 
the story did you know? What other versions 
might exist? I hope people think about who 
explains history, who is expected to explain 
it, which tellers we trust, and why. Who has 
authority? Who do we think is the audience 
for a story like this one? What do we expect of 
them? Why does that include or exclude you, 
and what kind of power does that give you?
What kind of feedback have you 
received from the Tamil community 
and other readers regarding your 
portrayal of the civil conflict and its 
aftermath?
Most strikingly, I've heard from a number of 
Tamil readers who told me that the book made 
space for their families to talk about things 
like Black July or the war when they hadn't 
previously done so. I didn't expect that, and 
it really astonished me the first time I had a 
friend say that my parents and I never talked 
about this openly until we all read your book, 
even though my family was affected by what 
happened. In some cases, I learned that people 
I had thought comparatively removed from 
the war had actually had close experiences of 
violence.
People have also offered surprising and 
persuasive interpretations that have taught 
me about my own work. I've been especially 
happy to hear from Tamil speakers and Tamil 
heritage speakers who see the influence of

Tamil in my English sentences.
Who or what are your major 
influences and inspirations in 
writing, particularly in relation 
to "Brotherless Night"?
I'm an admirer of A. Sivanandan, 
Shyam Selvadurai, Romesh 
Gunesekara, and Shoabsakthi. I also 
love the work of Jamaica Kincaid 
and Elizabeth McCracken, as well 
as writing by Jo Ann Beard, Rohini 
Mohan, Meera Srinivasan, Namini 
Wijedasa, Yiyun Li, James Alan 
McPherson, Colson Whitehead, 
and Michael Chabon. You can 
see how I'm mixing nonfiction 
and fiction writers together here! 
When I was writing Brotherless 
Night, I repeatedly turned to The 
Broken Palmyra and other works 
by members of University Teachers 
for Human Rights (Jaffna). I am 
particularly grateful for the words 
of Rajani Thiranagama and Rajan 
Hoole, from which I drew the 
epigraphs of Brotherless Night.
You have visited Sri Lanka and 
Jaffna recently. How do you 
see the positive and negative 
aspects of these places and 
the people?
I love traveling to Sri Lanka and 
Jaffna, but my recent travels have 
been somewhat constrained, so I 
can't generalize too much. I was 
most recently in Colombo, Kandy, 
and Jaffna, so I don't know much 
about what's going on in the East or South. I saw 
many ordinary Sri Lankans struggling with the 
increased costs of living and experiencing the effects of 
climate change. I also noticed increases in traffic and 
construction, as well as a sizable military presence that 
remains a decade and a half after the end of the war. 
Despite all this, people are doing their best to organize 
and improve their circumstances. I am heartened to 
see that some conversations are occurring across the 
usual divides, though there is still more work to do.
As a writer, can literature build a bridge 
between the Tamil and Sinhala communities?
I think literature is important, but it is not sufficient on 
its own. Literature cannot replace political will, good 
governance, or peace with justice and security for all 
communities. However, I do hope it helps people to 
imagine a better society, which is at least a beginning.
