affna – In a twist that seems 
straight out of a comedy, the Kayts 
Magistrate's Court has ordered an 
investigation into a curious case 
where confiscated alcohol turned 
into a tea-like substance while under 
police custody in Neduntheevu.
It all started when a local man was 
arrested by the Neduntheevu police 
for possessing an excessive number 
of alcohol bottles. He was promptly 
brought to court, where the 
evidence—carefully sealed alcohol 
bottles—was presented.
During the trial, the suspect 
admitted to his boozy stash, leading 
the court to fine him and allow him 
to keep up to 10 bottles, while the 
rest were to be destroyed. However, 
when the police returned the 
permitted 10 bottles, the suspect 
noticed something strange. Instead 
of the familiar sight of his cherished 
spirits, he found bottles containing 
a suspiciously tea-like liquid with 
sediment settled at the bottom.
Raising eyebrows and perhaps 
a chuckle, the suspect lodged a 
complaint with the court registrar, 
subtly suggesting that the police 
might have enjoyed his alcohol 
and replaced it with tea. After all,

what better way to beat the summer heat than with a 
refreshing cup of... confiscated evidence?
After receiving the written complaint, the registrar 
brought this amusingly odd situation to the attention 
of the magistrate, who has now ordered a full 
investigation into this peculiar transformation. Was it 
a case of misplaced priorities or just an honest mistake 
by officers with a penchant for tea? The people of Jaffna 
wait eagerly for the answers.
As the investigation unfolds, some in Jaffna are 
comparing this mysterious transformation to a well-
known biblical miracle. "If Jesus turned water into 
wine, it seems our local police have performed the 
reverse miracle—turning wine into tea!" joked one 
amused local.
