I
t can be firmly stated that no other Sri 
Lankan has been subjected to global 
scholarly scrutiny to the extent that 
Ananda Coomaraswamy has. No other 
multi-talented Sri Lankan scholar has 
achieved such worldwide fame. Despite 
the vast knowledge available globally about 
Ananda Coomaraswamy, it is evident 
that there have not been comprehensive 
records about the remarkable women 
who were his wives. Through their lives, 
it becomes clear that Coomaraswamy's 
love and involvement with these women 
were not merely due to physical attraction 
or sexual desire. Ananda Coomaraswamy 
significantly supported and refined the 
personalities of these four women.
Similarly, the contributions of these four 
women were indispensable to the success 
of all of Coomaraswamy's work. He

collaborated with all four of them in his artistic and literary 
endeavors. He effectively utilized their talents in his artistic, 
literary, and research activities. The works he created in 
this manner were published with the names of his wives 
alongside his own.
In other words, it is reasonable to question whether Ananda 
Coomaraswamy could have achieved worldwide fame or 
accomplished so many works and achievements without 
the support of these four women. However, detailed records 
about these women are not available as a comprehensive 
collection anywhere. Instead, it is necessary to gather 
information piecemeal from various books and articles, 
extracting bits from here and there.
Ethel Mary Coomaraswamy
Ethel Mary Coomaraswamy (Ethel Mary Mairet, February 
17, 1872 - November 18, 1952) is globally known as a British 
handloom weaver. When discussing the development of 
handicrafts in the first half of the twentieth century, it is 
impossible to overlook Ethel Mary's role.
Ethel Mary Partridge was born in 1872 in Devon, England. 
She was educated domestically and later qualified to teach at 
the Royal Academy of Music in 1899, specializing in piano.
She married Ananda Coomaraswamy on June 19, 1902. 
At that time, Ethel was five years older than Ananda 
Coomaraswamy. The couple traveled to Sri Lanka, where 
Ananda Coomaraswamy joined a mineral research project. 
During this period, he wrote several articles on Sri Lanka's 
mineral resources, which were published in various 
scholarly journals. His research began in this field. They 
stayed in a bungalow near the city of Kandy. 1The couple 
documented the arts and crafts of every village they visited. 
They recorded details about each craft they observed 
and took photographs. After five years, they returned to 
England in 1907 and published their research on Sri Lanka's 
handicrafts.

Until 1910, they lived in Broad Campden. 
There, they collaborated with artisans like the 
architectural craftsman Charles Robert Ashbee 
to form and operate a group of craftsmen. 
Later, the couple revisited India and Sri Lanka 
to continue their artistic work.
Ethel independently learned the arts of 
weaving, dyeing, and spinning yarn. At a 
time when weaving by women was limited to 
household needs, she presented it as an art 
form and a professional craft. She became a 
significant role model for women interested in 
weaving and gained fame in the field.
In 1909, Ethel returned to England and 
conducted her first experiments in weaving 
and dyeing in Campden. She studied books 
on vegetable dyes at the Bodleian Library in 
Oxford and sought out places to learn weaving. 
Her knowledge of dyeing and creating color 
patterns through sewing might have been 
influenced by her father, a chemist, and her 
husband, Ananda Coomaraswamy, a botanist.
In December 1910, Ethel and Ananda 
Coomaraswamy traveled to India to continue 
their artistic work and research, writing about 
their discoveries. In 1910, Coomaraswamy 
openly engaged in another romantic 
relationship, which led to the end of his 
marriage with Ethel.
Ethel later built a house near Barnstaple with 
studios for dyeing and weaving. In 1913, she 
married Philip Mairet, and together they 
established The Thatched House, a communal 
home and studio. Her dream of a weaving 
workshop became a reality. Mahatma Gandhi 
visited her the following year, knowing about 
her work in Sri Lanka and India. Gandhi was 
keenly interested in using simple techniques 
for spinning khadi cloth in India.
In 1916, she published a book titled "A Book 
on Vegetable Dyes" in London, which is still 
celebrated as one of the pioneering books in 
the field. In 1917, she revised and expanded 
the book with additional details.
During the 1930s and 1940s, she provided 
training in weaving and dyeing at her studio, 
passing on her expertise to the next generation 
of artists.
Her dedication and innovation in the field 
brought her recognition in many countries. In 
1937, she received the Royal Society of Arts 
honorary award, becoming the first woman 
to receive this honor. 1939 she published 
"Handweaving Today" and taught at the 
Brighton School of Art from 1939 to 1947.
Throughout her life, Ethel remained active 
in her field, continuously guiding students 
and sending samples of her work to schools 
nationwide.
Ethel Mairet continues to influence generations 
of weavers. Her biography in the Oxford 
Dictionary of National Biography refers to her 
as the "mother of English handloom weaving." 
Her works are still displayed in museums, 
along with documents and memorabilia from 
1872-1952. These include personal documents, 
travel journals from 1910-1938, commercial 
and personal correspondence, account books, 
and photographs. Her works are still part of 
educational curricula today.
She married Ananda Coomaraswamy on June 
19, 1902, but they divorced in 1913. Ethel 
passed away in 1952 and was buried at St. 
Nicholas Church in Brighton.

Translator of the Mahavamsa
Although Ananda Coomaraswamy had a 
family background of Jaffna Tamil and English 
heritage, he is predominantly celebrated by 
the Sinhalese Buddhist community today. His 
research is still admired not only in the Eastern 
world but also in the Western world. His role 
in introducing Eastern arts, cultures, and 
literatures to the West is extensive.
In Sri Lanka's government school 
curriculum, the 9th-grade Sinhala language 
textbook includes 12 pages about Ananda 
Coomaraswamy. Even in Tamil textbooks, 
there is not as much detailed information 
about him. His works and books written 
in English have been translated into many 
languages. Most of his books have been 
translated into Sinhala, whereas only a few 
have been translated into Tamil. In other 
words, Ananda Coomaraswamy is not as well 
known in the Tamil community as he is in the 
Sinhalese community.
No other Sri Lankan has conducted as 
extensive research on Sinhalese heritage, 
culture, and literature as Ananda 
Coomaraswamy. This is why his works on the 
rediscovery of Sinhalese Buddhist community 
history are still celebrated by the Sinhalese 
community today.
In 1905, Wilhelm Geiger first brought the 
"Dipavamsa Mahavamsa" from Pali into 
German.2 Within the next three years, Ethel 
Mary Coomaraswamy translated it into 
English.3 Subsequently, Wilhelm Geiger, 
with the assistance of Mabel Haynes Bode, 
translated the Mahavamsa separately, which 
was published in 1912.4 Thus, the history of the 
Mahavamsa shows its translation from Pali to 
German, from German to English, and finally 
from English to Sinhala. While the names of 
everyone involved in the translation of the 
Mahavamsa, from Geiger to Mabel Haynes 
Bode, are deeply etched in history, Ethel 
Coomaraswamy, who first translated it into 
English, is not mentioned in any subsequent 
editions of the Mahavamsa. It is surprising 
to note that even in the 6th volume of the 
Mahavamsa published by the Sri Lankan 
government, while all the aforementioned 
names are mentioned, Ethel's name is 
conspicuously absent. Notably, she is not 
acknowledged anywhere in Sinhala records.5

Moreover, Wilhelm Geiger did not mention 
Ethel's assistance in the translation anywhere 
in the "Dipavamsa Mahavamsa." Due to 
the lack of records acknowledging Ethel's 
contribution to the Mahavamsa, her 
involvement is not even mentioned in the 
book "A Weaver's Life: Ethel Mairet 1872-
1952," which elaborates on her life.
In the same year, 1908, Ananda 
Coomaraswamy's book "Mediaeval Sinhalese 
Art" was published. It was his first book. 
Ethel's translation of the Mahavamsa had 
already been published before that. The book 
"Mediaeval Sinhalese Art" is a significant work 
celebrated by the Sinhalese community. In 
this book, Ananda Coomaraswamy references 
the Mahavamsa in many places. The Sinhala 
edition of this book has seen many reprints 
over the years.6 It is noted in textbooks for its 
historical importance as the first book to place 
Sri Lanka's artistic heritage on the world map.
His works and his contributions are considered 
significant in various university curricula. 
Notably, more is taught about him in Sinhala 
language textbooks than in Tamil language 
textbooks.
He married Ethel Mary in 1902 and lived with 
her until 1913. Despite being together for 
11 years, they did not have any children. In 
1907, Alice Ethel joined the Coomaraswamy 
couple's art group to work with them during 
this period. The following year, Ananda 
Coomaraswamy began a romantic relationship 
with Alice. Finally, Ananda Coomaraswamy 
openly told his wife, Ethel, that he intended 
to marry a second time. Ethel, who had not 
expected such a revelation, was shocked and 
left the house upon hearing it.7

Apart from the articles she co-authored with 
Ananda Coomaraswamy, Ethel's books can be 
listed as follows:
• Old Sinhalese Embroidery. 1906
• The Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa and Their

Ratan Devi (1913–1922)
Ananda Coomaraswamy's second wife, 
known as Ratan Devi, was actually Alice Ethel 
Richardson. Seeing that name, one might 
assume she was Tamil, but that is not the 
case. Ratan Devi's real name was Alice Ethel 
Richardson, and she was born in England 
in 1889. Ananda Coomaraswamy and Alice 
had two children, a son named Narada 
Coomaraswamy and a daughter named Rohini 
Coomaraswamy.

Ananda and Alice lived on a houseboat in 
Srinagar, Kashmir, India. Coomaraswamy 
studied Rajput painting, while Alice 
learned Indian music from Abdul Rahim of 
Kapurthala. As a result, in 1916, she published 
two volumes titled "Rajput Paintings." 8Upon 
their return to England, Alice performed 
Indian songs on various stages under the name 
"Ratan Devi." During this successful journey, 
they undertook many tours, where Alice would 
sing after Ananda Coomaraswamy's speeches.
In 1913, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Alice 
co-authored and published the book "Thirty 
Songs from the Punjab and Kashmir." They 
dedicated this book to their eldest son, 
Narada, whom they had long awaited.9 This 
book boasts two notable features: first, the 
songs include musical notation; second, the 
introduction was written by Rabindranath 
Tagore. During Ananda Coomaraswamy's 
visits to Calcutta, he stayed with Tagore as his 
guest. Tagore wrote a laudatory introduction 
about Alice's singing. The book received 
excellent reviews not only from newspapers 
but also from renowned personalities such as 
composer Percy Grainger, playwright George 
Bernard Shaw, and poet W.B. Yeats.10
Additionally, Ratan Devi published another 
book titled "Book of Words of Classic East 
Indian Ragas and Kashmiri Folk Songs 
Sung by Ratan Devi (Mrs. Ananda K. 
Coomaraswamy) in her Costume Recitals." 
This was published in New York by the J. B. 
Pond Lyceum Bureau.

On October 14, 1916, the renowned American 
magazine Musical America mentioned the 
Kashmir music journey of Ananda and Ratan 
Devi as follows:
'In the latter half of 1915-1916, one could 
witness the very interesting music programs 
featuring East Indian traditional ragas and 
Kashmiri folk songs by Ratan Devi and Dr. 
Ananda Coomaraswamy. The interest in these 
artists was so high that they could not meet all 
the demands. Therefore, they have decided to 
undertake a second American tour, which will 
begin on January 1.'11
In the same year, 1916, another American 
magazine published a detailed article 
about Ratan Devi's work in understanding, 
experiencing, and promoting Indian music. 
The article praised her elegance in playing

Indian music on the piano.12 Considering 
the news and articles published in various 
American magazines, it is evident13 that 
their contribution to introducing Eastern 
music, particularly Indian music, to Western 
audiences over a century ago is significant. 
Their work continues to be referenced in many 
studies today.
By 1917, their marital life had fractured. 
They initially lived separately and later 
divorced formally. Ananda Coomaraswamy 
explained his philosophical understanding 
of marriage and the reasons for his divorce 
in his book "The Dance of Shiva," under the 
essay titled "The Status of Indian Women."14 
He further explored his views and quests 
regarding domestic life and renunciation in 
his philosophical writings. His books like 
"Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism" serve as 
examples of this exploration.
Stella Bloch
Ananda Coomaraswamy's third wife, Stella 
Bloch, married him in 1922 when she was 
25 and he was 45, a 20-year age difference. 
They lived together until 1930. Born in 1897, 
Stella was an American dancer, journalist, and 
talented painter. She passed away on January 
10, 1999, just before her 101st birthday, having 
lived for 71 years after their divorce.
Stella Bloch met Ananda Coomaraswamy 
in America when she was 17 years old. She

traveled with him to learn about Eastern arts. 
They visited countries like Bali, Cambodia, 
China, India, Java, and Japan to learn about 
the arts there. During this period, it was Ratan 
Devi who taught her Indian dances.
Some of the famous photographs of Ananda 
Coomaraswamy were taken by Stella Bloch. 
Similarly, a well-known photograph of Stella 
that still exists today was taken by Ananda 
Coomaraswamy. Stella Bloch wrote and 
published a book titled "Dancing and the 
Drama East and West" in 1922, the same year 
they got married. The cover of this book bears 
the words "With an Introduction by Ananda 
Coomaraswamy." However, the introduction 
inside is dated 1921, indicating it was written a 
year before their marriage.
Though the book is quite short, with only 38 
pages, after excluding the blank pages, Ananda 
Coomaraswamy's 3-page introduction, and 
the 8 individual pages with illustrations, the 
actual content is just 13 pages. This short essay, 
containing fewer than 2,400 English words, 
was published as a book. All the line drawings 
in the book were done by Stella herself.

After separating from Coomaraswamy in 1931, 
Stella married American lyricist, producer, 
and actor Edward Eliscu. She wrote numerous 
research articles and produced many works 
while working at the Boston Museum of Fine 
Arts. Her paintings were used as logos for 
African American music productions, and her 
artworks are preserved at Princeton University 
and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
Viswanath, who wrote a book about her, noted 
that her house in Needham, Boston, was like 
a museum, filled with art objects from around 
the world.15
The details of the five articles she co-authored 
with Ananda Coomaraswamy can be found 
in a compilation of Coomaraswamy's works16 
prepared by Dr. Rama Ponnampalam 
Coomaraswamy.
Examples of Stella's books and articles include:

and West by Stella Bloch, New York, 1922.

Luisa Runstein (Dona Luisa Runstein)
In the same year, Ananda Coomaraswamy 
divorced Stella, and he married Luisa Runstein 
from Argentina, with whom he lived until 
he died in 1947. They had a 28-year age gap. 
Coomaraswamy met Luisa at a communist 
protest in Cambridge. Her parents were Jewish 
immigrants to Argentina, and she came to 
America at 16. Known as Xlata Llamas (Lotte 
Lamas), she was a prominent photographer.
Many of the photographs of Ananda 
Coomaraswamy that we have today were 
taken by Luisa. Her photography collection 
also includes beautiful photographs of 
Rabindranath Tagore. Some of these 
photographs were signed by Tagore himself. It 
is also known that the famous picture of Stella 
Bloch, Ananda Coomaraswamy's third wife, 
was taken by Luisa. Likewise, Luisa took the 
well-known side profile photograph of Ananda 
Coomaraswamy wearing a hat and leaning 
down, which was taken in 1937.
At that time, Luisa was only 25 years old. Their 
son, Rama Coomaraswamy, was born two 
years after their marriage. They lived for many 
years in a house near Boston. Although Rama

completed his early education at a conservative 
Hindu school in India, he later pursued higher 
education in the medical field and became a 
renowned doctor. Additionally, he converted 
to Christianity. He lived in countries like the 
United States and Canada for some time before 
moving to England, where he completed his 
postgraduate studies at Oxford and Harvard 
Colleges. He authored and published several 
research books on Christianity. Rama passed 
away in 2006 at the age of 75.
Luisa cared for Ananda Coomaraswamy 
with great concern until the end. She was 
also his assistant, helping with office work 
and research. It is noted that Luisa learned 
Hindi and Sanskrit in India. After Ananda 
Coomaraswamy's death, Luisa served as a 
guide to many who researched his works.
Ananda Coomaraswamy passed away on 
September 9, 1947, in America. His funeral 
was held at a Christian church, where eulogies 
by Luisa and their son, Rama Ponnampalam, 
were delivered. These speeches were later 
published in a memorial volume in 1952, five 
years after his death. The book, which contains 
420 pages, includes tributes and articles from 
various individuals, including the then Prime 
Minister of Sri Lanka, D.S. Senanayake. It was 
compiled by Durairajasingam. In her eulogy, 
Luisa said:
"Coomaraswamy spent his entire life learning, 
seeking knowledge, and continuously striving 
to understand himself. In all these pursuits, 
our deep interest acted as iron particles and 
your love, as the magnet that drew us in."
It is unfortunate that detailed and clear 
records of Luisa's life, who lived with Ananda 
Coomaraswamy for the last 17 years of his life, 
are not readily available. Those who wish to 
search for her photographs and articles can 
look under the name Zlata Llamas.
Luisa was not only known as an excellent 
photographer, but her articles published in 
some research journals under the name Dora 
Luisa Coomaraswamy also reveal her profound 
depth as a creator.
Luisa passed away in 1969 at the age of 65
