The ceremony was marked by a heartfelt 
tribute to those who perished, emphasizing 
the enduring impact of their loss on the 
community and the persistent brutality of 
the war. As the names of the victims were 
read aloud, the gathering stood in silent 
remembrance, reaffirming their commitment 
to honoring the memory of the fishermen and 
calling for justice and reconciliation.
On the early morning of June 10, 1986, the 
fishermen of Gurunagar set out aboard 
the boat "Thuya Oli" (Holy Light) toward 
Mandaitivu island, unaware of the horror 
awaited them. As they neared the islet, Sri 
Lankan Navy personnel, clad in ominous 
black uniforms, launched a ruthless ambush. 
Despite the fishermen's frantic attempts to 
signal their civilian status, the navy mercilessly 
destroyed their boats and nets before 
inflicting unimaginable torture and ultimately 
massacring them. Mr. Semon Mariyathas, 
then 41, was the sole miraculous survivor of 
that fateful day, yet he continues to bear deep 
physical and emotional scars.
The inquest held on June 26, 1986, led by 
the Magistrate under Inquest No. 9388, 
returned a verdict of homicide, unequivocally 
identifying the attackers as navy personnel. 
Medical evidence revealed the brutal nature of 
the attack, with all victims suffering multiple 
injuries from machine gunfire. The bodies of 
the fishermen bore signs of torture, with some 
having their eyes gouged out and stomachs 
slashed open, highlighting the sheer brutality 
inflicted upon them.
This year, a poignant ceremony was held at the 
monument commemorating the Mandaitivu 
Sea Massacre. The current memorial unveiled 
in 2004 on the massacre's 18th Anniversary, 
replaced an earlier memorial that was 
destroyed by the Sri Lankan Army during a 
military operation in 1996.

Tearful families and 
surviving relatives 
gathered to share stories 
of their lost loved ones. 
"The scars of that day 
remain fresh in our 
hearts," said one of the 
organizers. "We will 
never forget the brutality 
inflicted upon our 
people, nor will we cease 
our calls for justice. The 
Mandaitivu Sea Massacre 
symbolizes our enduring 
struggle."
The ceremony concluded 
with a candlelight vigil, 
each flame a tribute to 
the 31 martyrs, their 
names resonating 
through the air in a 
somber roll call of lost 
lives. The community's 
resolve to honor their 
memory remains 
unbroken, a beacon of 
hope amid enduring 
sorrow.
This annual 
remembrance is a 
reminder of the urgent 
need for justice and 
reconciliation in Sri 
Lanka. It calls upon all 
to acknowledge the past 
and strive for a future 
unmarred by such 
atrocities.
