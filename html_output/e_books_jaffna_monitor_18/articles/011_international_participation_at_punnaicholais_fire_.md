Sunday. Throughout the day, 
the temple grounds were 
filled with special prayers 
and the goddess's sea bathing 
ritual, highlighting the rich 
ceremonial heritage of the 
region.
The fire-walking ceremony 
was the focal point of the day. 
Foreign participants, alongside 
local devotees, walked across 
the bed of hot coals, fulfilling 
their vows in a profound 
display of faith and devotion.
The presence of foreign 
children, accompanied by their 
parents and supported by local 
community members, added 
a touching and heartwarming 
aspect to the ritual. These 
young participants, some 
experiencing Sri Lankan 
culture for the first time, 
exhibited remarkable courage 
and were met with cheers 
of encouragement from the 
crowd.
