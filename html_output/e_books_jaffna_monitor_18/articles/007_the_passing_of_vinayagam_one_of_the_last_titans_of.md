Vinayakamurthy, better known 
as Vinayagam, a leading figure in the 
LTTE's intelligence wing, succumbed to 
cancer on June 4 in France. His passing 
symbolizes the closure of a significant 
chapter, as he was among the last of the 
LTTE's senior intelligence members.
Prominent LTTE intelligence wing 
leaders who managed to evade 
the Sri Lankan military include 
Chiranjeevi Master, Pukalaenthi 
Master, Paramadeva, Thayaparan, and 
Vinayagam. Notably, Vinayagam and 
Chiranjeevi Master each held crucial, 
yet remarkably similar, ranks within 
the LTTE's intelligence hierarchy. 
While Chiranjeevi Master was tasked 
with overseeing operations in India, 
Vinayagam led strategic assaults in Sri 
Lanka's southern region. Both were 
considered second-tier leaders of the 
intelligence wing, directly beneath the

intelligence chief, Pottu Amman. Thayaparan, 
who held a key position in the internal 
intelligence division, currently resides in 
London under the name Sangeethan.
Still among the living are two other prominent 
LTTE intelligence operatives: Kalaiyan, the 
former head of the Trincomalee district 
intelligence wing, and Prabha, who led the 
intelligence wing in the Batticaloa district. 
Both surrendered to the military in the 
conflict's twilight.
Meanwhile, Vinayagam and Pukalaenthi 
Master were dispatched from Mullaitivu with 
a team of Black Tigers to carry out attacks 
in early 2009. Though their mission was 
unsuccessful, both managed to escape from Sri 
Lanka. Vinayagam lived a secret life in France 
until his death, while Pukalaenthi Master is 
now believed to be in the UK. Chiranjeevi 
Master, after purportedly negotiating with 
India's RAW, now resides in Chennai's 
Valasaravakkam, running a high-profile 
supermarket.
According to credible sources within the 
LTTE, in February 2009, a unit of Black Tigers 
under Vinayagam's command was transferred 
from the Mullaitivu-Kepapilavu FDL to the 
Vavuniya area on the orders of Pottu Amman. 
The squad infiltrated the Aasikulam forest in 
Vavuniya. Comprising 10-15 Black Tigers, 
this elite team was tasked with striking a 
long-surveilled target in the southern region, 
personally overseen by Vinayagam. Similarly, 
Pukalaenthi Master led a smaller contingent 
of Black Tigers, who were also dispatched to 
Vavuniya for an attack from Mullaitivu around 
the same time.

Former intelligence wing members of the 
LTTE revealed to the Jaffna Monitor that the 
team Vinayagam led was a formidable group 
of elite Black Tigers and seasoned fighters. 
Among them was Sempiyan, one of the 
LTTE's sharpest snipers. However, during an 
engagement with the Sri Lankan Army at the 
FDL, Sempiyan sustained injuries and had to 
withdraw.
Sempiyan is renowned within the LTTE for 
his sharpshooting skills; he was credited as 
the assassin in the high-profile killings of 
Sri Lanka's then Foreign Affairs Minister 
Lakshman Kadirgamar in Colombo and 
EPRLF leader Subathiran in Jaffna. The 
involvement of a sniper of Sempiyan's caliber 
in Vinayagam's team suggests that the planned 
attack was of significant magnitude, as 
indicated by our sources.
LTTE intelligence members told the Jaffna 
Monitor that while Sempiyan was involved 
in high-profile killings like that of Lakshman 
Kadirgamar, he was well-behaved and often 
a soft-spoken, down-to-earth man compared 
to others of his caliber in the LTTE. They 
mentioned that Sempiyan never showed off or 
spoke rudely to anyone. The fate of Sempiyan 
is not known to anyone; he is believed to have 
died in the last battle along with LTTE leader 
Prabhakaran.
A member of the LTTE's intelligence wing 
confided to the Jaffna Monitor that there 
were whispers among the ranks suggesting 
Vinayagam was plotting a massive attack on 
Bandaranaike International Airport, which 
had previously been targeted on July 24, 2001. 
He and the Black Tigers were allegedly sent to 
carry out this attack. Although Vinayagam had 
remained relatively inactive during periods of 
peace, these rumors strongly indicated that he 
was orchestrating a significant operation—if 
not on Bandaranaike International Airport, 
then somewhere equally important in the 
south.
The fate of the planned attack by Vinayagam 
remains in mystery, as it was never executed. 
Equally enigmatic is Vinayagam's escape, as 
he managed to flee to France via India. What 
happened to the Black Tigers dispatched with 
him to the military-controlled area remains 
unknown.
In the first week of April 2009, credible sources 
say that Pottu Amman himself orchestrated the 
escape of Vinayagam's wife and two children 
by sending them by boat from the Mathalan 
coast towards India. However, their escape 
was thwarted when the Sri Lankan Navy 
intercepted the boat. All passengers, including 
Vinayagam's family, were arrested and 
subsequently detained at the Boosa camp.
It is important to note that while Pottu 
Amman facilitated the escape of Vinayagam's 
family, around the same time, civilians 
attempting to flee the Mullivaikkal and New 
Vinayagam

Mathalan areas by boat were shot dead by the 
Tigers on orders from the LTTE leadership. 
During the same period, Balakumar, the 
former leader of EROS who later became a 
prominent member of the Tigers, was shot 
and wounded at sea by the Tigers in his own 
attempt to escape.
It is reported that following the demise of the 
LTTE leadership in Mullivaikkal, Vinayagam, 
and his team concealed themselves within 
the forest region of Vavuniya. One account 
suggests that he traveled from Mannar to India 
by boat and then to France.
Another account from former LTTE members 
suggests that Vinayagam traveled to Colombo 
and then flew to France from Katunayake 
Airport. They claim that after Vinayagam's 
wife was apprehended and detained by Sri 
Lankan intelligence services, he had no choice 
but to collaborate with them, who allegedly 
facilitated his relocation to France. These 
sources also argue that Vinayagam, who had 
over 10-15 Black Tigers under his command, 
did not initiate any attacks until the very end. 
The fate of these Black Tigers also remains 
unknown.
A senior leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Mr. V. Balakumaran, former leader of EROS, with his son in army 
custody after the brutal end of the Sri Lankan war in May 2009. The wound on Balakumar’s hand was caused by Sea Tiger gunfire 
when he attempted to escape LTTE territory in early 2009. He was caught, shot, and captured by the Sea Tigers, then sent back 
to shore with his family. On May 18th, 2009, he and his son surrendered to the army and vanished, while his wife and daughter 
managed to escape.
