angana Herath's remarkable spell of five 
wickets for three runs remains one of 
the most celebrated moments in World T20 
history. If your memory of this brilliance 
has faded, or if you want to revisit one of the 
greatest comebacks in any format, here's a 
recollection of Rangana Herath's herculean 
feat, especially as the World T20 fever grips the 
cricket world.
Sri Lanka's World title dreams were rapidly 
disintegrating in Chittagong. In a do-or-die 
battle against the Kiwis, the Lankans had 
managed a paltry 119—a score not even close 
to competitive. The Kiwis were off to a solid 
start, adding 18 runs for the loss of just one 
wicket. Only a miracle could keep Sri Lanka 
alive in the tournament.
Miracles aren't rare in Sri Lankan cricket. 
However, their likelihood becomes even more 
remote on the world stage, where survival 
hangs in the balance. Miracles are typically 
the work of superstars like Angelo Mathews, 
Sanath Jayasuriya, Lasith Malinga, and others. 
Described as super strong and supremely 
skilled, these are the adjectives that define 
those who perform miracles. Yet, on that 
day, it was none of them. A burly spinner, 
only slightly taller than the score his team 
posted that day, was Sri Lanka's last hope. 
Rangana Herath was never the superstar 
known for supreme feats. But that day was 
different. A comeback win is always special, 
but those orchestrated by bowlers are even 
more so. Melbourne, Durban, Galle—the list 
of memorable wins in our history is long. Yet, 
for some reason, nothing could evoke the same 
excitement and thrill as what would unfold in 
Chittagong that day. In a knockout game on 
the world stage, with their backs against the 
wall and no realistic chance, Herath was set to 
wield the magic wand that nobody knew he 
possessed in the shortest format of the game.
The Kiwi dynamite McCullum did what he 
does best: trying to intimidate the bowlers. 
In an attempt to do so, McCullum misread 
the length and turn, ending up stumped in 
Herath's first over. A T20 maestro was made 
to look like an amateur trying his first dance 
skit by a spinner who was far from the T20 
prototype. With Ross Taylor in the middle, 
the Kiwis were in safe hands. But Herath was 
in no mood to relent. A beautifully delivered 
arm ball, skidding off the glistening surface, 
trapped Taylor Plumb in front. The glimmer 
of hope was slowly but surely turning into 
rays of hope. Not only was he taking wickets, 
but Herath was also miserly with the runs. 
Neesham was the next victim of a perfect 
delivery from the off-spinner. Lured into the 
drive and beaten by the lack of pace, he was 
bowled through the famous gate. Herath was 
imparting his Midas touch on the proceedings. 
Suddenly, the Kiwis were left in a daze, not 
knowing what was transpiring in the middle. 
It was as if an alien power had engulfed 
an unsuspecting civilization. At 29-4, the 
game was not gone for the Kiwis, but it soon 
was to be. Luke Ronchi, the swashbuckling 
wicketkeeper-batsman, was squared up by a 
delivery that was angled in, pitched online, 
and straightened. As the umpire's finger went 
up, Sri Lankan hopes skyrocketed. Herath 
had caused havoc, sending the Kiwis into an 
avalanche, reducing them to 29-5. Despite

Williamson anchoring the innings and 
providing a fight, Herath's efforts were strong 
enough to outweigh the Kiwis. The wicket of 
Boult to polish off the Kiwi effort was a fitting 
end to a fabulous performance. As the ball 
landed in the safe palms of the ever-reliable 
Mahela at slip, Herath had orchestrated an 
unimaginable win, evoking feelings similar to 
the famous Kolkata triumph in 1996, though 
smaller in magnitude.
For a team to win a world tournament, 
moments must instill self-belief, signaling 
that something special is just around the 
corner. The Kotla chase in 1996 was one such 
moment that rejuvenated that year's campaign. 
Similarly, Herath's effort against all odds made 
one believe Sri Lanka was on the cusp of a 
world title. In 2014, almost all the Lankans 
had gone unsold in the IPL auction due to a 
mix of skill-related and administrative factors. 
This indicated that the team was competitive 
but not considered a top contender. In that 
context, it was fitting that a team, seen at best 
as outsiders to clinch the title, went on to reach 
the pinnacle powered by an individual who 
would not have been imagined as capable of 
delivering such a stellar effort in the shortest 
format of the game. While there are many 
celebrated bowling feats in the annals of our 
cricket, Herath's superlative 5-3 not only 
matches other renowned feats, but its impact 
transcends into a different stratosphere.

The Very Internal 
Investigation
Story

here is one commonality and one difference between this 
story and the famous novel by Franz Kafka. They are both 
about judicial inquiries: the title of his novel is ‘The Trial’ 
and the title of this story is “The Very Internal Investigation.” 
The difference is that although Kafka’s hero was not afforded 
the honor of having his last name spelled out, at least Kafka 
denoted it by the letter ‘K.” Our hero did not even deserve that. 
Now let us dive straight into our story.
This story begins abruptly with the discovery of a twenty-five 
year old mass grave from which eighty five human skulls and

heaps of human remains were excavated. 
The village of Maṇkumpāṉ lies four miles 
from the city of Jaffna. That is where the 
primary center for drinking water supply for 
the Jaffna archipelago is located. In March 
of last year, work began to lay underground 
pipes for supplying drinking water to 
Puṅgudutīvu. Excavating the first two miles of 
ground from Maṇkumpāṉ to lay pipes is not a 
difficult task. The soil in Maṇkumpāṉ is soft, 
moist, almost flowery, fine sand. Digging the 
soil is as easy as digging water. But beyond 
two miles, the soil turns into a hardened 
mixture of clay and conch shells. Digging 
and laying down pipes becomes arduous. 
The village where such hard ground begins is 
called Ūripulam.
When the employees of the Water Supply 
and Drainage Board used modern heavy 
equipment to excavate the soil in Ūripulam, 
they discovered the mass grave with eighty 
five human skulls and other human remains. 
The police from Kayts showed up right 
away and set up barricades around the mass 
grave. Neither the public nor the media were 
allowed near the site. When a Tamil Member 
of Parliament attempted to push past the 
police barricade, a junior police officer pushed 
him back, causing a melee. That evening, it 
was reported, the police baton-charged the 
people who had thronged there from far and 
wide after the news about the mass grave had 
spread.
The next morning, the Jaffna District Judge, 
the forensic medical expert, the Director of 
the Archaeological Survey, the Archaeological 
Excavation Officer, and various senior police 
officers converged on the mass grave which 
was under vigilant police guard. They began 
a detailed examination of the evidence. 
After eight months of analysis, this team 
could figure out the identities of neither the 
perpetrators nor the victims.
Associations for the Search of Missing 
Persons opined, “This mass grave is likely 
the handiwork of the military.” Some other 
organizations claimed, “The Tamil Tigers 
must have buried their victims here.” 
But neither side had any real evidence or 
eyewitnesses to back up their assertions. 
There were no gunshot wounds in any of the 
skulls, nor any other sign of injury. Not even 
a single spent bullet was found in the mass 
grave. Therefore, the entire investigation at 
the Jaffna District Court came to a standstill. 
The judge who was presiding over the 
investigation eventually retired from service.
At the beginning of this year, a person by the 
name Kaṉagasabai Thiyāgarām filed a petition 
at the Jaffna District Court. Thiyāgarām 
was from the village of Ūripulam where the 
mass grave was discovered. After the entire 
village was destroyed during the war, he 
was displaced to France. He had traveled 
to Sri Lanka on hearing the discovery of 
the mass grave in Ūripulam. His petition 
claimed that there was a well near the mass 
grave that had been filled with dirt, and that 
there may be more bodies buried inside the 
well. The petition asked for the well to be 
excavated. Many years ago, three brothers of 
Thiyāgarām’s had disappeared on the same 
day.
The petition came before the judges M. J. 
Nallaināthan and Eranga Kandewatta. They 
accepted the petition and ordered the well to 
be excavated. But it did not happen.
Thiyāgarām filed a second petition inquiring 
why the excavation was being delayed. When 
this petition came before the judges, the police 
explained that the well in question was built

by the Village Development Council whose 
permission was required before excavating the 
well, and that the police was having difficulty 
locating the Village Development Council 
administration. 
The judges did not accept this explanation 
by the police. They ruled to grant the police 
special permission for excavation, bypassing 
the need for express approval by the long-
defunct Village Development Council, 
and ordered that the work must begin 
immediately.
Seeing that the work still was not done, 
Thiyāgarām filed a third petition. The police 
informed the court, “Work was delayed 
because of the rainy season.” It was fixed that 
the work would begin on a specific date in 
April.
On that day, the work did not take place 
because the forensic medical expert had 
unexpectedly gone on leave. Thiyāgarām did 
not give up. He filed yet another petition. This 
time the judges were incensed. The very next 
day, they summoned the officials from the 
thirteen government departments involved 
and ordered that on May 15, the well must be 
excavated in the presence of the two judges.
Two days before the excavation was to 
begin, Thiyāgarām was arrested by the secret 
police at a Jaffna lodge. He had spoken about 
the excavation at the press association in 
Jaffna. The police found this to be a major 
offense. On the grounds that it was illegal 
for Thiyāgarām, a French citizen, to speak 
to the media about local political matters 
in Sri Lanka, they deported him to France. 
Hardly anyone noticed this development. The 
poet V. I. S. Jayapalen was the only one who 
commented on the matter on Facebook. “The 
Sri Lankan government arrested and deported 
me just as they did Thiyāgarām. When my 
country undergoes a new dawn, sunflowers

will blossom in the graveyards on our soil to 
welcome me back home,” he wrote with hope.
On the morning of the fifteenth of May, judges 
Nallaināthan and Kandewatta left Jaffna in 
the same vehicle and headed to Ūripulam via 
the Paṇṇai bridge. Both were convinced that 
they were carrying out their duties as judges 
correctly and justly. Kandewatta grasped 
Nallaināthan’s hand and gently squeezed it. It 
was a symbolic gesture meant to convey the 
message, ‘We will stand on the side of justice 
without fearing anyone. Be brave!’
Nallaināthan was the quintessential Point 
Pedro Tamil. Kandewatta was a descendant 
of Uyana Puran Appu, who rebelled 
against the British colonial masters in the 
nineteenth century. Both of them had a close, 
long-standing friendship. They attended 
Colombo Law College together and served 
together as lawyers at a court in Colombo. 
They were appointed judges on the same 
day. Kandewatta’s Tamil was as perfect as 
Nallaināthan’s flawless Sinhala. Kandewatta 
arrived in Jaffna in the same month as when 
Nallaināthan was transferred to Jaffna.
The judges’ vehicle left the Paṇṇai bridge 
and drove through Maṇkumpāṉ to reach 
Ūripulam. Nallaināthan was returning to 
Ūripulam after a gap of about forty years. 
On his previous visits, Ūripulam was a 
picturesque seaside village that could 
have been taken out of a painting. Now 
it was overgrown with young palm trees 
and shrubbery. The only evidence of prior 
human habitation was the small, dilapidated, 
low-walled Vairavar temple. Someone 
from Maṇkumpāṉ used to show up every 
day to light an oil lamp at the temple. But 
the discovery of the mass grave, and the 
subsequent round-the-clock patrolling by the 
police and the military had ensured that there 
was no longer anyone coming by every day to 
light a lamp at the temple.
Nallaināthan began recounting to Kandewatta 
his recollections of earlier visits to Ūripulam. 
When he was studying in Jaffna, Nallaināthan 
often went to the white beach with friends to 
bathe in the sea. One has to go past Ūripulam 
to get to the white beach. Ūripulam was a 
tiny, lone village surrounded by thick palmyra 
woods on three sides and the sea on the south 
side. The palmyra toddy from Ūripulam was 
considered superior even to the renowned 
Kūvil toddy. Whenever they visited the white 
beach, Nallaināthan and his friends always 
stopped by at Ūripulam for some toddy. When 
he was younger, Nallaināthan was anemic. So, 
he had the habit of consuming pure toddy in 
small amounts to strengthen his body.
Nallaināthan climbed down from the vehicle 
and looked up at the tall palmyra trees. They 
were full of dried leaves and rotten petioles. 
There was no sign of humans as far as the eye 
could see. It was an abandoned piece of land, 
after the entire village was shattered and its 
inhabitants were displaced.
Having learnt from the chaos that resulted 
when the mass grave was excavated the 
previous year, the police had arranged for 
heightened security. Not even a dog could 
wander in without their knowledge. Starting 
from two days prior to the planned excavation 
date, the police had completely barred the 
public or media from entering Ūripulam.
A tent had been set up next to the well with 
chairs and desks for the judges and other 
functionaries. Once the judges gave the order, 
the workers quickly started their machinery 
and got on with the excavation.
It was a parapet well with a surrounding

wall. The experts who accompanied the 
judges surmised that there had been a thick 
hexagonal surrounding wall standing at the 
height of three feet from ground level. The 
wall had been demolished and pushed inside 
the well which had then been filled to the 
surface level with clay and conch soil. The 
machinery quickly removed the soil.
As Nallaināthan was cleaning his eyeglasses, 
Kandewatta leaned over to ask softly, “Do 
you think we will find something inside?” 
Nallaināthan pondered this for a while and 
said, “Looking at the state of this village, I 
think the entire village is inside this well.”
Kandewatta extended his hand to grab 
Nallaināthan’s and squeezed it lightly. His 
face had darkened. He murmured to himself, 
“Is there yet another unsolvable case awaiting 
us inside this well?”
The experts who had already estimated 
that the well was not deep, turned out to be 
correct. Within a depth of twenty feet, gaps 
began to be visible. Huge chunks of the 
surrounding wall had piled on top of one 
another. When the machinery lifted the wall 
chunks out, the water level became visible. 
There were moss and ferns growing along the 
inner walls of the well. Some aquatic plants 
had grown amidst these. When the machinery 
lifted a huge slab of concrete, something odd 
inside the well became visible.
Nallaināthan and Kandewatta immediately 
ordered the excavation to be halted. Two 
thick ropes were lowered into the well and 
two strong men climbed down the well. Once 
inside, they yelled out from the depths of the 
well with a mixture of fear and surprise:

“There is a man alive here.”
It is not important for this little story to dwell 
in detail on how the judges felt on hearing 
this, or how the forensic experts reacted, 
or what the Director of the Archaeological 
Survey guessed, or the consternation that 
spread among the police. Instead, let us end 
the first half of this story here, and proceed to 
the second half.

The horizon was turning red, and darkness 
was beginning to engulf Ūripulam as they 
lowered a long wide plank on four strong 
ropes and lifted the man out of the ruined 
well. The man was laid down on a rubber 
sheet inside the judges’ tent. The doctors 
who examined the man reported back to the 
judges in astonishment that he appeared to 
be in reasonable health. Nallaināthan gently 
squeezed Kandewatta’s hand. Then, he 
summoned a policeman and asked him to go 
light a lamp at the Vairavar temple visible in 
the distance. He then peered in silence into the 
darkness towards the sea. Once he spotted the 
tiny flame flickering into life, he let out a huge 
sigh.
Outside the tent, police jostled one another 
forming a protective ring around the tent. 
Doctors and archeologists sat on the chairs 
outside the tent and started smoking. The two 
judges sat on their chairs, illuminated by the 
soft glow of the lone lamp lit inside the tent.
The man who was discovered alive sat up 
slowly. The doctors had wrapped his naked 
body up in a new white blanket. He was 
taking deep breaths noisily. His two eyes set 
in his black face covered in a thicket of hair, 
rolled around like duck eggs in the low light.
Having explained in detail who they were and 
what was going on, the judges slowly began 
their judicial investigation.
“First of all, what is your name?”
“I don’t know, aiyā.” 
“Don’t you have a name?”
“How can I be without a name? But since 
no one has called me by my name for a long 
time, I have forgotten it. No matter how hard 
I rack my brains, I can’t seem to be able to 
recall my name.”
“What about your parents?”
“My mother’s name is Aṉṉam. My father’s 
name is Chellaiyā. I have four sisters and five 
brothers. Since I have been thinking of them 
constantly, I have not forgotten any of their 
names.”
“How long have you been in this well?”
“I don’t know, aiyā.” 
“Do you remember the date when you entered 
this well?”
“Very clearly. Saturday, the 22nd of August in 
1990 was my twenty-fourth birthday. Already 
the previous evening, my younger sister had 
given me the hand-made birthday card she 
made from white cardboard. My bad luck 
started when I went to light the lamp at the 
Vairavar temple that night, Friday night, that 
is. As long as I was outside, I was the one who 
lit the lamp at the temple every evening. My 
family has done this for generations. My great 
grandfather Murukēsu had built the temple.”
“You remember all this.. But cannot 
remember your own name?”

“Aiyā, even as I answer your questions, I keep 
trying to remember my name.”
The judges were served tea. When the man 
was served tea, he pouted his lips to blow 
on the tea noisily as he drank it. The judges 
resumed the inquiry.
“Tell us in detail about yourself and how you 
came to be inside this well. But before that, 
finish drinking your tea.
The man set the cup with the remaining tea 
down on the sand and started telling his story. 
His was not a particularly interesting story. It 
was a story that had been told repeatedly. But 
as evidence, the story is very important to the 
judges as well to us.
“When I was young, I remember reading a 
story about a fly that had forgotten its name. 
My story seems to be similar. I hardly left this 
village. The prevailing situation in the country 
was not amenable to venturing outside either. 
I went to school until grade ten. I tried taking 
the grade ten examination twice but failed 
in all subjects. My sisters scolded me as a 
complete idiot, and my father called me a 
lazy bum. My mother said, “he is a type.” I 
had no interest in working or earning money. 
But from childhood, I was pious and had a 
great interest in social service. This may be 
hereditary. My grandfather Kadirkāmu was 
also said to have been very keen on public 
service. It was said that he was responsible 
for laying down the gravel road towards the 
white beach. Before that, there were no roads 
in Ūripulam.
I was at the forefront of establishing the 
‘Tiruvaḷḷuvar Library.’ It may be just a 
thatched hut, and it may be that it received 
just one newspaper every day, but it was a 
center where the youth gathered to socialize. 
After fighting with the Indian Peace Keeping 
Force broke out, no food was delivered to the 
Jaffna archipelago for three months. I led the 
youth of the village in making porridge for the 
entire village every morning. We also led all 
sorts of other community activities like school 
sports meets, the Vairavar temple festival, and

voluntary shramadāna activities.
After the fighting had resumed, a corpse 
would wash ashore at the Ūripulam seashore 
at least once a week. Having been in the 
brackish seawater for many days, these 
corpses would be pale and swollen. Some 
would have gunshot wounds. They would lie 
on the seashore like huge balloons, their flesh 
peeling off at the touch. No one would know 
if a corpse belonged to a Tamil, a Sinhalese, 
or an Indian. No one would be ready to 
bury the bodies. It was we, the youth of the 
‘Tiruvaḷḷuvar Library,’ who would dig graves 
on the shore to bury the bodies.
Two youths from the village went to join a 
militant group in 1984. One day during the 
rainy season, their bodies were found in this 
well. No one knew if they were suicides or 
murders. Thereafter, no one from our village 
joined militant groups. The groups did not 
frequent the village often either.
If you asked about the military, then until 
August 1990, they did not set foot in 
Ūripulam. This was just a tiny village of a 
hundred huts. On the twenty-first of August, 
the military landed in the entire archipelago. 
News quickly spread that they were advancing 
without meeting any resistance. There was 
no escape in any direction. People fled their 
homes to seek refuge in public buildings. All 
of Ūripulam deserted the village to flee to the 
white beach. We gathered at the Guru Bawa 
mosque awaiting the arrival of the military. 
But we were confident that the military would 
not attack a mosque. The elders responsible 
for the mosque felt the same. By midday, 
there was no sign of the military. We had 
no way to know where the military was. 
The mosque elders arranged for lunch to be 
prepared in big vessels. It was there that my 
younger sister drew the birthday card for me. 
Things had normalized to a great extent by 
sundown that it was natural to think about 
birthday greetings. People thought they could 
spend the night at the mosque and return 
home in the morning.
The sun set and the reddish twilight filled 
the horizon. They started adhan, the call for 
the sunset prayer, the maghrib. When I heard 
that, I started to worry that my Vairavar was 
without a lamp that day. To leave the guard 
deity of Ūripulam without light on a day, a 
Friday at that, could bring ill fortune to the 
entire village. Once that thought entered my 
head, I left the mosque quietly, without telling 
anyone, and started to make my way along the 
shore towards Ūripulam.
The seashore was covered with thickets of 
screw pines and wild date palms. So, I walked 
carefully through them, concealing myself in 
the overgrowth, and checking from time to 
time if I could spot any sign of the military. 
By the time I reached Ūripulam, it was 
completely dark. I went into my home to pick 
up the bottle of oil and a box of matches and 
walked towards the Vairavar temple. Nothing 
stirred along the way.
I waded into the sea to wash my hands and 
feet and lit the lamp in front of Vairavar’s 
trident. The temple had a short wall, a small 
pedestal, and a single trident. It looked as 
if the entire village was lit up by the tiny, 
single flame. A great sense of calm descended 
into my heart. It was then that I noticed the 
military. They emerged from the darkness 
silently and stood in the lamp light. My hands 
were tied behind my back. I was marched to 
this well and was made to sit on the ground. 
I was not beaten or otherwise harmed. From 
here, I could see the flame in the temple.
I could hear the rustle of human figures

moving about around me. I peered into the 
darkness to get a sense of what was going 
on. It seemed like the army was all over the 
landscape. A soldier came to me to ask if I 
wanted water. I nodded. He drew water from 
this very well and poured it on me. I drank 
like a fish. He asked me to lie down. Because 
my hands were tied behind my back, I could 
not lie on my stomach or back. So, I lay on 
my side and thought about the possibility of 
escape. There was no chance. The sounds 
of people walking about and conversing in 
Sinhala came from all directions. The distant 
sounds of vehicles gradually became louder. I 
closed my eyes. As soon as I closed my eyes, 
it felt like my body was glowing. I imagined 
that the spark I lit for Vairavar was glowing in 
my heart. I spent the night drawing comfort 
from that confidence.
Only when it was dawn could I see that 
Ūripulam was filled with the military 
overnight. I sat up slowly and looked around. 
There were many people lying down, or 
sitting up, with hands tied behind their backs. 
Strangely, the knowledge that I was not the 
only one to be detained by the military gave 
me a sort of comfort.
Although armed soldiers stood guard around 
us, they did not trouble us in any way. If one 
were to find fault, we could say that they 
did not give us food or water the entire day. 
Throughout the day, they brought in captives 
from all over the area, from Maṇdaitīvu, 
from Maṇkumpāṉ, from Allaipiddi, and from 
Vēlaṇai. They were marched here in small 
groups, their hands tied behind their backs. At 
high noon, my two brothers and some others 
were brought. The elders from the mosque 
were with them.
We spoke amongst ourselves in low voices. 
The military did not stop us from speaking.

Some said they would interrogate us and let 
us leave. Some others said they would load 
all of us up on a ship and send us off to the 
dreaded Boosa detention camp.
Soon they made us sit down in nine rows 
because a senior military official was about to 
come to see us. We were eighty-six in total. 
The official came by and looked at us without 
any sign of emotion on his face. It barely took 
a minute. He then walked along the seashore.
A little later, I saw the soldiers drive two big 
machines towards us. They started digging 
a huge hole a short distance from us in 
the clay and conch soil. Dust rose above 
the palmyra treetops. The noise from the 
machines deafened us. The smoke and the 
smell of burning diesel nauseated us. We all 
understood what was about to happen.
The sun was sinking rapidly into the horizon. 
Judging from the dusk, it was probably 
around six in the evening. A large, elaborate 
grave had taken shape before us. The military 
made us line up beside it. They then asked 
us to climb down into the grave. There was 
no protest or signs of resistance. I listened 
intently to see if there were any sounds of 
crying. I could only hear the roar of the sea. 
The jagged line was descending into the 
grave. I saw my brothers climb down, looking 
over their shoulders at me. The mosque 
elder who was behind me in the line started 
chanting in a melodic voice. It was certainly 
the voice for the final prayer. I listened to the 
voice. It seemed like it was getting louder. My 
feet stepped out of the line and stopped. The 
elder walked past me; his voice continued to 
chant.
A soldier walked rapidly to where I had 
stepped out from the line. His eyes peered 
sharply at mine. He was tall, with curly 
hair, reminding me of my brother. As he 
approached me, I said:
“Let me go light the lamp for Vairavar first..”
It was clear to me that he did not understand 
what I said. I started walking towards the 
Vairavar temple. He did not stop me. I walked 
slowly until I reached this well. Before I could 
light the lamp, I needed to wash my hands and 
feet. Some soldiers were sitting on the wall 
surrounding the well. I told them:
“Please untie my hands for a while. I will 
light the lamp for Vairavar..”
One soldier grabbed my head, and another 
grabbed my feet. They lifted me off the 
ground and dropped me into the well. I 
stumbled to my feet. The water came only up 
to my knees. I waded over to a dark corner of 
the well and listened for gunshots. There was 
no sound of any explosion. Instead, all I heard 
was the giant machinery roaring back and 
forth. Eventually the roar approached closer. 
The earth started to tremble. The surrounding 
wall of the well was broken, and giant pieces 
of the wall started to fall into the well.”
Nallaināthan gently squeezed Kandewatta’s 
hand twice. The man draped in the white 
blanket resumed drinking the tea remaining in 
his cup.
Nallaināthan and Kandewatta deliberated the 
matter in hushed tones for nearly an hour. 
Then they went outside the tent to consult 
the forensic medical expert and the police 
officers. When they returned to the tent, they 
noticed that the man’s duck-egg eyes were 
shining brighter than before. “This man’s soul 
lies in his eyes,” said Kandewatta. The judges 
took their seats.

“Have you been able to remember your 
name?”
“Not yet, aiyā.”
“It is a wonder that you stayed alive for such a 
long time inside a well that was closed off.”
“It is no wonder. I survived there just like the 
water that stayed on the ground, or the plants, 
and frogs, and creepy crawlies that continue 
to live there.”
The judges were silent for a while and began 
to speak again:
“The war in this country ended seven years 
ago. Many thousands were killed throughout 
the war. Many mass graves have been 
discovered. There were atrocities committed 
by all sides. As you said yourself, human 
remains have been discovered without any 
hint as to whether they belonged to Tamils 
or Sinhalese or Indians. Peace has now come 
to our land after having had to get past all of 
these hurdles. This is the season for forgetting 
old hatreds.”
The other judge continued:
“Other countries are always pressing us to 
hold international investigations into these 
mass graves. But we have been insisting that 
internal investigations would suffice. We have 
already begun these internal investigations. 
It is as part of such an investigation that we 
excavated this well and discovered you. We 
completely accept the testimony you provided 
before us.
But of what use is your testimony for this 
land and its people? Your testimony is like 
ripping open and examining a wound that has 
been healing. If your testimony keeps digging 
into these wounds, how will they heal? Your 
testimony will only fuel hatred, not peace.”
The judge concluded firmly:
“We will not permit any attempt that can 
hinder reconciliation. We are not prepared to 
lose this peace for any reason whatsoever. You 
said you have a social conscience and that you 
have always been interested in serving the 
people. Therefore, we assume that you are a 
socially responsible good citizen. Preserving 
peace is your duty!”
The judges stood up to signal that the judicial 
investigation had concluded.
The man was lowered into the well as 
carefully as he was lifted out earlier. The 
well was closed once again. Kaṉagasabai 
Thiyāgarām’s petition was dismissed by the 
judges.
Both judges left exhausted and with heavy 
hearts. When the vehicle carrying the two 
of them started to leave, Nallaināthan asked 
the vehicle to be stopped for a minute. He 
beckoned a police officer offer to approach 
him, and gave him an order:
“The oil lamp for Ūripulam Vaiyravar must be 
lit every day without fail.”
Kandewatta took hold of Nallaināthan’s hand 
and squeezed it lightly.
