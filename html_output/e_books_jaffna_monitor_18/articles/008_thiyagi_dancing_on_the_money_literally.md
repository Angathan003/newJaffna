ontroversy continues to surround 
Thiyakenthiran Vamadeva, commonly 
known as "Thiyagi," the owner of TCT 
Supermarket in Nallur and the chairman of 
Thiyagi Charitable Trust Jaffna. 
Ironically, the name "Thiyagi," meaning 
sacrificer, was self-bestowed, reflecting his self-
aggrandizing character. His recent public aid 
distribution events, ostensibly aimed at helping 
the impoverished, have drawn widespread 
criticism for their degrading nature. Reports 
indicate that beneficiaries are often made to 
wait for extended periods under the scorching 
sun, subjecting them to unnecessary hardship 
and indignity.  
Adding to the controversy, several videos have 
surfaced showing Thiyagi dancing to MGR 
songs. In these videos, he is seen forcefully 
inviting some of the girls who came to receive 
aid and dancing with them against their will.

These actions have not only 
raised concerns about respect 
for the recipients but have 
also intensified scrutiny over 
Vamadeva's sources of wealth, 
behavior, and mental stability 
within the local community.  
Thiyakenthiran Vamadeva, 
known as "Thiyagi," announced 
that he would be distributing 
donations and aid on June 7th 
to celebrate his daughter's 40th 
birthday. This announcement 
led to thousands of people 
gathering on Navalar Road, 
where his supermarket is 
located, resulting in a massive 
traffic jam. The police were 
initially called to regulate 
traffic and manage the crowd, 
but their efforts proved 
insufficient, necessitating the 
intervention of the army to 
control the situation. Many 
waiting in the long queue 
under the scorching sun for 
a few thousand rupees of 
donations were disabled or 
physically unwell.
In a disturbing incident 
captured on video, Thiyagi was 
seen snatching a disabled boy 
from his mother's arms and 
holding him while dancing 
to an old MGR song. The 
discomfort and physical pain 
of the child was clearly visible, 
exacerbating public outrage. 
This act has been widely 
condemned as insensitive 
and exploitative, highlighting 
Thiyagi's blatant disregard for the dignity and well-being 
of vulnerable individuals.
During his aid distribution event, Thiyakenthiran 
Vamadeva, known as "Thiyagi," invited numerous 
YouTubers to give publicity to the ceremony. In an 
interview with a female YouTuber, Thiyagi claimed he 
does not respect money. To emphasize his point, he 
took a bundle of 5000 rupee notes from his shirt pocket, 
amounting to lakhs of rupees, and threw it on the ground, 
stepping on it. This act, particularly the disrespect shown 
towards money—a symbol of prosperity and the goddess 
Lakshmi in local culture—has infuriated many in Jaffna, 
who view it as an affront to their values and struggles. 
Many locals have asked, "Can one do nonsense just 
because they have money?"

The incident sparked a backlash 
on social media, with even 
those who once benefited from 
his aid questioning the dignity 
of receiving money in such a 
degrading manner. Thiyagi 
further exacerbated the situation 
by declaring that he fears no 
one, including the President of 
Sri Lanka. He stated that if the 
President wished to meet him, 
he should come to him. While 
some locals interpreted this as a 
symbol of self-respect, Thiyagi's 
subsequent public request for 
endorsement of his aspiration 
to become the Governor of 
the Northern Province fueled 
widespread ridicule.
Adding to the controversy are 
allegations regarding the origins 
of Thiyagi's wealth. Credible 
sources claim that the money 
flaunted by Thiyagi does not 
originate from his supermarket 
business, as he claimed, but 
rather from questionable 
investments in Europe, including 
Switzerland. It is alleged that 
these funds are transferred to Sri 
Lanka through various channels.
In social media posts, many 
have started highlighting how 
Thiyagi seems more focused on 
self-promotion than on genuinely 
helping the poor. One user 
recounted an incident where 
they approached Thiyagi to help 
a person needing an immediate 
kidney transplant. Instead of 
providing immediate assistance, Thiyagi told them to 
bring the patient to his New Year event, where he would 
distribute money, and asked them to stand in line, even 
though the patient could barely stand. The Facebook 
user angrily questioned Thiyagi's motives, suggesting 
he wanted to use the patient's plight to showcase his 
generosity to the world rather than offering sincere help.
People have also pointed out that if Thiyagi's intentions 
are indeed to help others without any expectations, there 
are many ways to do so without subjecting the poor 
to indignity. Rather than calling them en masse and 
throwing money, which they likened to throwing food 
to stray dogs, they argue that he should adopt a more 
respectful approach. If Thiyagi genuinely wants to help, 
he should avoid subjecting the poor to the hardship of 
standing in line under the scorching sun, particularly 
those who are differently-abled, visually impaired, and 
mothers with infants. Instead, he could collaborate with 
the Grama Niladhari office and Pradesha Saba office to 
identify those in need and assist them directly.
While it is true that Thiyagi is one of the rare individuals 
who provide aid to the poor in Jaffna and has donated 
crores worth of aid, locals pointed out that he seems 
more interested in showcasing himself as a 'Vallal' 
(philanthropist) in the style of MGR than in truly helping 
the poor. They highlighted that this is where the problem 
lies entirely.

ndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has 
assumed office for a third consecutive term, 
a rare achievement in independent India, 
previously accomplished only by the country's 
first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. 
However, Modi's political muscles aren't as 
flexed as they were in 2014 and 2019.
Back in 2014, the BJP secured 282 seats, and 
the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) 
coalition, a merry band of center-right and 
right-wing political parties led by the BJP, won 
a total of 336 seats. In 2019, they leveled up, 
with the BJP winning 303 seats and the NDA 
securing 353 seats.
This time, though, it's a bit more like a 
game of political Twister, with fewer solid 
footings and more balancing acts. In the 2024 
elections, the BJP secured only 240 seats, and 
the NDA coalition achieved a slim majority 
with 293 seats. Despite this decline, Modi's 
continuation marks a significant milestone in 
Indian politics, becoming India's second Prime 
Minister to serve three consecutive terms.

ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, complete 
with all the pomp and circumstance. This new 
cabinet, a lively mix of seasoned veterans and 
fresh faces, is geared up to tackle the challenges 
ahead and drive India toward progress.
However, nearly 20 of them hail from political 
families, proving that dynastic politics is not 
just a Congress tradition. Congress leader 
Rahul Gandhi couldn't resist taking a jab at the 
Modi government, dubbing the NDA ministry 
a "Parivar Mandal" (family club), adding a 
splash of humor to the political theater.
PM Modi's cabinet features prominent BJP 
leaders such as Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, 
Nitin Gadkari, and JP Nadda. Notably, with JP 
Nadda, the current BJP president, returning 
to the cabinet, it signals that the party might 
soon appoint a new president, in line with 
its "one man, one post" policy. The cabinet 
also includes Nirmala Sitharaman and S. 
Jaishankar—two Tamils—who continue to 
handle the crucial ministries of Finance and 
External Affairs, respectively, just as they 
did in the previous Modi regime. The irony, 
however, is that both rarely identify themselves 
as Tamils. Tamil Nadu might be scratching its 
head, wondering, "Are they really one of us?"
Additionally, Tamil Nadu has representation 
in the form of L. Murugan, the Dalit face of 
the Tamil Nadu BJP. Despite losing his seat 
in Nilgiris to DMK heavyweight A. Raja, 
Murugan was sworn in as Minister of State in 
the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting 
of India. He previously served as MOS in the 
last Modi administration as well.
The Council of Ministers includes 30 Cabinet 
Ministers, five Ministers of State with 
Independent Charge, and 36 Ministers of 
State. Notably, seven former chief ministers 
have been sworn into the new council, 
including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 
who previously served as the Chief Minister 
of Gujarat. The other former C.M.s are Shivraj 
Singh Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh), Rajnath 
Singh (Uttar Pradesh), Manohar Lal Khattar 
(Haryana), Sarbananda Sonowal (Assam), 
H.D. Kumaraswamy (Karnataka), and Jitan 
Ram Manjhi (Bihar). Additionally, actor-

turned-politician Suresh Gopi, the BJP's 
first Lok Sabha MP from Kerala, has been 
appointed Minister of State for Tourism.
Significant representation has been given 
to key states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, 
with Bihar securing four cabinet berths and 
Uttar Pradesh receiving nine ministerial 
positions. The cabinet also reflects a diverse 
composition, with 42 ministers hailing from 
the Other Backward Class (OBC), Scheduled 
Caste (S.C.), and Scheduled Tribe (S.T.) 
communities. However, it is notable that 
there is no Muslim representation in the new 
ministry, with not a single Muslim included 
among the 71 ministers.
"This team of ministers is a great blend of 
youth and experience; we will leave no stone 
unturned in improving people's lives. I look 
forward to serving 140 crore Indians and 
working with the Council of Ministers to take 
India to new heights of progress," PM Modi 
said in a post on X after the ceremony.
Shifting Political Landscape
With all of India's 640 million votes counted 
after a six-week-long election, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP), along with its National 
Democratic Alliance (NDA), has secured a 
majority, albeit with a notable reduction in 
their seat tally compared to the 2019 elections.

In contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance, 
spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi's Indian 
National Congress (INC), made remarkable 
gains, securing 232 seats. The Congress party 
itself saw a significant increase, winning 99 
seats compared to just 52 in 2019.
Key States and Shifting Loyalties
Uttar Pradesh (UP), India's most populous 
state, has always been a crucial battleground. 
In 2019, the NDA won 64 of UP's 80 seats, 
with the BJP taking 62. However, in 2024, the 
INDIA alliance made significant inroads. The 
Samajwadi Party (S.P.) won 37 seats, and the 
Congress took six, totaling 43 seats for the 
opposition. The BJP managed to win only 33 
seats, with its allies securing three more.
A stunning loss for the BJP occurred in the 
Faizabad constituency, home to the Ram 
temple in Ayodhya, a cornerstone of the 
BJP's Hindutva campaign. Despite Modi 
consecrating the temple in January, the BJP 
lost this symbolic seat. Post-election videos 
reveal widespread public resentment as the 
BJP-ruled state government in Uttar Pradesh 
demolished hundreds of houses and shops 
to create a grand pathway to the temple. This 
heavy-handed approach sparked a significant 
backlash against the ruling government 
at both the state and central levels. When 
we contacted a few Delhi BJP leaders, they 
candidly admitted that, with the consecration 
of the Ram temple, every BJP leader in UP 
thought they were going to have a cakewalk in 
the election. However, the shrewd Samajwadi 
Party leader Akhilesh Yadav had other plans.
While Ayodhya voters support the Ram 
temple, they prioritized their basic needs 
when faced with the choice between Ram, 
Food, and shelter. As a saying in the Hindi 
heartlands goes: "Pehle bhojan, phir aashray, 
aur phir mandir." ("Food first, shelter second, 
and temple third.") Clearly, the voters took this 
seriously.
In Maharashtra, another key state, the BJP 
and its allies suffered significant losses. The 
INDIA alliance, which includes the Congress 
and splinter groups of Shiv Sena and the 
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), won 30 of 
the state's 48 seats, with the Congress alone 
winning 13. The BJP secured only nine seats.
Historical Context and Political 
Evolution
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP and 
its right-wing predecessors have risen from 
political obscurity to dominate India's 
parliament. The BJP first came to power with a 
coalition government for just 13 days in 1996, 
subsequently ruling from 1998 to 2004. After 
a surprise loss to a Congress-led coalition in 
2004, the Congress governed until 2014 under 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. However, 
from 2014 onward, it has been Modi's era, with 
him enjoying immense public trust and being 
seen as an unbeatable leader.
However, this election has shown a shift, as the 
BJP did not secure a single-party majority and 
now relies heavily on its allies. Despite this, in 
Indian politics, anything can happen. The BJP 
could still emerge as the single largest party 
by... let's just say, "convincing" a few M.P.s from 
other parties to switch sides or by sending 
a few friendly visits from the CBI and other 
investigating agencies to targeted M.P.s—a 
tactic they seem to have perfected with a wink 
and a nudge.
