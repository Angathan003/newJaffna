Celebrating Literary Excellence 
and Cultural Heritage: A Spotlight 
on V.V. Ganeshananthan
Dear Readers,
We are exhilarated to unveil the latest edition of 
the Jaffna Monitor, an eloquent testament to the 
vivacious voices and multifarious perspectives that 
sculpt our collective narrative.
This edition distinguishes itself with an exclusive 
interview featuring the illustrious V.V. "Sugi" 
Ganeshananthan, an acclaimed American fiction 
writer, essayist, and journalist of Sri Lankan Tamil 
lineage. We are euphoric to extol her recent triumph, 
having secured the prestigious 2024 Carol Shields 
Prize for Fiction. Notably, she clinched the Women's 
Prize for Fiction on June 13th—the very day this 
editorial is penned. Heartfelt felicitations to her!
Ganeshananthan, whose roots trace back to Jaffna, 
brings a unique blend of cultural richness and literary 
prowess to the global stage. Her parents moved to 
the USA, yet she has retained a deep connection 
to her heritage, which resonates powerfully in her 
works. It is our great privilege to share her insights, 
experiences, and the remarkable journey that has led 
her to such prestigious recognition.
This issue also features an intriguing piece by the 
renowned Sri Lankan Tamil writer and journalist 
Saravanan Komathi Nadarasa. His exploration of 
an under-examined topic promises to captivate and 
enlighten our readers, offering a fresh, thought-
provoking, and engaging perspective.
However, due to unavoidable reasons, we regret 
to inform you that Part 3 of our exclusive series, 
"Humanitarian Diaries," will be postponed to our 
next issue. We understand the anticipation and 
appreciate your patience as we 
strive to bring you this compelling 
testimony.
Additionally, we are delighted to 
present a masterful translation of 
celebrated writer Shobasakthi's 
short story, kpf cs;sf tprhuiz 
(The Very Internal Investigation). 
Skillfully translated by 
Eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ, this story delves 
into the intricacies of human nature 
and societal dynamics, offering a 
profound and immersive reading 
experience.
Thank you for your continued 
support and engagement with the 
Jaffna Monitor.
Warm regards,
