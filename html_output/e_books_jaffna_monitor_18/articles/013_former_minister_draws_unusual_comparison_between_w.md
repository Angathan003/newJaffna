n an unexpectedly colorful turn during 
a recent parliamentary debate, former 
Minister of Wildlife Protection, Wimalaweera 
Dissanayake, dropped a bombshell comparison 
that left attendees both bemused and 
concerned. He likened the disruptive antics of 
wild elephants in Sri Lanka to the infamous 
guerrilla tactics of the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). "Just like the LTTE, 
these elephants are making it impossible for 
us to get a good night's sleep!" he exclaimed, 
highlighting the sleepless nights suffered by 
residents in elephant-frequented areas.
Dissanayake elaborated on the elephantine 
problem, saying, "You can’t even step outside 
for a midnight snack without wondering 
if an elephant is lurking in the bushes!" 
This comparison, while stark, humorously 
underscored the constant vigilance required by 
villagers living in these conflict zones.

injunctions seem to be mysteriously 
spared by the elephants, almost as if 
the animals had a legal understanding 
themselves. "Maybe these elephants are 
more law-abiding than we thought!" 
Dissanayake quipped, suggesting a 
need for a revision of current wildlife 
management strategies.
Urgent Calls Amidst Light-
Hearted Analogies
Despite the light-hearted analogy, 
Dissanayake’s message carried a serious 
undertone about the need for effective 
and fair solutions to mitigate human-
elephant conflicts. "We need action that's 
as swift as an elephant charge but as wise 
as an elephant's memory," he stated, 
emphasizing the urgency of finding 
a balance that protects both the rural 
communities and the majestic wildlife 
that strays too close.
Owing to unforeseen circumstances, Part 3 of this 
riveting testimony, marking the 15th anniversary 
of Sri Lanka's brutal war conclusion, will be fea-
tured in our subsequent issue. Stay tuned for this 
enthralling continuation.
