Early Days and Initial Activism
Ponnamman, a senior member of the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was a dear friend of mine from our 
days at Jaffna Hindu College. Our friendship, which initially 
began with a confrontation at the college, grew stronger 
over time. In 1973, along with Ponnamman, Chera, Thave, 
and a few others, we formed a group called the "Try Science 
Association" with ambitious plans to develop anything that 
could be useful for liberation efforts. One of our significant 
1988, Madras: LTTE representatives in talks 
with the Muslim United Liberation Front 
(MULF). From left to right: Dinesh Master, 
Kiddu, Anton Master, and Raheem.

prototype biplane. 
We managed to 
construct the basic 
framework and 
skeleton, including 
a propeller. 
Unfortunately, 
the project was 
eventually halted 
due to financial 
constraints, and the 
group disbanded as 
members went on 
to pursue university 
education or moved 
abroad.
