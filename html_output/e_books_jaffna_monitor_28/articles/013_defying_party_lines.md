Defying Party Lines:
In a surprising twist of political allegiance, Angajan 
Ramanathan, a prominent Member of Parliament for 
the Jaffna District from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, 
has reportedly made an unexpected decision to sup-
port President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This move 
comes as a surprise, particularly as it contradicts the 
official stance of his party.
On a significant four-day tour last Thursday, Presi-
dent Ranil Wickremesinghe marked his presence in 
Jaffna, engaging in a series of meetings and events 
across the district. In a display of unanticipated ca-
maraderie, MP Angajan Ramanathan was observed 
participating in every meeting attended by President 
Wickremesinghe. Political pundits are abuzz, inter-
preting Ramanathan's consistent presence at these 
events as a tacit endorsement of the President.
Sources further reveal that Angajan Ramanathan 
didnâ€™t just attend these meetings; he was a conspicu-
ous presence, often taking a prominent position on 
stage alongside President Wickremesinghe. This 
conduct is being viewed as an indirect but clear ges-
ture of support for the President. This development 
is particularly noteworthy as the Sri Lanka Freedom 
Party, to which Ramanathan belongs, currently does 
not form part of President Wickremesinghe's gov-
ernment.
Adding to the intrigue, it has been reported that 
Angajan's participation in these meetings was not 
the result of a formal invitation, suggesting a delib-
erate and personal choice to align with President 
Wickremesinghe, thereby challenging his party's 
directives. This bold political move by Ramanathan 
is poised to ignite discussions and debates in the 
corridors of power, indicating a potential shift in the 
political landscape
