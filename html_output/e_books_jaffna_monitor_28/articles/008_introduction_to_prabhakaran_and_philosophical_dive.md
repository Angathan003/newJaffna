Introduction to Prabhakaran and 
Philosophical Divergences
In 1977, 
Kumanan alias 
Kumanasami, 
an acquaintance 
I met regularly 
in the Jaffna 
Public Library 
reference 
section, 
introduced me 
to Pirabakaran. 
His brother 
was already 
a member 
of LTTE. 
Kumanan was 
one of thirteen 
members who 
split from LTTE 
and formed 
the People's Liberation Organisation of 
Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) organization.

Influence of Global Terrorism and 
Prabhakaran's Stance
The seventies were the heyday of terrorism 
committed by many Palestinian militant groups 
such as the Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO), Black September Organization (BSO), 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
(PFLP), Japanese Red Army (JRA), Palestine 
Liberation Front (PLF), etc. They were involved 
in extreme terrorist activities, including hijacking 
planes, bombing public areas, kidnapping and 
murdering civilians, and targeting sports figures. 
These actions were globally condemned as 
acts of terrorism. Prabhakaran must have been 
influenced by the terrorist activities of Palestinian 
groups. When I met him for the first time, he 
said, "Liberation can be achieved only through 
terrorism." This statement really affected me. 
I countered that terrorism would not help our 
quest for national liberation. The acts of terrorism 
by the Palestinian movement have, in fact, 
significantly damaged all liberation movements 
around the world. These actions cast suspicion on 
them worldwide and blurred the lines between 
genuine liberation struggles and terrorism.
