In a recent training session for poultry farm-
ers in Vavuniya, Dr. Kiruba Nanda Kumaran, a 
veterinary surgeon, shared his expertise on the 
topic of broiler chicken consumption. The pri-
mary focus of the session revolved around the 
question: "Is eating broiler chicken meat bene-
ficial or harmful?" This led to a detailed discus-
sion among the participants about the health 
implications of consuming broiler chicken.
Health Risks Linked to Broiler Chicken
The participants raised concerns about the 
health risks associated with broiler chicken. 
Dr. Kumaran noted that these worries included 
connections to diabetes, heart attacks, high 
cholesterol, hypertension, and cancer. The 
discussion compared broiler chickens, often 
raised on diets considered 
harmful to humans, to coun-
try chickens known for their 
natural diet and perceived 
health benefits.
The Rapid Growth Concern
A central point of the discus-
sion was the rapid growth 
rate of broiler chickens. Dr 
Kumaran observed that while 
traditional chickens take 
about six months to mature, 
modern broilers reach maturity in just 40-50 
days. He listened as participants voiced their 
concerns that this accelerated growth could 
have potential health implications for consum-
ers.
Hormonal Injections and Early 
Puberty in Girls
Dr. Kumaran highlighted a 
significant issue discussed 
during the session: the alleged 
use of hormone injections in 
broiler chickens and its po-
tential link to early puberty 
in girls. He cited observations 
from participants, particularly 
middle-aged women, who no-
ticed their daughters reaching 
puberty around 10 years old,

earlier than the historical norm. This 
was attributed to the consumption of 
broiler chicken, with participants ref-
erencing medical opinions and infor-
mation from social media.
Examining Dietary Patterns and 
Lifestyle Changes
Dr. Kumaran facilitated a discussion 
on the participants' chicken con-
sumption habits and the diets of their 
children, which often included a high 
intake of sugary and processed foods 
and regular consumption of fast food. 
He emphasized the importance of 
considering how lifestyle changes and 
reduced physical activities compared to past genera-
tions could impact health and growth.
Dispelling Myths and Concluding Observations
In his closing remarks, Dr. Kumaran addressed the 
myths surrounding broiler chickens. He stressed 
that globally, chickens are selected based on rigor-
ous research and raised in controlled environments 
with carefully calculated nutrients. He clarified that 
the impact of hormone injections on human growth 
is unsupported by scientific evidence. However, he 
acknowledged that the misuse of antibiotics in poultry 
farming is a valid concern. Dr. Kumaran concluded 
by reassuring the participants that well-raised and 
properly cooked broiler chicken is generally safe for 
consumption.
