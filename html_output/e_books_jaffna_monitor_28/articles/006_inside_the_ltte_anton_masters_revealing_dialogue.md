Inside the LTTE: Anton Master's 
Revealing Dialogue
KT Sivakumar, known as Anton Master, is one 
of the early members of the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). A close friend of LTTE 
leader Prabhakaran, he was a member of the 
Central Committee of the LTTE when it had such 
a structure before the organization transformed 
into a movement with sole leadership. He served 
as LTTE's head of the Military Office (MO), which 
he formed to convert the LTTE military wing into a 
formidable fighting force. He represented the LTTE 
in the two Thimphu peace talks in Bhutan with 
Thilakar. 
In 1988, during the tenure of the Indian Peace-
Keeping Force, Anton Master left the LTTE due 
to a disagreement with Prabhakaran. For over 35 
years, Anton Master has remained uninvolved in 
any activities associated with the Liberation Tigers 
or political matters. This narrative stems from a 
long conversation I had with him after considerable 
effort.
He does not want to talk negatively about the 
LTTE, an organization with which he spent 
his prime years, and certainly does not wish to 
disparage Prabhakaran, his one-time close friend. 
He stresses that the LTTE era is a closed chapter in 
his life, one he prefers not to revisit. Nevertheless, 
after considerable persuasion, he consented to a 
conversation with me. It seems his willingness 
is driven by a hope that future generations might 
learn from the LTTE leadership's past errors. 
He expressed no surprise at the LTTE's military 
defeat in 2009, attributing their downfall to an 
earlier juncture â€“ particularly when their leader, 
Prabhakaran, dismissed the possibility of an 
interim government solution offered by India in 
1988. He remains reluctant to engage in interviews, 
preferring to call it a dialogue. Here is the dialogue 
I had with him. We present it in two parts, with the 
following part appearing in our next issue.
Sincerely,
