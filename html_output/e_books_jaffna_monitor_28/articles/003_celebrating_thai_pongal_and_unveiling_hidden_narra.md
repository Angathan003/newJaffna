Dear Readers,
As the warmth of Thai Pongal fills the air, we at Jaffna Monitor extend our 
heartiest wishes for a joyous and prosperous festival to all our readers across 
the globe. Thai Pongal, a cornerstone in the Tamil cultural calendar, symbol-
izes gratitude, new beginnings, and the timeless bond of community. This 
special edition brings stories that resonate with the spirit of revelation and 
introspection inherent to this auspicious time.

Our highlight is the much-anticipated dialog with KT Sivakumar, known 
as Anton Master. A pivotal early member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE), Anton Master breaks over three decades of silence in a candid 
conversation with Jaffna Monitor, sharing insights and reflections that prom-
ise to be a revelation to many.
In our ongoing series, 'Mahathaya's Saga: Power, Paranoia, and Politics in 
LTTE,' we initially planned to conclude the narrative in this issue. However, 
the depth and complexity of the story have led us to extend the series. We 
delve deeper into the intricate web of power, paranoia, and politics defining a 
critical LTTE era.
Enhancing the diversity of our content, Fisheries Minister Douglas Devanan-
da recently provided a comprehensive interview with our reporter, David 
Ignatius. In this interview, the Minister delves into various topics, sharing his 
experiences and viewpoints, thereby presenting our readers with a layered 
perspective on contemporary and historical events.
We also present the second part of 'The Captain,' a masterpiece by Sho-
basakthi. Brilliantly translated by the esteemed Tamil-English translator 
eḻuttukkiṉiyavaṉ, this narrative continues to captivate our readers with its 
profound storytelling and cultural resonance.
As we embrace the festive spirit of Thai Pongal, we hope this issue of Jaffna 
Monitor offers you both enlightenment and enjoyment. May this festival of 
harvest bring abundant joy and prosperity to you and your loved ones.
Warm regards,
