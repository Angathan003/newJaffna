efore delving into the details that led to Mahathaya's 
arrest and subsequent execution, let's take a detour 
to explore the broader impact of this situation. The 
Mahathaya's dilemma was far-reaching, resulting not only 
in his death but also in the demise of 14 other high-ranking 
LTTE officers. This figure was confirmed by LTTE leader 
Prabhakaran himself to one of our sources, albeit with a 
tone of regretful guilt, as if acknowledging a grave mistake. 
Additionally, a significant number of fighters, numbers 
varying from 100 to 450 from the Mahathaya faction, were 
killed. Nobody knows the actual number.

According to multiple sources within the 
LTTE that spoke with the Jaffna Monitor, 
both LTTE chief Prabhakaran and intelligence 
chief Pottu Amman acted in ways that were 
considered unreasonable. While Prabhakaran's 
actions might have stemmed from paranoia 
towards RAW (Research and Analysis Wing, 
India's intelligence agency) or insecurity about 
Mahathaya, who at the time had become a 
prominent face of the LTTE, overshadowing 
Prabhakaran, many believe that Pottu 
Amman's actions were driven by a specific 
agenda to climb the leadership ladder within 
the LTTE.
The Tragic Fate of LTTE 
Commanders: The Story of Suseelan 
and Many Others
The LTTE leadership carried out widespread 
executions that went far beyond just 
Mahathaya. Among those executed were 
technically skilled Susselan, the area 
commander of Kilinochchi, and Sengamalm, 
who had a significant role under Mahathaya at 
the time of his capture. Sengamalm was once a 
trusted bodyguard of Prabhakaran, the LTTE 
leader. Additionally, Prem Master, who played 
an important part in the Tamil Rehabilitation 
Organisation (TRO) - a covert arm of 
the LTTE functioning as an international 
organization aimed at helping Tamils - was 
also executed, among others.
Entangled in a chaotic nexus of brutality and 
authority were several influential members of 
the LTTE. Brigadier Theepan, previously the 
chief bodyguard of Mahathaya, ascended to 
command the LTTE's formidable northern 
front military units. Concurrently, Colonel 
Jeyam, who had overseen the vital Vavuniya 
sector, suffered unspeakable torment and 
distress. Amid their tribulations, both Jayam 
and Theepan were subjected to the brutal and 
inhumane removal of their fingernails and 
toenails.
Within the LTTE, it is said that Prabhakaran 
summoned Jayam following his release. 
Prabhakaran reportedly expressed remorse 
and suggested that Jayam leaves for a foreign 
country, offering LTTE's assistance in helping 
him settle there. However, as a battle-hardened 
fighter, Jayam refused to leave the organization 
despite the unimaginable tortures he had 
endured. He declared his intention to fight 
until death. True to his word, he died on May 
18, 2009, the final day of the LTTE's military 
existence. 
Suseelan: The Rise and Fall of an 
LTTE Commander
Suseelan, whose real name is Gowriharan, 
was known as Kannan among his village 
community and school friends. Originating 
from a well-known and prosperous upper-
middle-class family in Nelliyady, Jaffna district, 
Suseelan's father, Rasanayagam, owned a petrol 
and service station at the Nelliyady junction. 
In addition to this, Rasanayagam also owned 
extensive properties in the Jaffna and Wanni 
regions, including farms. Suseelan studied at 
Hartley College, Point Pedro. From childhood, 
he was technically sound and mechanically 
inclined. In a candid talk with ' Jaffna Monitor,' 
a close friend of Suseelan, who studied with 
him at Hartley College, said that Suseelan had 
always been exceptionally talented in technical 
fields. He demonstrated this during a school 
exhibition by ingeniously creating biogas from 
cow dung and chicken droppings and then 
using this biogas to power a generator. This 
innovation was particularly significant as, at 
that time, the Jaffna district was isolated from 
electricity supply, and sources like petrol and 
diesel were extremely scarce.

As a member of the second batch of trainees 
under Indian officers at Jawalamukhi, Suseelan 
stood out due to his remarkable abilities. 
One of his batchmates shared insights about 
Suseelan with Jaffna Monitor. He characterized 
Suseelan as being not only kind and good-
hearted but also exceptionally intelligent. 
According to this batchmate, Suseelan was 
distinguished by his strict discipline, natural 
leadership qualities, and an unwavering 
passion for freedom.
Suseelan was indeed a prominent figure in 
the LTTE and a key leader. His presence 
was significant during the event when the 
LTTE surrendered its arms, a maneuver 
orchestrated by the Indian Government. This 
highly publicized ceremony was held at the 
Palaly airfield in October 1987, where "Yogi" 
Yogaratham formally relinquished his arms. 
Suseelan accompanied Yogi at this event and 
surrendered his pistol as well.
A significant display of Suseelan's abilities 
emerged during the Battle of Pooneryn in 
November 1993, also known as Operation 
Thavalai Paachchal (Frog Leap) by the LTTE. 
In this engagement, the LTTE successfully 
captured two T55 tanks. The difficulty, 
however, lay in maneuvering these tanks, as 
the fighters lacked training and familiarity 
with their operation. Sources from the LTTE 
reveal that Suseelan, armed with his robust 
mechanical expertise, skillfully managed to 
operate these tanks, overcoming a complex 
and challenging task. According to an LTTE 
source, one of these tanks was extensively 
used, including in a significant instance where 
it was successfully deployed to attack a Dvora 
naval boat.
Another friend of Suseelan shared additional 
insights into his family's ties with the 
LTTE. He mentioned that Suseelan's family 
were among the early supporters of the 
LTTE, dating back to the late 1970s. When 
Mahathaya established his base in Nelliyady, 
a few young men rented one of the family 
houses owned by Suseelan's family, posing 
as students. One day, these individuals 
launched an attack on a police jeep, resulting 
in the deaths of four police officers. A Tamil 
police officer named Sittampalam narrowly 
escaped with minor injuries. This incident led 
Suseelan's family to realize that those residing 
in their house were not students but LTTE 
militants, and their younger son Gowriharan

was assisting them. Gowriharan later joined 
the LTTE, adopting the name Suseelan. 
There's a fascinating story behind his nom de 
guerre, 'Suseelan.' Credible sources told the 
Jaffna Monitor that Gowriharan selected this 
name in honour of his cousin Suseelan, a high-
ranking officer in the Malaysian army who 
tragically died in an accident. It was mentioned 
that Suseelan's family moved back to Nelliyady 
from Malaysia after the Second World War, 
and some relatives continue to live in Malaysia.
Visu, the assassin of Amirthalingam, along 
with Dominic, previously the leader of LTTE's 
Jaffna district political wing, Newton, a senior 
member of the LTTE's intelligence wing, and 
Mohan, were all childhood friends of Suseelan, 
having studied together and hailed from the 
same place Nelliady.
Dominic was once a prominent figure in the 
LTTE, serving as the leader of LTTE's Jaffna 
district political wing. A former prominent 
LTTE guard shared an intriguing story about 
him with the Jaffna Monitor. He mentioned 
that LTTE supremo Prabhakaran often 
took credit for the victories of the LTTE. 
According to our source, who served in the 
LTTE for nearly 30 years, he never witnessed 
Prabhakaran accepting responsibility for a 
military loss. There was a saying in the LTTE, 
he noted: 'ntd;why; Njrpaj; jiytupd; 
rPupa rpe;jid. Njhw;why; jsgjpfspd; 
jtW>" which loosely translates to, 'If won, it's 
the wise thought of the national leader. If lost, 
it's the fault of the commanders.' 
During the Battle of Janakapura, also known 
as the Maṇalāṟu attack on July 25, 1993, 
which led to a significant defeat for the LTTE, 
Dominic, renowned for his sharp wit, boldly 
questioned who would be held accountable 
in the current situation. S.P. Thamilselvan, 
who worked under Dominic then, noted 
this comment and relayed it to Prabhakaran.

Enraged by the comment, Prabhakaran swiftly 
dismissed Dominic from his position and 
expelled him from the LTTE, appointing 
Thamilselvan as his successor. Consequently, 
Thamilselvan ascended to the leadership of the 
LTTE's political wing, a rise attributed to his 
cunning political maneuvering.
An intriguing tale also surrounds Mohan, an 
early childhood friend of Suseelan. His father, 
Sankunni Nair, a Malayalee, was married to 
a Sri Lankan Tamil woman. Sankunni Nair 
owned a tea shop in Nelliyadi, famously 
known as 'Sangunni Kadai,' which was quite 
popular then. Mohan, an LTTE fighter, mainly 
works as a driver. He was even rumoured to 
have been the driver for Prabhakaran and 
his wife Mathivathani on their wedding day. 
During the tenure of the Indian Peace Keeping 
Force (IPKF), Sankunni Nair kept up amicable 
relations with the Indian Army due to their 
shared roots. Sadly, this association had a dire 
outcome; he was assassinated by the LTTE 
under suspicion of being an informant for 
India.
When Mahathaya, his commander, was 
arrested, Suseelan 
remained undaunted. He 
confided to his friends, 
who later shared with 
the Jaffna Monitor, that 
he harboured no fear of 
arrest or repercussions, 
firmly believing he 
had committed no 
wrongdoing. During these 
turbulent times, a close 
friend of Suseelan met 
with him in Vavuniya and 
urged him to leave the 
LTTE and relocate to a 
foreign country. Despite 
this advice, Suseelan resolutely refused. He was 
adamant in believing that he had done nothing 
wrong and could not abandon the LTTE. He 
also expressed that he couldn't run away like a 
coward, especially without making mistakes.
Suseelan was not immediately arrested 
following Mahathaya's arrest; he was allowed 
to move freely for several months. It was 
during this time that Suseelan married his 
girlfriend, Kalpana, whose two elder brothers 
and another sister, all LTTE fighters, had 
perished in battle. The wedding, orchestrated 
by the LTTE, saw the attendance of notable 
figures, including Anton Balasingam, 
the LTTE's chief political strategist, and 
Balasingham Nadesan, the head of the 
organization's police force. There were 
rumours that Pottu Amman, the LTTE's 
intelligence chief, was the chief guest at the 
wedding, but insiders dismissed these as 
baseless. Although the LTTE expressed a 
desire to sponsor the event, Suseelan's father, 
Rasanayagam, a prosperous businessman, 
insisted on funding the wedding himself. The 
entire event was meticulously documented 
through photographs and videos by the LTTE.

During a standard one-month 
leave granted to newlyweds by the 
LTTE, Suseelan was summoned 
by Pottu Amman less than three 
weeks after his wedding. After he 
met with Pottu Amman, Suseelan 
was arrested and never returned. 
Initially, Suseelan's father and 
siblings knew about his arrest but 
chose to keep it from his mother, 
affectionately known as Mani 
Akka, who had a special fondness 
for him as the youngest child in the 
family. However, a neighbour inadvertently 
told Mani Akka about Suseelan's arrest. This 
revelation led to her tragic and immediate 
death from shock. The LTTE leadership's 
callous nature was further highlighted during 
the last rites of Suseelan's mother. According 
to Srilankan Tamil culture, the youngest son 
traditionally performs these rites. Despite the 
family's pleading with the LTTE leadership to 
allow Suseelan to fulfill this sacred duty, their 
requests were mercilessly denied.
A close friend of Suseelan spoke with the 
'Jaffna Monitor' about how deeply Suseelan's 
family was affected by the back-to-back 
shocks. He mentioned that Anton Balasingam, 
the LTTE's chief strategist, frequently visited 
Suseelan's house in Nelliyadi. Suseelan's home, 
renowned for its extensive library and a wide 
array of English news magazines worldwide, 
was an appealing stop for Balasingam. During 
his visits, he often asked for 'egg coffee,' a 
unique mixture of coffee, egg, and hot water, 
thoroughly blended, which was specially 
prepared by Suseelan's mother, Mani Akka.
He also said that Additionally, prominent 
LTTE figures like Shankar, founder of the 
air wing and marine division, and Selvarasa 
Pathmanathan, the chief arms procurement 
officer, frequently visited Suseelan's house, 
often boldly requesting meals from Suseelan's 
mother in a rightful manner akin to asking for 
food from someone's own mother. However, 
Suseelan's close friend lamented to 'Jaffna 
Monitor' that despite these connections, none 
of these LTTE members offered any assistance 
to his family in bringing Suseelan home for the 
last rite.
Up to the present, the LTTE has not issued any 
formal statement concerning the supposed 
misdeeds of Suseelan or the rationale behind 
his execution. Additionally, the exact date of 
his death remains undocumented. Suseelan's 
family, as per a close friend, has been waiting 
for over three decades. They are cognizant 
of his passing but are eager to determine the 
precise date to conduct a Moksha Archana, 
a ritual performed for the tranquillity of 
departed souls. This friend also mentioned that 
after the war's conclusion and the demise of 
LTTE leaders Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman, 
numerous senior LTTE officials approached 
Suseelan's family, extending their sympathies 
and expressing regret for their failure to 
prevent the injustices Suseelan suffered. 
Will be continued.....
