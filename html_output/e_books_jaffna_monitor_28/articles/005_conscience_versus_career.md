Sri Lanka's political scene, always buzzing 
with intense rivalries and sudden changes, has 
just witnessed a remarkable event. SJB MP 
Chaminda Wijesiri, in an unexpected move, 
has stepped down from Parliament. This is 
quite unusual in a setting where political roles 
are usually held fiercely, sparking a wave of 
debates and speculation.
Wijesiri's resignation breaks the typical pattern 
in Sri Lankan politics. It came as a shock to 
many, especially since politicians in Sri Lanka 
are known for their stronghold on power. 
Right after a budget vote, the timing points to 
some deep thinking behind his decision.
During an emotional goodbye speech in 
Parliament, Wijesiri shared his worries about 
the growing dislike for politicians among the 
public. This dislike has become so intense 
that it's affecting even the families of MPs. 
His stepping down raises essential questions 
about the values and principles of other 
MPs who choose to stay on despite public 
dissatisfaction.
In Sri Lanka, government MPs often face 
harsher criticism than their counterparts in the 
opposition, including threats and even violent 
attacks. Yet, such intense pressure has rarely 
led to resignations, highlighting different 
attitudes towards public opinion across 
political groups.
Wijesiri intends to remain active in politics 
with the SJB and appears optimistic about his 
future in elections. However, his resignation 
brings up a bigger question: will ongoing

public frustration lead to more changes 
or shifts in other MPs' actions? This is 
complicated by people's general mistrust 
towards politicians, who are often seen as self-
serving.
This incident has also caused some uncertainty 
within the SJB, particularly for its leader, 
Sajith Premadasa. There's a concern that new 
MPs might change sides, as has happened 
before. The unpredictable nature of Sri Lankan 
politics, where surprising alliances are not 
uncommon, adds to this unpredictability.
Moreover, this situation also prompts us to 
think about the role of money and influence in 
Sri Lankan politics. Pursuing political power 
often clashes with public trust and honesty.
In summary, Wijesiri's resignation is more 
than just a single event. It mirrors the 
complex and often stormy nature of politics 
in Sri Lanka. It highlights the challenges in 
balancing personal goals, serving the public, 
and the ever-shifting power dynamics and 
public perception in Sri Lankan politics.
