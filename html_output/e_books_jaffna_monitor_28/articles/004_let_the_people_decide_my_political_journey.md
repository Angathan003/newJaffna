Let the People Decide 
My Political Journey: 
Exclusive Interview with 
Minister Douglas Devananda 
Douglas Devananda, the Minister of Fisheries and the only 
cabinet minister representing the Northern Tamils, recently did 
an in-depth interview wi th our reporter, David Ignatius. Here, 
we present this exclusive conversation. 
You organized President Ranil's visit to the Northern 
Province. Was the visit successful?
 The visit was undeniably successful. President Ranil's four-
day stay in Jaffna included meetings with diverse groups. He

pledged to allocate funds specifically for 
improving the region's education, healthcare, 
development, and employment prospects. This 
allowed various stakeholders direct access 
to the President, allowing them to express 
their concerns and proposals. President 
expressed his disappointment over the failure 
to utilize the available political solutions. He 
also mentioned that the government would 
not obstruct the implementation of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution. Overall, he 
considered this visit to be successful.
There are accusations against you 
for not advocating Tamil nationalistic 
policies. What is your response?
 There seems to be a deliberate narrative being 
spun to portray me as anti-Tamil nationalism. 
However, like cholesterol, which is categorized 
into 'good' and 'bad' types, Tamil nationalism 
also has its positive and negative aspects. 
Good cholesterol can benefit human health, 
whereas bad cholesterol can lead to death. 
Similarly, positive Tamil Tesiyam (Tamil 
nationalism) can undoubtedly benefit Sri 
Lankan Tamils. On the other hand, negative 
Tamil Desiyam, exploited by some Sri Lankan 
Tamil parties, instigates innocent Tamils 
without offering practical solutions akin to 
harmful cholesterol. I support and advocate 
for positive Tamil nationalistic policies, but I 
am firmly against negative Tamil nationalism. 
This stance does not mean I oppose Tamil 
nationalism entirely.
Organizations like the Tamil National 
Alliance and Tamil National People's Front 
often instigate innocent people and the 
younger generation without guiding them 
towards a concrete resolution. This, in my 
view, represents 'bad Tamil nationalism.' I 
consciously choose not to engage in such 
practices. Instead, my efforts are directed 
towards improving infrastructure in the 
North and East, enhancing the quality of life 
for the people, and providing employment 
opportunities to young men and women. In 
recent years, I've successfully secured jobs 
for several thousand individuals in the North 
and East. This initiative has significantly 
reduced their need to migrate abroad in 
search of employment. Had I not facilitated 
these job opportunities, many might have 
migrated overseas, potentially leading to a 
further exodus from the North and East, 
including those marrying the young diaspora. 
Preserving the existence of the Eelam Tamil 
community and planning for our future is a 
more pragmatic approach, rather than pushing 
our younger generation to migrate.
Recently, residents from the Vasavilan area, 
partially located within a high-security zone, 
approached me for assistance in releasing 
a temple. I assured them of my help and 
explained that with their support, through 
their votes and additional parliamentary 
seats, I could serve them more effectively. 
When one individual questioned how I could

expect people to vote for me and what I had 
done against the government, I replied, 'If 
that's your perspective, you have come to 
the wrong person. You should be taking 
your concerns to those who consistently 
oppose the government. You come to me 
because, deep down, you know I am capable 
of bringing about positive change.' He had no 
response to this. Many Tamil parties use Tamil 
nationalism merely as an election slogan. 
However, I hold it as a deep-seated belief.
What is your stance on the 13th 
Amendment?
The issue of rights for the Tamil people should 
have been resolved by signing the India-Sri 
Lanka accord. At that juncture, approximately 
651 LTTE members and a total of around 
2,000 individuals, including other members 
from the liberation organizations and the 
general public, had perished. However, the 
failure to capitalize on this opportunity led 
to the indiscriminate loss of many thousands 
more lives until the conflict's culmination in 
Mullivaikkal in 2009. The crux of the error lies 
in the Tamil leadership's inability to utilize the 
chance they were given. This is the stance we 
maintain.
My stance on the 13th Amendment is clear: 
I've never viewed it as the final resolution 
for the Tamil people in Sri Lanka. Instead, 
it should be approached as a starting point. 
Tamil political parties must develop a strategic 
plan that acknowledges the 13th Amendment 
as a foundational element while striving to 
extend rights beyond its current scope. This 
approach is essential for progress towards a 
more comprehensive resolution that better 
addresses the aspirations and needs of the 
Tamil community. I have developed such 
a plan. The critical question remains: do 
the parties opposing the 13th Amendment 
offer any practical, achievable strategies 
to secure political rights for the Tamil 
community? All parties, fearing Prabhakaran, 
opposed the 13th Amendment when it was 
introduced. Tamil National Alliance (TNA) 
declared they wouldn't even touch it with a 
broomstick. Now, the shift in their perception 
is evident as they have come to accept the 
13th Amendment. Yet, like the party of 
Gajendrakumar, Tamil National People's 
Front, those who still refuse to accept it and 
label its supporters as traitors, what solution 
do they offer for the Tamil people? It's nothing 
but incendiary politics, misleading the people 
with bad Tamil nationalism. that misleads 
the public through rhetoric rather than truth. 
Such politics merely contribute to confusion 
and false hope. What we are observing is mere 
political maneuvering. This version of Tamil 
nationalism is harmful; it neither presents 
the truth nor properly leads the people. It's 
characterized by spreading misinformation. 
Contrasting this approach of empty promises, 
it's imperative to ask: What definitive action 
plan does the Tamil National People's Front 
have to secure and enhance the political rights 
of the Sri Lankan Tamil people? Moving 
beyond mere rhetoric to focus on realistic and 
actionable strategies is crucial for truly serving 
the community's best interests.
The party of Gajendrakumar, which advocates 
for 'one country, two nations,' ironically 
starts with 'All-Ceylon.' Both MPs from his 
party, Benz Gajendrakumar and 'Kai Pillai' 
S. Kajendran, have accepted Sri Lanka as one 
nation by swearing in as MPs and abiding by 
its constitutional framework. Why this double 
standard? They accept Sri Lanka as their 
country to enjoy parliamentary privileges, and 
their party lawyers earn substantial fees in 
courts accepting Sri Lanka as one country. Is 
this fair?

Could you elaborate on the 
fundamental ideological differences 
you had with Velupillai Prabhakaran?
I cannot fathom, even in my wildest dreams, 
the idea of killing a friend who once shared 
the same mat with me. Yet, Prabhakaran did 
precisely that. My fundamental disagreement 
with Prabhakaran has always been profound, 
especially regarding his violent tactics. He 
orchestrated the killings within other militant 
groups, a kind of fratricide. During my time 
in Chennai in the late 1980s, Prabhakaran sent 
his close aide, Shankar, alias Sornalingam, 
who later became a prominent LTTE member, 
to persuade me to join their ranks. I told 
Shankar to convey a message to Prabhakaran: 
he must first put an end to the sibling killings. 
I emphasized to Shankar that liberation 
movements should cease three types of 
violence: internal killings within the militant 
organizations, fratricidal killings between 
different militant groups, and the killing of 
members of the Tamil community who hold 
differing opinions.
Prabhakaran attempted to assassinate me at 
least a dozen times, but each attempt failed 
miserably. When I returned to Sri Lanka from 
India in 1990, despite warnings from everyone 
about the high risk of Prabhakaran succeeding 
in killing me, I remained confident that he 
could not. A leader must be able to protect 
people and his organization. Prabhakaran 
lacked both of these qualities. I am wholly 
opposed to Prabhakaran's destructive 
political methods. I harbor no doubts about 
Prabhakaran being a Venomous animal. 
In the final stages of the war, Prabhakaran 
resorted to using thousands of innocent Tamil 
civilians as human shields, a strategy aimed at 
his own protection. Although I cannot delve 
deeper into the details, it is undeniable that 
the circumstances surrounding his end at 
Mullivaikkal were deeply shameful.
But I distinguish between LTTE fighters 
and their leadership. I hold no anger against 
them. This includes the suicide bombers who 
came to kill me and other LTTE fighters. I 
even forgave Sathiyaleela, who brought a 
suicide bomber to my office. I openly stated 
in court that I had no objections to releasing 
Sathiyaleela and would discuss her release 
with the law minister. This was also raised 
when President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited 
Jaffna, and I reiterated my stance. I don't have 
any personal hatred towards LTTE fighters. 
Many former fighters and LTTE members now 
work with me. A key figure from the LTTE's 
'Voice of Tigers' radio station now works with 
me. It's not fair to interpret my opposition to 
Prabhakaran's brutal politics and fratricidal 
killings as criticism of the LTTE fighters who 
were tragically brainwashed by the LTTE.
You called Selvarajah Kajendran, 
a member of the National List of 
the Tamil National People's Front, 
'Kaipillai,' and it has become the 
headlines of the newspapers...?
During his tenure as the leader of the 
Jaffna University Student Union, Selvarajah 
Kajendran faced accusations from the parents 
of numerous innocent students. They claimed 
he incited and forcibly sent hundreds of 
students to join the Tigers. Tragically, many of 
these students reportedly lost their lives. These 
grieving parents came to me, sharing their 
anguish over this situation.
Since joining the Tamil National Alliance with 
the LTTE's backing, Selvarajah Kajendran has 
perpetuated provocative politics. Notably, in

a 2002 parliamentary speech, he alarmingly 
stated, 'Prepare 40,000 coffins; we will return 
40,000 Sinhalese soldiers as corpses from 
Jaffna.' This incendiary remark significantly 
angered the Sinhalese community and 
exacerbated Sinhalese-Tamil tensions. In 
2008, at the war's peak, He reportedly fled to 
a European country, sought asylum, and got 
married there. Post-war, he allegedly returned 
to Sri Lanka following a purported deal with 
then-Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
Before he departed from the country, he was 
reportedly approached by Kutti, responsible 
for vehicles within the LTTE, regarding the car 
allotted to him by the Parliament. Allegedly, 
Kajendran informed Kutti that releasing 
the car required a payment of Rs. 4 million. 
It is claimed by credible sources that Kutti, 
using LTTE funds, provided this amount 
to Kajendran, who then secured the vehicle 
and kept it safe before leaving for abroad. 
Subsequently, during the height of the war 
and after marrying overseas, he is said to 
have bought land and constructed a house 
in Manaltharai Lane, Jaffna, where he now 
resides comfortably.
Kajendran organized a procession from 
Pothuvil in the Eastern Province to Jaffna to 
pay tribute to Thileepan. This procession was 
intercepted and attacked by Sinhalese people 
at Kappalthurai, Trincomalee. The video of 
the attack shows him, terrified by the assault, 
fleeing like a coward without fighting back. 
While I don't justify the attack, he, who often 
incites others with brave rhetoric, should have 
confronted the attack directly.
In 1983, I was attacked by Sinhalese thugs 
in Welikada Prison. My comrades and I 
confronted the attack with the moderate 
weapons we had. Similarly, in 1998, in 
Kalutara Prison, I was attacked by Tamil thugs 
suspected of being Tigers. I fought back using 
my bare hands as weapons. In both situations, 
I didn't run away like a coward. While I 
condemn the attack on Kajendran, I firmly 
believe that his act of running away like a 
coward is disgraceful. That's why I refer to him 
as 'Kaipillai' Kajendran. Kajendran's actions 
sometimes remind us of the famous comedy 
actor Vadivelu's legendary character 'Kaipillai.' 
In this role, Kaipillai pretends to be brave in 
public, but in reality, he is very much scared. 
This similarity is why I draw the comparison.
 You were pretty critical of 
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam 
regarding the murder of his father, 
Kumar Ponnambalam. Could you 
elaborate on that?
Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam's father, 
Kumar Ponnambalam, was a friend of mine. 
He led a life of luxury in central Colombo, and 
his residence's yard was consistently filled with 
numerous Benz cars. Once, in a lighter vein, 
I suggested that he could sell one of those 
Benz cars to aid thousands of Tamil people. 
He responded, 'I say, that's a separate issue; 
politics is different.
In 1998, I survived a narrow brush with 
death when I was attacked by the Tigers 
in Kalutara prison. When I returned from 
the hospital, Kumar Ponnambalam and 
his son, Gajendrakumar, visited my house. 
During that visit, Kumar admonished me, 
questioning, 'Don't you know they (the Tigers) 
are murderers? Why did you go to see them? 
We knew something like this would happen. 
That's precisely why we never visit the Tigers 
in prison.' Gajendrakumar cannot deny that 
this incident took place.

I was deeply saddened upon learning of 
Kumar Ponnambalam's murder. It was a 
tragic event, which I have consistently and 
vehemently condemned from that day to the 
present. However, Gajendrakumar has never 
initiated any legal proceedings concerning 
his father's murder. He has avoided this 
because a thorough investigation might unveil 
the identity of the murderer, potentially 
jeopardizing Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam's 
political career. I believe the fear that such an 
investigation could label him as the son of a 
traitor, in the LTTE supporters's view, is the 
primary reason Gajendrakumar has refrained 
from pursuing any legal action regarding his 
father's murder.
The struggle of the relatives of those 
who disappeared due to the war still 
continues...
Among the Tamil politicians in the North, I 
am the one who fully understands the pain 
of the families of the disappeared, as I am 
also one of them. This is because my brother, 
Premananda, was abducted by the LTTE and 
subsequently disappeared. (He takes a small 
pocket diary from his shirt pocket and shows 
a news clipping about his younger brother 
Premananda's disappearance.) In this way, I, 
too, belong to the category of relatives of the 
disappeared. My mother, Maheswari, passed 
away when we were children, and we were 
raised by our father, Kathiravelu, and his 
sister, Parameswari. When they learned that 
my brother Premananda had been abducted 
and disappeared by the Tigers, they were 
inconsolable, like a cow that had lost its calf.
Holding onto the hope that Premananda was 
still alive, my father, foster mother, and other 
siblings often discussed this with me. They 
pleaded with me to search for Premananda. 
However, knowing the nature of the LTTE 
leadership, I was aware that Premananda had 
been killed by the Tigers. But, out of respect 
for their feelings, I never disclosed to them my 
belief that Premananda could have been killed 
by the Tigers. My father and foster mother 
passed away without knowing the truth about 
what happened to Premananda. Not only 
my own brother but also many of my close 
comrades, including Maheswari Velautham, a 
human rights lawyer; Atputharajah Nadarajah, 
the founding editor of the magazine 
Thinamurasu; and Balanadarajah Iyer, editor 
of Thinamurasu, were killed by the LTTE.

In this way, I can fully empathize with the 
feelings of the relatives of the disappeared. 
Many of these relatives have approached 
me, seeking justice. To them, I say, I am 
one of you. I am not unaware of the pain 
and suffering endured by the families of the 
disappeared. We must seek a resolution for 
their tears. This issue should not be exploited 
for political purposes; instead, we must strive 
to find a just solution.
Considering the long-standing 
issue of Indian fishermen violating 
the maritime boundary, what 
comprehensive plan do you propose 
to effectively put a full stop to this 
persistent problem?
The Sri Lankan government is proactively 
engaged in discussions with New Delhi to 
address the activities of Indian fishermen 
who violate the maritime boundary. 
These fishermen should be apprehended 
without exception. Moreover, it's 
imperative that the nine Members of 
Parliament from the Northern Province 
visit Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to 
converse with Chief Ministers M.K. 
Stalin and N. Rangasamy. Their meetings 
should also extend to local Tamil political 
leaders to accurately convey the situation. 
Such measures could significantly diminish 
the problem. Similarly, fishermen associations 
from the Northern Province need to visit these 
regions to present the actual circumstances. 
Countering the misleading narrative that 
Indian fishermen are merely continuing 
ancient practices without infringing on 
maritime borders and that the Sri Lankan 
navy is disturbing them is crucial. 
Nine Members of Parliament from the 
Northern Province, along with fishermen's 
associations from the same area, should 
clearly communicate to our brethren in Tamil 
Nadu and Puducherry that Indian fishermen, 
by crossing borders and engaging in bottom 
trawling within Sri Lanka's maritime 
territory, are causing significant harm to 
marine resources. This practice leads to the 
deterioration of the sea bed. Such activities not 
only negatively impact the ecosystem but also 
affect the livelihoods of the local population. 
Furthermore, these practices cause damage 
to the marine equipment of northern Tamil 
fishermen, resulting in substantial livelihood 
losses for these individuals.

The current scenario is markedly different 
from the wartime environment. The Sri 
Lankan Navy faces challenges in apprehending 
these fishermen due to the overwhelming 
number of Indian fishing boats and the 
impracticality of using firearms, as was 
previously done. Maritime arrests are 
notably more complex than terrestrial ones. 
However, due to my firm stance, the Navy 
has begun making arrests. I have urged 
Northern Parliamentarians from various 
parties to collaboratively address this issue, 
yet the response has been underwhelming. 
Recently, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs 
Siddharthan and Selvam Adaikalanathan 
have agreed to participate in these efforts. 
If all nine parliamentarians, irrespective of 
their party affiliations, come together and 
make a concerted effort by visiting India, it 
could potentially resolve approximately 70% 
of the issues our fishermen face. This issue 
is a matter of public concern, not a personal 
one. Hence, politicians must set aside party 
divisions and individual ambitions to work 
collaboratively on this pressing matter.
You've mentioned the possibility of 
retiring from politics, particularly 
with the upcoming election potentially 
being your last. Is this indeed your 
plan, and if so, what factors have led 
to this decision?
Recently, there has been speculation about 
my retirement from politics, and it's true that 
I've considered it, especially now that I'm 67 
years old. My life has been wholly dedicated 
to the welfare of the Tamil people. I remain 
active in politics primarily because I feel a 
profound responsibility, being one of the 
few who initiated the armed struggle. This 
commitment is the driving force behind my 
political journey. Abandoning my people is 
not an option for me; doing so would weigh 
heavily on my conscience and disrupt my 
peace. When I decided to return to Sri Lanka 
from India, numerous friends and relatives 
strongly advised against it. They warned of the 
significant dangers I would face, even going 
so far as to say that Prabhakaran would target 
me. Despite these warnings, I was driven 
by an overwhelming sense of duty towards 
our people. The option to settle in India or 
another foreign country, where many of my 
relatives live, and lead a comfortable life was 
available to me. However, such a path held no 
appeal. I sensed a significant gap in the Tamil 
leadership, a vacuum that I felt compelled to 
fill. My return was more than a mere decision; 
it was a calling, a responsibility I felt deeply 
obligated to undertake for the advancement 
and welfare of our people.
To date, My routine is rigorous. I usually 
retire to bed by 10 or 10:30 at night and rise 
at 3 am. In my Jaffna office, I don't even 
have a bed; I often rest right here, adjusting 
myself amidst the files (pointing to a long 
desk in front of him). Personal comfort and 
possessions have never been my priority; I 
have never built anything for my sole benefit, 
and I have no family. The party is my family, 
and ultimately, the support of the Tamil 
people will bolster my political strength. Such 
political strength is crucial for my approach to 
national reconciliation to be fully successful. 
Without political power, achieving significant 
goals is impossible, and I aim to accomplish 
everything that is needed. Therefore, the 
decision of whether I should continue in 
politics or not should rightly rest with the 
people.
