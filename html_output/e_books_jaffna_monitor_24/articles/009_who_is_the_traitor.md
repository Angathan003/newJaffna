Who is the 
Traitor?
Exclusive 
Interview 
with Karuna 
Amman
Part-3
Is it true to what extent you said that 
the Eastern Province fighters were 
marginalized under the leadership of 
the Tigers?
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam organization (LTTE) 
comprised 
26 
main 
structures, and this 
number 
would 
increase if smaller 
structures 
were 
included. 
However, 
individuals 
from 
the 
Eastern 
Province 
were not appointed to 
leadership roles or even 
to second or third-level 
responsibilities in any of

these structures. It is unclear whether this 
was intentional or unintentional, but Eastern 
fighters were significantly excluded from 
leadership positions.
In the context of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam's organizational structure, Pathuman 
was the commander for Trincomalee, while 
I held the commander position in Batticaloa. 
These appointments were notable exceptions, 
as no other individuals from the Eastern 
Province were assigned leading roles, nor were 
they given secondary or tertiary positions in 
any other divisions of the organization.
Fighters from the Eastern Province actively 
participated in all divisions of the LTTE, 
including intelligence, politics, finance, and the 
Sea Tigers. After my decision to leave the LTTE, 
the organization attempted to demonstrate its 
impartiality by promoting Eastern figures like 
Karikalan and Marshal to leadership roles. 
However, this action was viewed by many 
as merely a superficial gesture rather than a 
genuine commitment to inclusivity.
However, I firmly believe that the unequal 
treatment of Eastern fighters by the LTTE 
leadership was not the driving force behind 
my departure from the organization. At that 
time, we did not perceive such disparities as 
urgent or significant. We followed our leader 
Prabhakaran's decisions without question 
or opposition, irrespective of whether he 
appointed leaders from the East or the North. 
Our primary commitment was to the larger 
cause — the liberation struggle of the Tamil 
people. Therefore, the preferential treatment of 
Eastern fighters was not a major concern for us 
and did not influence my decision to leave the 
LTTE. 
If you hadn't separated, some believe 
the Liberation Tigers wouldn't have 
lost the final battle, while others say 
that if Karuna hadn't separated, there 
would have been another Mullivaikkal 
tragedy in the Eastern Province as 
well. What is your opinion on this?
Had we, the Eastern fighters, not separated 
from the mainland Vanni Tigers, the war 
might still be ongoing today. As a key strategist 
behind several of the Tigers' earlier critical 
battles, I likely would have played a similar 
role in the final battle, where Prabhakaran 
met his demise and the LTTE faced military 
defeat. I am convinced that had I been with 
Prabhakaran, he would not have met his end 
in the Nandikadal Lagoon, abandoned like an 
orphaned corpse. 
The commanders who strategically orchestrated 
my departure from the LTTE ultimately failed. 
Not only were they unable to save their leader 
and the organization, but they also acted 
incompetently and met their demise en masse 
in the final days of the conflict.

I believe that Prabhakaran might have 
disregarded my military advice during times 
when the LTTE was faring well, but he would 
likely have considered it during dire situations 
when the challenges were immense. 
Had we not parted ways, the LTTE would 
almost certainly still be engaged in conflict 
to this day. However, whether we would have 
eventually emerged victorious in the war 
remains a matter of debate. On that point, I still 
harbor uncertainties. 
Why is it so?
A war is only truly victorious when military 
successes are translated into political victories, 
and this aspect was notably absent in 
Prabhakaran's strategies and within the LTTE. 
Prabhakaran concentrated solely on military 
means and never fully embraced the potential 
of political victories during his lifetime. 
Therefore, I believe that military triumphs 
alone would not have been sufficient for the 
ultimate success of our cause.
Therefore, if we, the Eastern fighters, had not 
separated, we would have possessed the strength 
and capability to combat the Sri Lankan army. 
I believe that had we been present, neither the 
Tigers nor their leader, Prabhakaran, would 
have met their tragic fate at Mullivaikkal. 
Okay. How would you have prevented 
Prabhakaran's death and the military 
defeat of the LTTE in the final battle?
There's a theory that guerrilla warfare often 
evolves into conventional warfare as it expands. 
An insurgency, initially employing guerrilla 
tactics, 
gains 
ground 
and 
subsequently 
transforms into conventional warfare. While 
reverting to guerrilla tactics after this shift 
is difficult, it is not impossible. As the war 
neared its end, the Tiger leadership should 
have switched back to guerrilla warfare. This 
represents a critical mistake by the LTTE 
leadership – they persisted in a losing war 
using conventional military tactics, following 
the misguided advice of their commanders.
There isn't a single forest or area in the 
North and East that is unfamiliar to me. The 
Vanni mainland, replete with dense forests 
and naturally hidden spots, some almost 
unknown, provided numerous opportunities 
for concealment. Yet, instead of taking refuge 
in these extensive forests, the LTTE leadership 
retreated to a place like Mullivaikkal, from 
which escape was virtually impossible. 
Had the Tigers reverted to guerrilla tactics in 
the final stages and retreated into the forests, 
they might have continued the fight, potentially 
sparing the Tamil people some of the war's 
brutalities. Instead, the LTTE leadership 
funneled both their fighters and civilians into 
a virtually inescapable position at Mullivaikkal. 
This decision was not only foolish and 
nonsensical but also demonstrated a glaring 
lack of military insight. Any military strategist,

even with a basic understanding of warfare, would have 
advised against such a retreat. The mystery remains as 
to who counseled Prabhakaran to move to Mullivaikkal. 
Surprisingly, Prabhakaran, known for his military acumen, 
acquiesced to this strategy. 
If the Tigers had shifted back to guerrilla warfare, their 
leader, Prabhakaran, might have survived. Had I been in 
that situation, I certainly would have adopted this strategy. 
I would have turned the Tiger fighters into guerrillas, 
potentially saving both the organization and its leader, 
Prabhakaran. The extensive wilderness of the Vanni region 
provides ample opportunities for effective guerrilla warfare. 
What is your opinion about the atrocities that 
the LTTE unleashed on its own people in the 
final war?
In the final battle, the LTTE 
resorted to using its arms and 
ammunition against the Tamil 
people it claimed to represent, 
engaging in desperate and reckless 
forced recruitment. Tragically, the 
LTTE employed their own people 
as human shields. Moreover, those 
who attempted to flee the conflict 
zone were met with lethal force, 
shot and killed by the Tigers. 
During the LTTE's final defeat 
at Nandikadal Lagoon, I was 
serving as the Minister of National 
Integration and was involved in 
overseeing the resettlement of 
people at that time. I met many 
individuals who were victims of 
the LTTE's final war madness. They 
shared stories with me about the 
atrocities committed by the LTTE 
in the war's last stages. In some 
cases, the LTTE even killed fathers 
who resisted the forcible abduction 
of 
their 
sons. 
Additionally, 
some LTTE fighters and leaders 
emotionally explained to me how 
a freedom movement, built on 
the dedication and sacrifices of 
its fighters, degenerated into a 
ruthless, heartless organization 
that abducted children in the final 
stages of the war. 
It's a tragic scenario indeed. Had 
I been present, I would have 
certainly opposed such actions. 
Resorting to the forced recruitment 
of young people is a definitive 
sign that a freedom struggle has 
lost its moral compass. One must 
question the kind of fighting spirit

that can be expected from youths coerced into 
combat. True efficacy in battle necessitates 
genuine motivation, something that cannot be 
anticipated from unwilling participants. 
One of the major accusations against 
you is that you also engaged in forced 
recruitment, and there are credible 
pieces of evidence supporting this 
claim. It is alleged that the worst 
instances of recruitment occurred 
in the East during your tenure as a 
commander. What is your response to 
these allegations?
Leader Prabhakaran introduced the 'One 
Fighter per Household' initiative, drawing 
inspiration from Singapore. He mandated that 
one member from each household join the 
Tigers, instructing all district commanders of 
the LTTE in the North and East of Sri Lanka 
to enforce this policy. This was an attempt 
to mirror Singapore's compulsory military 
training. The commanders and fighters in the 
East, known for their unwavering loyalty to 
Leader Prabhakaran, readily complied with his 
orders, even when it involved challenging tasks 
such as forced recruitment.
Forced recruitment was a reality in the 
Eastern Province, and I must acknowledge 
my responsibility in this matter. It is, however, 
crucial to recognize that a significant number of 
individuals from the East joined the movement 
voluntarily. The results of this initiative were 
mixed—approximately 50% successful and 
50% unsuccessful. While many mothers were 
opposed to this practice, there were also those 
who willingly permitted their children to enlist. 
The forced recruitment that took place during 
my tenure as a commander is an undeniable 
fact. Another incontestable truth is that it was 
carried out under the directives of Prabhakaran 
and was not solely initiated and implemented 
by Karuna Amman. Prabhakaran's control 
over the organization was so absolute 
that no action could transpire without his 
awareness. He wielded his authority over the 
Tiger organization with an iron fist. We, the 
commanders and members, were essentially 
executors of his commands. 
During this time, the influx of youths joining 
the LTTE from the North diminished, as many 
parents chose to send their children abroad 
for safety. As a result, many recruits from 
Eastern regions like Batticaloa, Ampara, and 
Trincomalee joined the Tigers. These Eastern 
fighters, often engaged in battles in the North, 
primarily believed they were fighting to protect

leader Prabhakaran. In fact, our Eastern fighters 
played a crucial role in saving Prabhakaran's 
life on several occasions, starting with the 1989 
Operation Checkmate by the Indian forces. 
Therefore, when I decided to leave the LTTE, I 
was faced with a crucial decision regarding my 
fighters. I ordered the Eastern fighters under my 
command to disarm and return to their homes 
to avoid a devastating conflict with the Vanni 
Tigers. This decision was taken to prevent a 
fratricidal conflict. As a result, approximately 
6,000 Eastern fighters were spared from further 
violence and sent home. My primary goal was 
to avoid a bloody confrontation with the Vanni 
Tigers. Thankfully, this decision allowed these 
young individuals to reunite with their families 
and remain alive.
Additionally, I must acknowledge a painful 
part of our history. After the departure of 
the Indian Peace Keeping Force, the LTTE 
was responsible for the ruthless elimination 
of around 8,000 members of other militant 
groups in a fratricidal massacre. This event has 
left me with a deep sense of agony and guilt. To 
prevent further fratricide, I made the decision 
to send my fighters home.
Do you now regret the forced 
recruitment? If you hadn't engaged in 
recruitment, those young people might 
still be alive, right?
Honestly, I do harbor regrets about my actions, 
even though they were executed on the 
commands of Prabhakaran.
However, it's crucial to note that there were no 
major battles following the forced recruitment 
of fighters from the East. The split within the 
Liberation Tigers organization occurred in 
2004, at a time when these recruits were still in

![p030_i1.jpg](images_out/009_who_is_the_traitor/p030_i1.jpg)

31
training. As a result, the majority of the Eastern 
fighters who were conscripted did not engage 
in active combat. This, fortunately, meant that 
their lives were ultimately spared from the 
violence of war.
Nevertheless, it's important to acknowledge 
that thousands of Eastern fighters lost their 
lives in earlier battles in the North, such as 
the Jayasikurui operation, the attack on the 
Pooneryn camp, and the battle of Elephant 
Pass. It is noteworthy, however, that most of 
these fighters had joined the organization of 
their own volition. 
Even in my capacity as the commander of the 
East, I maintain the belief that when a liberation 
movement like the LTTE resorts to forced 
recruitment, it is a harbinger of impending 
failure. Such actions signal diminishing support 
from the people for the cause. Despite holding 
this conviction, I adhered to the orders of my 
leader, Prabhakaran, in matters of recruitment. 
Initially, young individuals like myself joined 
the struggle willingly. Joining the Tigers was a 
challenging process at that time; candidates were 
selected only after several trials. Subsequently, 
we launched intensive campaigns to recruit 
more people into the organization. However, 
this eventually led to forced recruitment. 
The forced recruitment that occurred in 
Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu during the final 
battle represented a significant betrayal by the 
Tigers and their leader, Prabhakaran, to their 
own people. 
To be continued.

A
s Nuwan Thushara's late-swinging slingshots shattered the 
stumps of Bangladeshi batters, making the ball behave as if 
it were tied to his hands by an unseen string, it was déjà vu for 
Sri Lankan fans. Is Sri Lankan cricket on its route to revival? Is it 
myth or reality? One might wonder. This is a dilemma we have 
faced many times before, only to end up disappointed. 
It wasn't an uncommon sight to see a man with a similar action 
dismantling opponents with unconventional terror arising from 
sheer unorthodoxy. But more than the 'we've been here and seen 
this before' feeling, it showcased Sri Lanka's immense depth in 
bowling. I dare say that at no point in our history have we had 
such variety and depth in our bowling department. It's a serious 
statement, considering we were blessed to witness Vaas, Murali, 
and Malinga playing together in the past.
The very opportunity to make such a statement seems 
paradoxical, considering our current state of affairs in T20Is. 
However, with two consecutive wins against Afghanistan and 
Bangladesh, it's inevitable that thoughts of a strong showing in 
the upcoming WT20 will begin to sprout in the minds of fans.

Then where do we stand, and what can 
we hope for? 
Let us be realistic. On paper, we have a 
bowling attack, which is on par with any. 
Chameera, when fit and firing, is a dream. 
Madushanka has shown what he can do barely 
a few months before at the ODI World Cup. 
Theekshana and Wanindu have demonstrated 
their worth and past their honeymoon periods. 
Yet the combination of a mystery spinner who 
can bowl in powerplays and stem the run flow 
at the death together with a gun leg-spinning 
all-rounder is a gift any team would pay any 
fortune to acquire in a T20 side. The above 
alone is filthy rich on paper. It doesn't end 
there. 
Add to that two slingers from the Malinga 
School of Bowling. Pathirana and Thushara 
can be darlings and demons on alternate days. 
The pendulum can swing in your favour or the 
other way in extremely ecstatic and frustrating 
ways. Yet possessing these to modern artilleries 
is a blessing beyond imagination. 
A fit Mathews, with his skill and experience, 
has the potential to catch opponents off-
guard in powerplays. The Sri Lankan bowling 
lineup looks supreme on paper, but 'on paper' 
is the key phrase. What really matters is 
what transpires on the field. This is largely 
determined by fitness and the ability to convert 
potential into performance. It's unpredictable 
whether all these individuals can synchronize 
to create a synergy that resonates like a 
symphony in the hopeful hearts of Sri Lankan 
fans. However, considering where we were just 
a few years ago, the mere luxury of hoping for 
such magic is a blessing for any fan.

How these players will emerge post-IPL, 
especially in regards to fitness and match 
readiness, will be extremely important. There is 
a high chance that Pathirana and Theekshana 
will be exposed in this year's IPL, as teams will 
know that getting the better of them is key to 
succeeding against CSK. This will impact Sri 
Lanka's campaign. Surely, there will be a few 
frustrating injuries and loss of form. Yet, the 
pipeline is so strong that we should be able to 
overcome these issues and field a potent attack. 
A potent attack – that's the key, the ultimate 
game changer in T20s. It's worth remembering 
that potent bowling attacks were crucial to Sri 
Lanka's early dominance in the T20I era. This 
lineup, surely on paper, has the potential to 
match their predecessors. The million-dollar 
question is whether they will be fit and smart 
enough. That remains to be answered.
While the bowling equity seems well funded, 
the batting cannot boast of the same. However,

![p034_i1.jpg](images_out/009_who_is_the_traitor/p034_i1.jpg)

Jaffna Monitor

the encouraging facet is an 
almost settled lineup with 
few batters contributing 
consistently. While none 
of them are on par with 
the global T20 standards, 
as reflected by the non-
selection of any, even 
in IPL squads, they can 
derive inspiration from 
the past. In 2014, merely 
months before the World 
T20 triumph, the likes of 
Sangakkara, Mahela and 
Dilshan formed the core 
of Sri Lanka's batting. 
While many reasons were 
attributed, the simple fact 
was that IPL dynamics 
filter those who fall 
behind the pace at which 
the game is evolving, and 
selection and auction 
prices, more often than 
not, indicate the T20 
worthiness. They found a way to execute a 
winning campaign, playing to their strengths 
despite lagging behind. The current lineup up 
too should strive for the same. 
Nissanka's newfound aggressive approach, 
Mendis's composure and consistency, Sadeera's 
stability and Kamindu's assuredness, together 
with Asalanka's adaptability, can surely help Sri 
Lanka put decent scores, which would give the 
bowling attack a chance to leverage in favour 
of the team. They may not have the experience 
of their predecessors but surely they have the 
necessary skills to put on a decent show. 
Overall, these two series wins shouldn't mean 
much, considering Sri Lanka's past legacy. 
But the present is different. Despite having 
a team that looks good on paper, there are 
shortcomings that could be exposed by better 
teams. However, these wins suggest that Sri 
Lanka is well on its way to becoming a better 
team among the lower-tier teams. That's a 
good starting point. There is a sense of clarity, 
newfound freedom, and accountability. The 
signs are promising. A semi-final berth would 
be a jackpot. But a strong run towards a semi-
final berth, achieving at least a 5th or 6th 
position finish, would be a good deal given the 
current context.
Is Sri Lanka's resurgence a myth or reality? No 
one would know. However, given the talent 
pool and the latest developments, one cannot 
be found at fault for assuming or at least 
hoping that it's not a myth but a reality in the 
making.
