A Symphony 
	 	 	 	
of Solace

ot only has language ceased to be a barrier 
to enjoying beautiful music, but I've also 
realized that a lack of musical knowledge isn't 
a hindrance either. Although I've never sought 
refuge in a music class, even during the rain, 
I now find myself mesmerized by music for 
extended periods. My hands clap to the rhythm 
instinctively, without any conscious direction 
from my brain. At times, I even lose track of 
hunger. Hymns, once monotonous and grating 
to me when accompanied by only one or two 
instruments, now fully captivate me. I feel as 
though I'm journeying through an uncharted 
land, bewitched by the performance's beauty. 
During festival times in Nallur, the sight of 
people seated simply on the sandy ground, 
engrossed in expert Carnatic concerts, used 
to seem like a voyage to a foreign world to me. 
I now regret having felt that way years ago. 
This transformation began after I accidentally 
stumbled upon a performance by Deepika 
Varadarajan on YouTube's QFR program last 
year. Although she performed only a few songs, 
my subsequent searches about her opened a 
gateway to a vast realm of traditional music.
It has now become a routine for me to watch and 
relish a song or two in the afternoon or before 
bedtime. What distinguishes her from other 
musicians is her ability to perform any song, in 
any language, with unwavering devotion and 
seemingly effortless elegance. Her music flows 
softly like a stream, then swells like a mighty 
river, and finally cascades down like a waterfall 
from a mountain peak. Throughout her music's 
dynamic and multidimensional journey, her 
divine, radiant smile is a constant presence 
from the beginning to the end of each song. 
Observing her maintain this continuous smile 
is a rarity I have not seen in any other artist.
As Kalki's music reviews suggest, the essential 
qualities of a singer are a 'sweet voice, extensive 
music

musical knowledge, and expressive capability.' 
From my modest but expanding understanding 
of music, Deepika clearly possesses these 
qualities in abundance. Her artistry seamlessly 
fuses these elements, creating an absorbing 
and emotional experience for the audience. 
Her performances, marked by both technical 
expertise and deep emotional expression, 
establish her as an artist of extraordinary 
caliber. Her divine voice masterfully guides 
each song, while her captivating presence 
ensures that the audience's eyes and hearts are 
firmly fixed, making the journey through her 
songs a delightful escapade.
Typically, one doesn't start listening to Deepika's 
songs with the intention of stopping after just 
one; it invariably turns into an extended session. 
Yet, no matter the length, her music leaves you 
feeling light and uplifted, as if floating in the air. 
Despite her notable career in the film industry, 
her musical contributions there are scant, 
which leaves her admirers longing for more of 
her captivating voice, a pillar of Tamil music.
For over a decade, during my regular medical 
check-ups in Bangkok, I have been consistently 
prescribed migraine medication. The end of 
the war in Eelam and witnessing the conditions 
at the 'Manik Farm' camp, where the surviving 
Vanni people were treated inhumanely, has 
been deeply distressing. Consequently, severe 
migraines have become a persistent part of my 
life. However, six months ago, during a visit to 
my doctor, I declined the migraine medication, 
prompting a look of surprise from him. Indeed, 
ever since I started listening to Deepika's songs 
daily, those once essential pills have become 
redundant. 
Keep singing, the luminous star of music.

Beyond Shanthan: Honoring 
the Many Faces of the LTTE
S
upporters of the LTTE, who previously claimed that Shanthan, 
arrested in 1991 and convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination 
case, had no involvement with the LTTE, have recently written 
extensively about his involvement with the organization and its 
operations following his death. They now acknowledge that he was 
a LTTE member and buried him in the Ellankulam Thuyilum Illam 
(resting place) or Ellankulam Martyrs' Cemetery of the LTTE. 
Shanthan's younger brother, Mathisutha, went a step further by 
detailing the services Shanthan rendered to the LTTE. He outlined 
Shanthan's involvement, noting that during his high school days 
at Uduppidy American Mission in 1988, Shanthan planned several 
attacks against the Indian army. These attacks were carried out with 
other LTTE members: Salam, David, Gobu, Arjuna, Raghuvaran, and 
Neelan. It is noted that Raghuvaran, also called 'one-eyed Sivarasan', 
was the mastermind behind the Padmanabha and Rajiv Gandhi

associations, while David was the assassin in 
the Padmanabha case. This clearly indicates 
the connection Shanthan has with these two 
high-profile assassinations.
 Mathisutha also noted that after finishing 
his high school exams, Shanthan served as 
a direct combatant in the war and travelled 
to India by boat for higher studies in 
commerce, living near the EPRLF office in 
Chennai. He wrote that, in relation to the 
Padmanabha assassination case, the Supreme 
Court sentenced Santhan to nine years in 
prison. Upon his return to Sri Lanka, he was 
appointed responsible for the entire island and 
operated under the name 'Thinesh.' 
He also mentioned that Pottu Amman never 
missed eating at his mother's house whenever 
he was in Mallavi, indicating a close familial 
relationship between Shanthan's family and the 
LTTE. Therefore, his burial in the Ellankulam 
martyr's resting place is viewed as appropriate 
by all LTTE supporters. I have no opposing 
view on Shanthan being commemorated by 
LTTE supporters.
However, my question remains: Do we 
remember all the LTTE fighters? The answer is 
no. Anyone with an iota of conscience would 
acknowledge that we don't remember all 
the LTTE fighters who took up arms for the 
liberation of Sri Lankan Tamils. 
I am haunted by memories of Tamil Nadu 
youths who, driven by the plight of our own 
Sri Lankan Tamils, joined the LTTE to fight 
against the Sinhalese government. This still 
bleeds my heart and gives me nightmares. 
During the peak of the Eelam struggle, 
numerous Tamil youths from Tamil Nadu, 
fueled by ethnic solidarity, volunteered to fight 
for Tamil Eelam. The LTTE ferried them here 
by boat, provided arms training, and integrated 
them into the organization. I personally knew 
a few youths from Tamil Nadu who joined the 
LTTE; I met them in the Vanni jungle. They 
were genuine warriors, motivated solely by 
their profound love for the Sri Lankan Tamils. 
While we, Sri Lankan Tamils, had the duty to 
fight for our people, these Tamil Nadu youths 
were driven purely by their deep affection for 
us. 
Tragically, Pottu Amman, the intelligence chief 
of the LTTE, harboured suspicions that some 
of the passionate youths from Tamil Nadu were 
infiltrated by RAW (The Research and Analysis 
Wing, India's foreign intelligence agency). 
Following directives from Prabhakaran and 
Pottu Amman, a heartbreaking fate befell the 
majority of these fighters. Despite the lack 
of solid evidence of their alleged association 
with RAW, these young individuals, who had 
selflessly journeyed to aid our cause, were 
ruthlessly executed by the LTTE. 
During my time with the LTTE and its 
intelligence wing, I witnessed Pottu Amman's 
inability to produce even a shred of proof 
against these innocent youths from Tamil 
Nadu. Even high-ranking LTTE leaders, 
in confidential conversations with me, 
condemned this savage act of fratricide 
orchestrated by Pottu Amman under 
Prabhakaran's orders. Yet, they remained 
publicly silent, paralyzed by the fear of 
repercussions. 
The memories of these young fighters still 
torment me, robbing me of sleep. How could 
a freedom organization eliminate scores of 
youths merely on the basis of suspicion or 
paranoia? How can we possibly justify such 
actions? If we do, we are neither a freedom 
movement nor even human. Are these Tamil 
Nadu youths, I estimate around hundreds, 
remembered? The answer is tragically no.

Have we ever acknowledged these innocent 
souls who journeyed all the way from India to 
fight alongside us? We've even concealed the 
truth from their families. Just as Shanthan's 
mother yearned and agonized for her child, 
the mothers of these Indian youths must have 
endured similar suffering. Shanthan's mother's 
love for her son, her longing for his return, 
and her desire to feed him even a single morsel 
of rice with her hands is heartbreakingly 
understandable. But doesn't this tragedy also 
apply to the mothers of the Indian youths? 
Do we remember the Muslim fighters of the 
LTTE, who were killed due to the leadership's 
paranoia? In the 1980s, a large number of 
Muslim youths, numbering in the hundreds, 
joined the LTTE, driven by their thirst for a 
sovereign Tamil land. However, when relations 
between Tamils and Muslims deteriorated 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the LTTE 
leadership mercilessly killed hundreds of its 
own Muslim guards, suspecting them of being 
agents of Sri Lankan intelligence. I personally 
knew a few of these Muslim youths. It still 
breaks my heart to know that some of them 
were killed in such cunning ways. They were 
summoned to a battlefield and then shot dead 
from behind. I prefer not to elaborate further.
Do we remember our covert black tigers 
(kiwKf fUk;Gypfs;) publicly? Pottu 
Amman once told me that there were around 
300 covert black tigers. These black tigers 
conducted massive operations. The first attack 
by the covert black tigers occurred on March 
2, 1991, in Colombo on Havelock Road, killing 
Ranjan Wijeratne, the then ruthless Minister of 
Defence, involving a car bomb. 
The LTTE's intelligence wing's Colombo 
head, Charles, masterminded the attack. The 
individual who carried out this first concealed 
Tiger operation was Prem, who initially 
worked as a driver for Dominic, the then-
political head of the Jaffna district. Later, Prem 
was inducted into the intelligence unit and 
subsequently into the covert black tigers, a 
special unit within the intelligence wing. I met 
Prem a few times and talked with him also. He 
had a round face and a great, inviting smile. He 
was a good driver, too.
The members of this specialized unit were

not publicly acknowledged. Instead, their 
commemoration occurred privately, primarily 
on August 19, the anniversary of Sivarasan's 
death. These confidential memorials, often led 
by Pottu Amman, serve as a notable indication 
of the LTTE's involvement in the assassination 
of Rajiv Gandhi. The observances were 
characteristically discreet. I attended a few 
of these memorial functions, where I learned 
about the covert Black Tigers. However, this 
memorial event is very private, to the extent 
that even most members within the LTTE 
ranks were unaware of it. The LTTE never 
made these memorials public. 
However, a few former LTTE leaders who 
escaped the war are likely aware of these 
undercover operatives. What stops them from 
publicly honouring these individuals, though?
It's important to note that not all operations 
by the covert Black Tigers were driven by a 
broader mission. In some cases, these attacks, 
orchestrated by the LTTE, even targeted Tamil 
civilians—the very community they claimed to 
represent. A notable example occurred on May 
15, 2009, just days before the LTTE's complete 
military defeat. That evening, between 5 and 
5:30 PM, the LTTE carried out what would 
be their last suicide attack. It was executed by 
a covert Black Tiger operative named Anpu. 
I had met Anpu several times at the LTTE's 
training base, strategically located in a small 
forest near the edge of the Iranamadu Tank in 
Vattakachi. 
The attack resulted in the majority of casualties 
being Tamil civilians, not members of the 
Sri Lankan army. I wasn't at the attack site, 
but by a tragic twist of fate, I found myself 
where the attack was commanded – at the 
Undiyal Pillayar Kovil Panakudal (cz;bay; 
gps;isahu; gdq;$ly;) in Mullivaikkal. I 
took refuge at the back of the temple in a small 
bunker. 
You should also bear in mind that at the 
time of this incident, the territory of Tamil

Eelam, which the LTTE had been fighting for, 
had shrunk to less than 4 square kilometres. 
In such a situation, it was evident to any 
reasonable observer that the LTTE could not 
recover from this significant military setback 
and was on the brink of comprehensive defeat. 
Despite this, the LTTE still orchestrated that 
massive suicide attack. 
Inside our bunker, key figures from the 
Black Tigers, including Premanath Master, a 
notorious figure within the LTTE, and Anpu 
Master, arrived to deliver orders for a lethal 
suicide mission. Earlier, the LTTE had salvaged 
a 500 kg bomb, which had been dropped by 
the Sri Lankan Air Force but failed to explode. 
They repurposed this bomb for the suicide 
attack, placing it in a Mitsubishi pickup truck.
The initial strategy was to launch the attack 
when the army was within reach. However, 
by May 15, 2009, the LTTE's area of control 
had drastically reduced. Despite this and the 
presence of hundreds of their own civilians, 
they decided to proceed with the suicide 
mission. I was in the bunker when Premanath 
Master and Anpu Master issued the final 
command to the suicide bomber, also named 
Anpu, through a walkie-talkie.
Listening in, I overheard Anpu report that he 
was on his way, but his view was obstructed 
by a large screen set up by the army to conceal 
its side activities. He mentioned seeing no 
military personnel, only Tamil civilians. 
From the tone of his voice, it was clear he was 
reluctant to carry out the suicide mission, fully 
aware that it would lead to the loss of hundreds 
of lives from his own Tamil community. 
Despite his apparent reluctance, hesitation, 
and pleas, Premanath Master coldly instructed 
him to continue, dismissing concerns about 
civilian casualties with the command 'rdj;ij 
gw;wp Nahrpf;fhk mb' (hit the target without 
thinking about the people). Anpu Master 
further spurred him on, motivating him to 
proceed with the brutal suicide attack by 
reminding him to recite the motto, 'Gypfspd; 
jhfk; jkpoPo jhafk;' (The thirst of the 
Tiger is the Nation of Tamil Eelam), when he 
detonated the bomb. Shortly after, a massive 
explosion reverberated. Anpu had triggered 
the 500 kg bomb, killing himself and, as I 
estimate, around 300 Tamil civilians in this 
horrific act of war crime by the LTTE.

J. Kumar Babu, a pseudonym chosen

based on his narration to our reporter 
from the Jaffna Monitor.
Later, I purposefully met with a sniper from 
the LTTE, who was assigned to clear the path 
for the vehicle. He was stationed near the large 
screen set up by the army to conceal their 
activities. He informed me that the Sri Lankan 
army was actually far from the screen, dealing 
with the Tamil civilians through loudspeakers 
and keeping them in large numbers along 
the road, waiting to be searched and allowed 
passage one by one. He revealed that no army 
personnel were near the site of the attack, and 
as a result, the casualties were predominantly 
Tamil civilians, with only a few army personnel 
harmed. 
Are we remembering these innocent Tamils 
who perished in this brutal act of war crime by 
the LTTE? Or are we recalling the covert LTTE 
Black Tiger suicide bomber, where the bomber 
detonated the device against his will and with 
apparent hesitation? We are not, are we?
Before this attack, the LTTE executed a 
merciless suicide bombing targeting its own 
civilians on February 9, 2009. A female LTTE 
suicide bomber detonated herself near an 
Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) centre in 
the Vishwamadu area of Tharmapuram. This 
attack led to a significant number of civilian 
casualties, along with a few army personnel. 
In the days leading up to this attack, 
approximately 8,000 Tamil civilians had 
relocated from LTTE-controlled territories 
to areas under army control. People were 
in a state of profound distress; they lacked 
food, proper sanitation facilities, and running 
water. The Sri Lankan army conducted heavy 
shellings over every inch of the land controlled 
by the LTTE, prompting people to move to 
areas under army control. The army welcomed 
them, providing adequate food and facilities, 
which was highly reassuring. This strategy 
aimed to treat the civilians well, thereby 
encouraging more Tamil people to defect. In 
an attempt to stop this migration of Tamils to 
the army side, the LTTE resorted to a brutal 
suicide attack.
A leader from the LTTE's intelligence wing, 
Thuronar, acting on orders from Pottu 
Amman, 
dispatched a 
female Black 
Tiger to carry 
out a bombing 
at a checkpoint. 
This attack 
resulted in 
high civilian 
and military 
casualties. 
Subsequently, 
the army's 
approach towards Sri Lankan Tamils 
underwent significant changes. Becoming 
highly suspicious of those surrendering, the 
army, after this attack, demanded individuals 
to surrender fully unclothed, a measure that 
was deeply humiliating.
Commemorate Shanthan and make him a 
hero; I have no issue with that. But at least, 
possess a sliver of conscience to remember 
every LTTE fighter who took up arms to fight 
for our own Tamils. And remember all the 
Tamil civilians killed directly by the LTTE, 
labelled as traitors or caught in the LTTE's 
cruel, ruthless missions on their side. 
Thuronar
