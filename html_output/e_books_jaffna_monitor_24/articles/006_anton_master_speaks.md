Former Military Office Chief 
of LTTE Shares His Untold 
Story with 'Jaffna Monitor'

As a prominent member of the LTTE who 
oversaw the organization's Military Office 
(MO), what prompted your decision to leave the 
LTTE? Could you share the reasons behind this 
significant move?
You need to understand one fundamental aspect: we 
initiated the liberation struggle in response to the Sri Lankan 
Tamil people's treatment as second-class citizens by Sinhala 
chauvinist governments. The LTTE was not established, 
nor did its fighters sacrifice their lives to combat the Indian 
government or its army. I firmly believed that antagonizing 
India was not a viable strategy, and I also understood that 
Sri Lankan Tamils could not achieve their goals by making 
India an enemy. Unfortunately, this understanding was 
something Prabhakaran lacked.
When Prabhakaran himself lacked this clarity, it was 
unrealistic to expect his close aides, who always concurred 
with him and acted as 'yes-men,' to possess it. Opposing 
India would have left the LTTE without a safe haven, so I

KT Sivakumar, also known as 
Anton Master, is a prominent 
early member of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) 
and a close associate of leader 
Prabhakaran. He significantly 
contributed to the LTTE 
as a member of its Central 
Committee and as the founder 
and head of the Military Office 
(MO), enhancing the group's 
military effectiveness. Known 
for his reticence in media 
interactions, Sivakumar prefers 
'dialogues' over interviews. 
The following is a part of a 
series of dialogues I had with 
him, providing rare insights, 
which will be featured in the 
forthcoming issues.

Anton Master (L) with Prabhakaran
firmly believed that we should not antagonize 
India. 
During clashes between the LTTE and the 
Indian Army in Jaffna, we even transported 
injured LTTE fighters to India for treatment 
with the blessing of the Indian government. 
This demonstrated the Indian government's 
remarkable tolerance at the time. While fighting 
was going on between LTTE and Indian forces 
in Sri Lanka, I met actor Sivaji Ganesan, who 
led the political party 'Thamizhaga Munnetra 
Munnani'. I asked him to release a press 
statement in favor of the LTTE. He responded 
with a sad smile, questioning how he could 
support us while we were killing our soldiers. 
Nevertheless, he agreed to release the statement 
as I had requested.
I was not alone in this view; even Kittu shared 
my belief that we should not confront India. 
At that time, after sustaining injuries from a 
grenade attack in Jaffna, Kittu was in India, 
managing the LTTE's propaganda activities. I 
also spoke to Bala Anna ( Anton Balasingam), 
who had been staying in Bangalore on a low 
profile and planning to escape to London. He 
also accepted my position.
It was against this backdrop that in 1988, at 
the suggestion of the Indian government, the 
LTTE engaged in negotiations with India's 
foreign intelligence agency, the Research and 
Analysis Wing (RAW). Kittu and I represented 
the LTTE in these discussions in Chennai. The 
Indian government consented to several of our 
demands, including establishing an interim 
government and inaugurating a police academy 
in the North and East. In my opinion, This was 
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Tamils and 
LTTE to steer towards a Federal state or separate 
state with more lifesaving and fewer casualties. 
All we would have needed was patience.

Due to the history of Sri Lanka, psychologically, 
India is perceived as a threat and an adversary 
by Sinhalese regimes. No Sinhalese leaders 
were content or in agreement with the Indo-Sri 
Lanka Accord and India's direct involvement; 
it was akin to a forced marriage. This situation 
could have been a significant trump card for the 
Tamils following the implementation of the 13th 
Amendment. However, Prabhakaran muddled 
the plan over a single issue â€“ the participation 
of a Sri Lankan government representative in 
the interim government. This greatly frustrated 
me. 
I sent a message to Prabhakaran questioning 
why he opposed the Interim Government 
over a minor issue and the political purpose of 
continuing the war with India etc. I mentioned 
that if there is no reasonable answer, I will not 
contribute any more to the LTTE. His response 
was dismissive, accusing me of displaying my 
'true Vellalar caste behavior' and suggesting 
that if I feared confronting the Indian Army, I 
should leave the organization. 
I then departed from the LTTE with a heavy 
heart, realizing that Prabhakaran's foolishness 
and utter stubbornness would lead to 
unimaginable tragedies for Sri Lankan Tamils. 
At that point, I completely disengaged myself 
from the armed struggle. 
I must clarify that I never accused Prabhakaran 
of being casteist or discriminating based on 
caste. I did not perceive him as holding any 
animosity towards the Vellala caste. I believe 
that my letter, which challenged his decisions, 
provoked his anger, resulting in his harsh 
response. 
The Prabhakaran I knew did not show 
preferences or aversions based on religion. 
Although a Saivite, he treated individuals of 
other faiths without discrimination. I was 
profoundly shocked when the LTTE expelled 
Muslims from Jaffna in 1990, as this action 
contradicted the Prabhakaran I knew, who 
transcended caste and religious prejudices. In 
this respect, I can affirm that he possessed the 
qualities of a true gentleman.
During the period between the first and 
second Thimphu peace talks in 1985, an 
informal discussion took place, attended by 
representatives of various militant groups, 
including EPRLF's Padmanabha, TELO's Sri 
From left to right - Appapillai Amirthalingam, then Leader of the TULF; Anton Master, former Military Office Chief of the 
LTTE; and Murugesu Sivasithamparam, Member of Parliament from TULF.

Sabaratnam, and EROS's Ratnasabapathi. 
Prabhakaran, Balasingam, Thilakar, and I were 
present to represent the LTTE. At this meeting, 
while everyone was sitting at the round table, 
Ratnasabapathi walked from his chair, held 
Prabhakaran's both shoulders, and said, 'He 
is a Karaiyan,' alluding to his Karaiyar caste. 
Prabhakaran, however, showed no signs of 
resentment or anger; he merely smiled and 
continued engaging in the conversation. This 
incident reinforced my belief that caste and 
religious prejudices did not sway him. 
Prominent LTTE figures such as Kapil 
Amman and Mathavan Master, who 
ascended to key roles, were initially 
under your guidance in the Military 
Office (MO). Could you elaborate 
on your methods for identifying 
and cultivating talent within the 
organization?
I am trying to remember who Kapil Amman 
was and in which division he worked. Mathavan 
was a gentle, joyful, and dedicated man. In 
MO, everyone was given equal opportunity 
and treated fairly. I did not act as if I were 
in command. People working at MO were 
hardworking and dedicated. We held board 
meetings to discuss and approve matters. That 
was not a common practice within the LTTE. 
Presently, certain ultra-Tamil 
nationalist parties appear to mirror 
Prabhakaran's ideology and methods. 
How do you perceive the perpetuation 
of his legacy in the current political 
climate? Do you believe this approach 
benefits the Sri Lankan Tamil 
community?
History serves as a classroom where the wise 
learn not to repeat mistakes. We all should draw 
lessons from the errors of Prabhakaran, who 
was undoubtedly a real and dedicated fighter. 
It is unwise to repeat the mistakes he and the 
LTTE made. 
There is no easy, straight path to freedom, 
whether the chosen vehicle is democracy or 
armed struggle. There will be steps to cross and 
steps to sit on along the way. Beggars have no 
choice; no one heeds the voice of beggars. The 
way to success is to gather strength, power, and 
resources, increase self-sufficiency in every way, 
and consolidate and reorganize at each step 
before moving on to the next step.
The most destructive and counterproductive 
action occurs when those who believe in armed 
struggle interfere with those who have chosen 
democratic methods to assert their rights.
Tamils must engage with the Sinhalese to 
foster mutual understanding between the 
communities. Sincere and continuous dialogue 
between these groups can significantly hasten 
the journey toward a solution.
To be continued...

directed by the legendary K Balachander.
This interview marks the start of a series that highlights the 
stories of professionals designed to motivate our youth. We 
explore Deepika Varatharajan's career, providing insights into 
her musical journey. We plan to publish this series of interviews 
monthly.
How were you introduced to the world of music?
My introduction to the musical world began at home, thanks 
to my mother, Geetha Varatharajan, a trained Carnatic 
Music singer who has worked with the renowned music 
composer Ilayaraja. Her dedication to Carnatic Music 
was a constant presence in our home. Similarly, my 
father, Varadarajan, is a fervent music enthusiast, and 
his side of the family has always had a deep appreciation 
for music. From my early childhood, music has been an 
ever-present element in our household. I grew up watching my 
mother practice Carnatic Music daily, which naturally piqued 
my interest in learning it. It felt almost instinctive to start 
learning the basics of Carnatic Music from my mother right at 
home.
As I progressed in my musical training, I underwent formal 
instruction under the guidance of Vittal Ramamurthy, 
followed by lessons from O.S. Thyagarajan, Vijayaraghavan, 
and Vairamangalam Lakshmi Narayanan. Upon reaching 
an advanced stage in Carnatic music, I had the privilege of 
becoming a disciple of Sudha Ragunathan. I spent many years 
under her tutelage, which greatly deepened my understanding 
and honed my skills in Carnatic Music. For the past 10 years, I 
have been learning Hindustani Classical music from Sri Prasad 
Khaparde. 
With the advancement of technology, is the 
traditional Guru-shishya method still necessary 
for learning Indian Classical music from a guru, 
or can newcomers learn it through different 
means?
I believe there's no real substitute for learning Carnatic Music 
from a guru in person. Advanced technologies can certainly 
offer support, but they cannot take the place of a guru's role.

Originating from the Vedas, Indian Classical 
Music has been passed down through oral 
tradition for centuries. These new technologies 
are best used as supplemental aids. For example, 
over the past 10 years, I've been learning 
Hindustani music from Prasad Khaparde, a 
senior disciple of Ustad Rashid Khan, who is 
based in Nashik, Maharashtra. I make it a point 
to attend his classes in person as much as I can, 
but when that's not possible, I continue my 
lessons through Skype. This technology serves 
as a helpful aid, but I firmly believe that I could 
not have comprehensively learned Hindustani 
music merely by watching videos of my guru 
on YouTube.
You are well-versed in both Carnatic 
and Hindustani music. Could 
you discuss the similarities and 
differences between the two styles? 
And do you have a preference for 
one over the other?
It's difficult for me to choose a favourite 
between the two, as I deeply love both forms of 
classical music. In my view, the fundamentals 
of both Carnatic and Hindustani music are 
quite similar. They share the same notes, and 
there are common ragas in both traditions. 
Moreover, each has adopted a few ragas from 
the other. However, despite these similarities, 
there are distinct differences as well. Carnatic 
music performances are primarily composition-
based, and we do a lot of improvisation. 
In a Hindustani classical music concert, for 
example, we say we are performing Raag 
Yaman, wherein we include two or three 
bandishes (short composition) and focus 
fully on improvisation. Each style has unique 
characteristics and beauty, making them 
equally appealing to me.
Managing language barriers must 
be challenging, especially since 
you can't speak all the languages 
associated with Carnatic and 
Hindustani music. How do you 
overcome this challenge?
Carnatic 
music 
predominantly 
features 
compositions in Telugu, but it also encompasses 
songs in Tamil, Kannada, and Sanskrit. 
Conversely, Hindustani music is deeply 
rooted in the Braj language, a dialect of Hindi. 
This genre not only includes region-specific 
songs, like those in Marathi or Bengali, but its 
compositions are also extensively influenced 
by Urdu. Furthermore, I have learned to 
speak Hindi to deepen my understanding and 
enhance my performance of Hindustani music. 
When it comes to singing regional languages 
like, say, Marathi or Bengali, which have their 
own unique accents, I seek help from native

speakers. Fortunately, I learned Sanskrit 
from my childhood and even completed my 
bachelor's degree in it. My proficiency in 
reading and writing Sanskrit is quite high. 
Tamil is my mother tongue, and I'm also fluent 
in English. My Sanskrit knowledge has been 
immensely helpful. When I need to learn a 
song in a language other than Tamil, I prefer to 
write it down in the Devanagari script, which 
is used in Sanskrit. This approach has greatly 
aided my pronunciation, ensuring it never 
goes astray. Additionally, I've learned to write 
and speak Hindi. When it comes to singing in 
Bengali, which has its own unique nuances, I 
seek help from native speakers.
Having sung for nearly all the 
major music composers in the 
South Indian film industry, do you 
have a favourite song that you've 
performed?
Yes, over the years, I have had the privilege 
of singing for almost all the renowned music 
composers in the South Indian film industry, 
starting from my childhood. My favourite 
song is 'Irul Konda Vaanil' from the movie 
'Baahubali.'
 What advice would you offer to a 
young person from Jaffna aspiring 
to become a great musician like 
yourself?
The first step is to find a good teacher, regardless 
of the type of music you wish to learn. Engaging 
in continuous practice is crucial; there are 
no shortcuts in music, and it's certainly not 
a cakewalk. One must practice diligently 
and with unwavering determination. Also, 
immense patience is necessary. Learning music 
is fundamentally different from acquiring 
other degrees. In music, there is no definitive 
endpoint â€“ it offers a lifetime of learning 
opportunities. To understand all the nuances 
of a single raga can take more than a lifetime. 
So, to all newcomers, my advice is to remain 
patient and keep practising.
Have you visited Sri Lanka and 
Jaffna?
Yes, I had the opportunity to visit this beautiful 
country once in 2010. I came along with the 
renowned dancer Alarmel Valli. We spent only 
two days in Jaffna, but even in that short time, I 
was mesmerized by the rich culture and beauty 
of the place. And, of course, the warmth and 
hospitality of the people of Jaffna left a lasting 
impression on me.
With tourism flourishing in Sri 
Lanka and an increasing number of 
tourists from India visiting, do you 
have plans to visit Sri Lanka again 
anytime soon?
I would love to revisit. I have been longing 
to return to Sri Lanka, a country of immense 
beauty. Many of my close friends have recently 
travelled there, and their experiences have 
further fueled my desire to visit. I hope I can 
make the trip soon.
