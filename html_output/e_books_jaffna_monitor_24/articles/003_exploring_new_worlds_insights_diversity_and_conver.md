Greetings,
We're delighted to share that the latest issue of the Jaffna Monitor has 
created quite a stir! The overwhelming influx of emails and calls from our 
global readership has been both astounding and uplifting. We extend our 
sincere gratitude to each of you for your enthusiastic reception of our work.
This edition heralds the beginning of an exciting new series offering an 
intimate glimpse into the lives of distinguished individuals from India and 
beyond. Our inaugural feature celebrates the incredible talent of Deepika 
Varadarajan, an accomplished classical singer versed in both Carnatic and 
Hindustani styles. Her story transcends mere musical skill, unfolding as 
an evocative narrative of passion, relentless determination, and artistic 
growth, all interwoven with the vibrant threads of India's profound musical 
heritage.
Transitioning to a narrative that is both captivating and thought-
provoking, we introduce an insightful feature by J. Kumar Babu, an ex-
leader of the LTTE. This article, diligently documented by our reporter 
from Babu's personal account, sheds light on a rarely explored facet 
of our collective history, inviting thoughtful engagement and deeper 
understanding. 
In sports, we feature an in-depth analysis by the esteemed Dr Aravinthan 
Arunthavanathan, our expert cricket analyst, who examines the much-
talked-about resurgence of Sri Lanka Cricket. Is this revival a mere 
fabrication, or is it a reality taking shape in real time? Dr. Aravinthan's 
thorough and perceptive examination takes us through this journey.
A bold critique in this issue dissects 'The Conspiracy to Oust Me from 
the Presidency,' the controversial memoir by Sri Lanka's ex-president, 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Offering a window into the island's recent political 
turmoil, our correspondent challenges you to read between the lines, to 
question and seek the truth behind the political fa√ßade.
Join us as we embark on this captivating journey through a mosaic of 
stories, each enhancing our collective understanding and connecting us in 
deeper ways. Your unwavering support and readership fuel our mission, 
and we can't wait to share these enriching experiences with you.
Warm regards,
