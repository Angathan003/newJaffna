pproximately 67 acres of land 
in the Valikamam North 
area of Jaffna, which had been 
designated as a high-security 
military zone for the past 33 years, 
were recently returned to their 
rightful owners. This includes about 
20.3 acres in Kangkesanthurai 
South, within Grama Sevaka 
Division 235. Similarly, around 
23 acres in Varuthalaivilan 
(Grama Sevaka Division 241) 
and approximately 24 acres in 
Mayiliddy South (Thenmayilai), 
within Grama Sevaka Division 240, 
have also been released.
Many people visited their ancestral 
lands with great interest. Some 
were seen tearfully rejoicing. An 
older woman moved to tears, told 
the Jaffna Monitor that after 33 
years, she could finally see her 
house where she was born and 
raised and where she gave birth 
to her children. Another elderly 
man conveyed to us at the Jaffna 
Monitor that it seemed like a divine

miracle to him to finally see his ancestral 
home. He shared with the Jaffna Monitor 
that, with the help of his sons living abroad, 
he plans to renovate the house and live in 
his ancestral home. However, the house he 
referred to had only a few pillars and walls; the 
roof and other structural parts that constitute a 
house were not there, having been destroyed. 
Another notable feature is a small Hindu 
temple under a tree constructed and 
maintained by the Sri Lankan army. This 
makeshift temple houses Hindu deities such as 
Ganesha and Shivalinga. Its presence starkly 
contrasts the Buddhist temples and statues that 
the military usually maintains in high-security 
zones.
Locals observed that a few houses, formerly 
used as an army camp and as residences 
for army commanders, have been well-
maintained. This is in stark contrast to other 
houses in the area, which are in a state of 
disrepair.
In Jaffna alone, thousands of acres of land have 
been declared part of a high-security zone 
and are retained by the Sri Lankan army. This 
situation continues to have a significant impact 
on the local Tamil population, many of whom 
are either displaced or struggling to reclaim 
their ancestral lands. Although the Sri Lankan 
Army has released some of the land it occupied 
during the conflict, it still maintains control 
over other portions within the high-security 
zone.
