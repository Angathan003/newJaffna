n 'The Conspiracy to Oust Me from the Presidency,' 
the only book by former President Gotabaya 
Rajapaksa, a narrative unfolds that many believe is out 
of touch with the stark realities of his tenure. More 
an assertive indictment than a modest memoir, this 
work directly targets the Aragalaya movement and his 
adversaries. 
Notably, during the height of his presidency amidst 
the economic crisis, Rajapaksa's opposition comprised 
a significant portion of the Sri Lankan populace. He 
describes this opposition as a covert operation against 
his rule. While providing a gripping read, the book 
should be recognized as representing merely one 
viewpoint on a tumultuous period in Sri Lanka's history. 
Embracing the notion that every perspective holds 
value, this book offers an alternative angle worth 
exploring. Nonetheless, the assertion that Rajapaksa 
himself penned the book invites questions about his 
venture into authorship.
The Aragalaya, or the mass struggle, manifested as a 
powerful wave of public dissent, mobilizing hundreds 
of thousands in the streets. Their demands extended 
beyond Rajapaksa's removal, calling for a fundamental 
change in the governing system. Contrasting with 
Rajapaksa's portrayal, many observers, this writer

included, see the uprising as an authentic 
grassroots movement, not a ploy manipulated 
from abroad. While it undoubtedly received 
support and was shaped by local political 
agendas, particularly from parties like the 
JVP, Rajapaksa's characterization of it as an 
'internationally sponsored regime change' 
seems to be a significant exaggeration. 
Given his governance, plagued by questionable 
economic choices, one must ponder how the 
electorate, which had granted him a historic 
victory of 6,924,255 votes just two years and 
nine months before, could have so decidedly 
turned against him.
From Rajapaksa's vantage point, the 
military's restraint during this era emerges 
as a confounding element of the supposed 
conspiracy. He openly questions why figures 
such as Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne 
and Chief of Defence Staff Shavendra Silva 
did not adopt a more aggressive approach 
against the protesters. This allegation hints at 
a realignment within the army, moving away 
from the once-dominant Defence Secretary, 
renowned for leading the forces to triumph 
over the LTTE.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa's political narrative was 
shaped by the 2012 publication of 'Gota's Warâ€“
The Crushing of Tamil Tiger Terrorism in Sri 
Lanka,' authored by his associate and journalist 
C.A. Chandraprema. Detailing his pivotal 
role in the conflict, the book credits him with 
the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, a release that 
interestingly came just before the elections 
where Mahinda Rajapaksa faced defeat.
Sri Lanka's political observers now see his 
latest book as a bid to rekindle the Rajapaksas' 
waning political fortunes. Yet, current trends 
suggest that they should tread carefully to 
avoid becoming fodder for ridicule, a fate that 
has recently befallen the family in social media 
circles.
