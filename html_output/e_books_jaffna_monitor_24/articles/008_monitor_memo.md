n a notable departure from the norm, M A. Sumanthiran, 
an Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi parliamentarian, attended 
a crucial meeting convened by Sri Lanka's President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe. This gathering was centred on the nation's 
ongoing economic crisis and its interactions with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). His attendance was 
significant as he was the sole opposition lawmaker present, 
diverging from the collective stance of major opposition 
parties like the SJB and JVP, who boycotted the event 
in protest against the IMF's stringent reform demands, 
including tax hikes criticized for disproportionately affecting 
lower-income individuals.
During the meeting, Sumanthiran highlighted issues 
surrounding the transparency of the government's dealings 
with the IMF, specifically the non-disclosure of Technical 
Assistance Reports. He argued for their release to opposition 
members, aiming to scrutinize the rationale behind the 
IMF's recommendations.
His concerns extended to the IMF's current programs, 
questioning their benefit to the country's poorer populations. 
He pointed out alternatives to the recent VAT increase, like

adjusting the withholding 
tax, which he believed could 
be more effective for revenue 
generation.
Meanwhile, MP Dr Harsha 
de Silva exemplified the 
opposition's broader stance, 
which preferred discussions 
with bondholders rather than 
directly engaging with the IMF. 
This perspective highlighted a 
nuanced approach within the 
opposition, indicating varied 
strategies towards addressing 
the nation's economic 
challenges.
Therefore, Sumanthiran's 
decision to attend the meeting 
represents a divergent approach 
within the opposition, 
reflecting the complexities and 
varying strategies at play in 
Sri Lanka's efforts to navigate 
its challenging economic 
landscape.
