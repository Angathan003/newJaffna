# "Tamils should accept the 13th Amendment and then work towards securing more powers within the framework of the country."

the government's approach 
was to avoid looking back. The 
government eliminated the 
LTTE leadership and sought 
ways to win the hearts of the 
Tamil people. We also expected 
the same reciprocation from 
the diaspora, but that did not 
happen.
Is there any plan to attract 
diaspora investment to the 
country?
We are not stopping anyone. 
Anyone can come to Sri Lanka 
and invest. Every day, we issue
thousands of visas to diaspora 
Tamils. We are not declining 
them. The only visa we declined 
was that of Canada's Minister of 
Crown–Indigenous Relations, 
Gary Anandasangaree. We 
didn't want to be a tool in his 
political play, which is why we 
declined it.
There are two other Tamil 
ministers in the Cabinet 
with you...
Yes, Douglas Devananda from the North and Jeevan 
Thondaman from the upcountry are both doing 
exceptionally well. Douglas Devananda is one of the most 
diligent members of the Cabinet. He meticulously studies 
the Cabinet papers and comes fully prepared, consistently 
advocating for the Tamil community and all minorities. 
His presence in the government is truly significant.
Jeevan Thondaman has also exceeded my expectations. 
He's a highly capable young leader— forward-thinking 
and deeply passionate about fighting for his people. His 
dedication and vision are commendable.
How do you feel about becoming the face of Sri 
Lanka as a minority Foreign Minister, following 
in the footsteps of Lakshman Kadirgamar? And 
how has your upbringing influenced the person 
you are today?
"Tamils should accept 
the 13th Amendment 
and then work towards 
securing more powers 
within the framework 
of the country."
