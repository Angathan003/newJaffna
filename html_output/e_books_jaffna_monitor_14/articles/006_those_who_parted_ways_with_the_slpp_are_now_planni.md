from the war, particularly through the 
establishment of the Office on Missing
Persons (OMP). As you take on this 
role once again, could you elaborate 
on your plans to further support 
these families, especially in terms of 
compensation and other initiatives
aimed at providing them with the 
justice and closure they desperately 
seek?
Thank you. We established the Office on 
Missing Persons to tackle these sensitive 
issues. According to the data we've collected, 
there were approximately 6,500 complaints of 
missing persons between 2000 and 2009. Of 
these, around 5,750 cases have been brought 
before the OMP. As a first step, families can 
request either a certificate of missing status or, 
if they prefer, a death certificate. We've also set 
up a dedicated tracing unit for those who insist 
on tracing their loved ones.
Compensation is another crucial aspect, and 
issuing the necessary certificates is essential. 
The key here is building trust in the institution, 
which is reflected in the substantial number of
families who have approached the OMP. 
Unfortunately, many of these missing 
individuals were abducted by the LTTE and 
forced into combat, and many may have 
perished during the war. However, we are not 
making any assumptions about their fate, and 
the tracing unit will continue its work as long 
as relatives insist.
How do you plan to address the issue 
of missing persons from the war, 
especially in light of the significant 
number still unaccounted for?
During the last war, more than 80% of the 
missing were abducted and forcibly enlisted 
by the LTTE. In January 2022, when I was the 
Justice Minister, I personally went to Vavuniya 
and interviewed around 10 missing persons' 
parents on behalf of the OMP. Almost all the 
parents told me that their children were taken 
by the LTTE against their will. They all shared 
the same painful story.
During the final stages of the war, around 
4,000 government soldiers also went missing, 
and we have not recovered their bodies. 
Initially, they were categorized as missing in 
action, but later, they were listed as killed in 
action. If we had 4,000 soldiers killed in action, 
it stands to reason that the LTTE suffered even 
greater losses. The vast majority of those now 
listed as missing were LTTE cadres, many of 
whom were abducted and forced to fight by the 
LTTE, including children as young as 11. We 
recovered many such children who were given 
just two weeks of training before being sent 
into battle.
What percentage of the relatives of 
missing persons have approached the 
OMP?
"Those who parted ways with the SLPP are now 
planning to form a new party and establish an 
alliance to face the upcoming elections, aiming to 
have it ready before the presidential election."

Out of 6,500 cases, approximately 5,750 have 
come to the OMP, which translates to about 
90%. This high percentage reflects the great 
faith people have in our institution. The OMP 
is based in Kilinochchi, where the chairman 
and team are actively engaging with families 
who have lost their loved ones.
Minister Douglas Devananda has 
suggested that the government's 
compensation of 2 lakhs is inadequate 
and has called for it to be increased 
to one million rupees. What is your 
perspective on this proposal?
Yes, we are considering that proposal. Given 
that it's been over a decade since the end of the
conflict, it's appropriate to revisit the 
compensation amount. While I'm not sure of 
the exact figure yet, we must certainly look 
into increasing it to offer something more 
substantial, depending on our capacity to pay.
As the Finance Minister, you played 
a crucial role in initiating talks with 
the IMF. Could you elaborate on the 
current steps and the progress being 
made?
The discussions with the IMF have been 
progressing well. We've successfully secured 
the first, second, and third tranches and are 
now preparing for the fourth. We must adhere 
strictly to the IMF program. If we don't stick 
to the program and attempt to renegotiate 
or make changes along the way, the IMF will 
halt their payments. If that happens, it won't 
just be the IMF withholding funds; the Asian 
Development Bank and the World Bank could 
follow suit. This would jeopardize around $1.2 
billion in funding expected towards the end 
of this year and early next year, which would 
create significant challenges for the Sri Lankan 
economy.
It's important to note that this is our 17th time 
engaging with the IMF, and historically, we've
struggled to see these programs through to 
completion. This time, it's crucial that we stay 
the course and complete the program without 
abandoning it halfway. If we manage to do this
successfully, Sri Lanka could emerge from this 
cycle once and for all, and we may not have to
turn to the IMF for assistance in the future.
As a national list MP of the SLPP, 
you're often seen as having been 
brought into politics by the Rajapaksa 
brothers. Now, your party is putting 
forward Namal Rajapaksa as a 
presidential candidate, yet you and 
the majority of the SLPP are siding 
with the incumbent President, Ranil 
Wickremesinghe. Do you feel a moral 
dilemma in opposing Namal?
In politics, there are three priorities that 
should guide your actions: first, the country; 
second, the party; and third, personal interests. 
For me, the country's needs must always take 
precedence over the party's. Right now, our 
focus must be on who is best equipped to steer 
Sri Lanka out of its economic challenges and 
ensure stability.
It's clear that among the potential candidates, 
Ranil Wickremesinghe possesses the necessary
experience and proven ability. He has 
demonstrated this not once but twice. In 1999, 
when Sri Lanka faced its first recession since 
independence, he took charge and led us back 
to growth.
