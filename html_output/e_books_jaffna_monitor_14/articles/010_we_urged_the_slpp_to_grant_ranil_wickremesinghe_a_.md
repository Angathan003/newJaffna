of Islam they want to follow. If you want to 
encourage a particular tradition, it has to be 
done through engagement and effort, not 
by imposing laws. History has shown that 
whenever something is forced, it tends to fail—
that's the reality.
The Sri Lankan government recently 
apologized for the forced cremation of 
COVID-19 victims, and some say you 
were the architect behind this apology. 
Did you influence the government to 
apologize to the Muslim community?
I was against the forced cremation policy 
from the very beginning. In fact, it wasn't just 
Muslims who were cremated against their 
wishes—anyone who died from COVID-19 
was cremated, regardless of their religious 
beliefs. There are sects within both the Tamil 
and Sinhala communities that also oppose 
cremation. The government issued an apology 
to the families of those whose loved ones were 
forcefully cremated.
We also enacted a new law ensuring that 
individuals have the right to choose burial or 
cremation unless the WHO imposes specific 
restrictions.
What specific incidents or experiences 
drove you to amend the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA), and how were you 
able to achieve these changes despite 
resistance?
Two incidents particularly shocked me and 
fueled my determination to amend the PTA. 
Before the Amendment, anyone arrested under 
the PTA couldn't apply for bail even after 50 
years unless the Attorney General granted 
permission. The new Amendment now allows 
for a bail application after one year.
The first incident that shocked me occurred in 
Vavunathivu, where Zaharan's terrorist group
killed a policeman. However, the police 
arrested two former LTTE guards and detained 
them under the PTA. They were imprisoned 
for three years, and the police even extracted 
confessions from them. When Zaharan's 
brother was later arrested, it was revealed that 
his group was responsible for the crime.
Another incident involved a hand grenade 
found at Lanka Hospital (formerly Apollo) in
Narahenpita. Two youths were arrested 
and detained under the PTA. It was later 
discovered that the doctor arrested in 
connection with the hand grenade incident at 
All Saints' Church in Borella was the one who 
placed the grenade in the hospital. Yet, before 
this revelation, those innocent Tamil youths 
spent two years in jail under the PTA.
These cases deeply disturbed me, and I spoke 
with then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 
arguing that in this day and age, it's a 
grave injustice for innocent youths with no 
connection to a case to be jailed under the 
PTA without even being able to go to court. He 
agreed with me, and we moved forward with 
amending the PTA. I was able to achieve this 
because I was part of the government and the 
Cabinet as Justice Minister.

There are politically motivated groups that 
constantly criticize those of us who choose 
to work with the government. I chose to be 
part of the government, which led to the 
Amendment of the PTA and numerous other 
initiatives that benefit minority communities. 
However, both Tamil and Muslim leadership 
often prefer to keep problems unresolved so 
they can exploit these issues for political gain 
rather than work toward genuine solutions.
This divisive mindset needs to be challenged 
and put to an end.
In this context, I really admire the upcountry 
Tamils. A section of their leaders is with the
government, while another section is with 
the opposition. This way, they can raise their 
voices regardless of who comes to power. 
Unfortunately, Tamils and Muslims don't 
do this. Rishad Bathiudeen was introduced 
to politics as an alternative to the Muslim 
Congress, but now both are in the same camp. 
It's ridiculous.
