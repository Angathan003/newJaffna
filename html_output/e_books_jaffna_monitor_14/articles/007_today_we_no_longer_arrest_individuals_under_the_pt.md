Then, in 2022, when Sri Lanka faced an 
unprecedented economic crisis, he played 
a pivotal role in turning things around. The 
progress we've seen from where we were then 
to where we are now speaks for itself. He is a 
tried and tested leader, and when such a leader 
is available, it is our duty to support him. This 
is not the time for experiments.
With this perspective in mind, we strongly 
opposed the SLPP's decision to put forward 
another candidate. We urged the party to grant 
Ranil Wickremesinghe a further five-year term 
to consolidate the economy. Unfortunately, 
our voices were not heeded within the party, 
leaving us with no choice but to take this 
stance.
Is it true that the SLPP leaders backing 
Ranil Wickremesinghe are planning to 
start a new party?
Yes, about 90% of the leaders have parted 
ways with the SLPP to support Ranil  
Wickremesinghe. With the presidential 
election approaching and the need to prepare 
for the subsequent parliamentary election, we 
recognize the importance of having our own 
party. We are, therefore, planning to form a 
new party and establish an alliance to face the 
upcoming elections.
So, you're forming the party before the 
presidential election?
Yes, that's the plan.
You mentioned that your voice wasn't 
heard within the SLPP. Who ignored 
your concerns?
It appears that a small group, likely those in the 
political committee or similar bodies, were
making all the key decisions. Out of 128 
SLPP members of parliament, only 16 were 
included in the decision-making process. 
These members were selected and appointed 
without broader consultation. While the party 
constitution might grant them the authority 
to do this, it becomes problematic when they 
fail to consult cabinet ministers, parliamentary 
members, or even the party's organizational 
structure at the district and electoral levels. 
When such essential voices are excluded, the 
entire process becomes flawed. As a result, we 
had no choice but to resist.
Who was responsible for this? Can we 
say it was the Rajapaksa family?
There's no need to single out anyone 
specifically. However, the party's decision-
making process has been concentrated within 
a small group. They formed a committee 
of 82 members, but only 16 of them were 
parliamentary members. We were excluded 
from this committee. Usually, a political party 
would consult its executive committee, then 
the district-level organizations, and finally the 
parliamentary group before making crucial 
decisions. But in this case, decisions were
made by a select few, a so-called "kitchen 
cabinet." This approach doesn't reflect the 
aspirations of the people or the majority of the 
party members.

And, in your opinion, what are their 
true intentions?
They want to maintain control of the party for 
themselves.
But, the Rajapaksa brothers brought 
you into politics, which was an 
unfamiliar territory for you. Given this 
context, some in the general public 
might feel that you should remain loyal 
to the Rajapaksa brothers. Is that the 
case?
