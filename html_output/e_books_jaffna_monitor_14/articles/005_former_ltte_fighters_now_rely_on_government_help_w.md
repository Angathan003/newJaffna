O
n the day Ali Sabry was reappointed as Justice Minister, we 
had the opportunity to sit down with him in his Colombo office 
for an in-depth interview. Sabry's journey is notable not just 
for his legal acumen, but for his rise from Sri Lanka's minority 
Muslim community to some of the highest echelons of power—a 
remarkable feat, especially in the wake of the systemic challenges 
faced by his community following the Easter attacks.

As one of the country's most prominent 
lawyers, Sabry has long been recognized 
for his ability to navigate complex 
legal terrains. Now, as the Foreign 
Minister, he represents Sri Lanka on 
the global stage, embodying the nation’s 
face in international diplomacy. Our 
conversation delved into the multifaceted 
roles he plays and his perspectives on 
the challenges and opportunities that 
lie ahead for Sri Lanka. Below are key 
excerpts from our discussion, offering 
a glimpse into the mind of a leader 
who continues to shape the country’s 
direction amidst complex dynamics.
Congratulations on your reappointment 
as Justice Minister. During your 
previous tenure, you made significant 
strides in addressing the concerns of 
Tamil families with missing loved ones
