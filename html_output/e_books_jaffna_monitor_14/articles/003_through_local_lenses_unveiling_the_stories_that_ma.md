Through Local Lenses: Unveiling 
the Stories that Matter
Dear Readers,
In this edition, we feature a timely interview with Ali Sabry on 
the day of his reappointment as Justice Minister. Conducted in his 
Colombo office, this conversation offers a nuanced exploration of 
Minister Sabry's perspectives on the challenges and opportunities 
that lie ahead for Sri Lanka. Having navigated significant 
hurdles throughout his career, Minister Sabry shared his thoughts 
on the various roles he has undertaken, including his current 
responsibilities on the international stage as Foreign Minister.
We also present a detailed article by our special correspondent on 
the unfolding drama surrounding the Tamil Common Candidate. 
Titled "From East to Least: The Common Tamil Candidate 
Comedy Starring Ariyanethiran," the piece critically examines the 
recent political manoeuvring within the Tamil People's Assembly. 
It delves into the irony and contradictions of their candidate 
selection, providing a candid analysis of how these developments 
may impact the Tamil community and the broader political 
landscape in Sri Lanka.
This issue is filled with a rich variety of insightful content and 
compelling narratives that truly capture the pulse of our region. 
Despite the delay, we hope this edition continues to provide the 
depth of insight and engagement you've come to expect from 
the Jaffna Monitor. Our mission remains to reflect the voices 
and concerns of our community, offering a platform for the most 
important discussions. We deeply appreciate your patience and
