uring a recent media conference at his 
office in Kalviyankadu, Jaffna, C.V.K. 
Sivagnanam, Chairman of the Northern 
Provincial Council and senior vice-president 
of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK), 
outlined his cautious stance on the upcoming 
presidential election. Reflecting on a recent 
central committee meeting of the ITAK, he 
highlighted a rather inconvenient pattern: 
candidates backed by Tamil parties, especially 
the ITAK, have consistently faced defeat.
Sivagnanam explained, "Whenever we throw 
our weight behind a candidate, it sparks 
propaganda in the South, accusing the 
candidate of selling out the country for Tamil 
interests, which often seals their fate. A case 
in point is Sajith Premadasa's recent visitâ€”
barely a day after he met with us, the racist 
rhetoric in the South went into overdrive."
He pointed out the dilemma of endorsing 
a candidate, only to be left out in the cold 
if they lose, making future negotiations 
awkward.
Sivagnanam also urged the party to refrain 
from endorsing a specific candidate, 
emphasizing that voting remains a 
democratic right and should not be 
boycotted. He added that the central 
committee would reconvene on the 18th, 
though reaching a unanimous decision 
seemed unlikely. "But, of course, in politics, 
you never know until the final bell rings," he 
added with a smile.
