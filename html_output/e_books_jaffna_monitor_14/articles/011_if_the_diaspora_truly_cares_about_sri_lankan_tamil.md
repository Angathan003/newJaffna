But there are still people detained 
under the PTA.
Yes, that's true. Under the previous PTA 
provisions, individuals arrested had to remain 
in jail until their cases were completed, as 
courts couldn't grant bail. Detainees had no 
option for bail,  relying only on a presidential 
pardon. We released 27 PTA detainees, 
including one of the masterminds behind the 
Central Bank attack—though this is rarely 
mentioned. We also amended the PTA to allow 
bail applications after one year, which was 
previously impossible. Those still in jail under 
the PTA have ongoing court cases. We are 
addressing this issue systematically. If the
courts decide to release them, they will 
be released. Today, we no longer arrest 
individuals under the PTA unless they have a 
direct connection to terrorism. People aren't 
detained under the PTA for holding a picture 
of Prabhakaran or expressing support for the 
LTTE anymore.
What is your opinion about the Tamil 
common candidate?
This is an unwise move. What change can 
a Tamil common candidate possibly bring? 
Can they even garner a few thousand votes? 
This is nothing more than a farce, a charade. 
If they genuinely care about the Tamil people, 
they should support a winnable candidate or 
at least back someone they believe should be 
in the opposition. You don't always have to be 
in power, but this so-called Tamil common 
candidate will only serve to widen the 
divide between Tamils and Sinhalese. Those 
promoting a Tamil common candidate are 
fully aware that they can't win, and therefore,
they won't offer any real solutions to Tamil 
issues. They are simply searching for problems.
Opportunistic Tamil politicians once 
demanded a separate country, leading to a 
brutal war that consumed two generations. But 
what did they achieve? 
A pragmatic Tamil leader should have sought a 
solution within the framework of the country,
advocating for a power-sharing arrangement 
that ensures the dignity of the Tamil people. 
Even though I don't support federalism, Tamils 
have the right to advocate for it within Sri 
Lanka.
Minorities indeed have issues and should voice 
their concerns and fight for their rights.
However, this must be done within the 
framework of the country. 
This entire Tamil common candidate exercise 
is nothing but a replay of the Vaddukoddai 
Resolution, where those who declared it fled 
the war and now have their children thriving 
abroad in prominent positions. Meanwhile, it 
was the innocent Tamil youth who died due to 
the systematic indoctrination by Tamil leaders. 
They seem determined to recreate the scenario 
of 75 years ago, misleading the next generation 
and driving them to die for a cause while they 
live prosperously.

and you'll see that the youth 
who fought for the LTTE 
live in abject poverty. Who is 
supporting them financially? 
It's the government that
provides them with 7,500 
rupees per month as 
disability assistance.
Many former fighters have 
told me that they survive on 
the small aid the government 
provides. They fought against 
the government for 20 years, 
only to end up relying on the 
small help it offers. Where 
is the so-called powerful 
diaspora? Why can't they 
help? If the diaspora truly 
cares about Sri Lankan 
Tamils and the former 
fighters, they should help 
them directly if they don't 
trust the government. We are 
not creating any hurdles.
What is your request to 
the Tamil diaspora?
Just like some of our Tamil 
politicians, the diaspora also 
doesn't want these problems 
to be resolved because it 
allows them to continue 
applying for asylum in 
foreign countries and
profiting from the situation. 
The majority of the diaspora 
knows they can't create a 
separate
country, but they also know 
that by constantly stirring the 
pot, they can amass wealth.
What happened to the Tamil people in 1983 was an undeniable 
injustice, and nothing can justify it. However, it's crucial 
to understand that we cannot remain stuck in 1983. The 
diaspora, however, seems frozen in that time. Since then, many 
significant changes have taken place— provincial councils 
have been established, district councils have come into 
existence, and Tamil has been recognized as one of the national 
languages. Positive progress has been made. Now, whenever an 
injustice occurs against the Tamil people, it is often the Sinhala 
community that is  the first to raise their voices against it. Yet, 
the diaspora remains disconnected from the reality in
Sri Lanka, both in terms of distance and understanding of 
current events.
I want to tell the diaspora that what you're doing is not helping 
anyone. You are dividing people and perpetuating conflict. 
If you genuinely care about the Tamil people, come and help 
them. We  have rehabilitated 12,197 former LTTE cadres,
