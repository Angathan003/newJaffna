But to be fair, from the perspective of the 
Muslim community, apart from those 
involved in the Easter Sunday attacks, the vast 
majority of Muslims supported the Sri Lankan 
authorities and provided crucial information. 
No one collaborated with or supported those 
murderous thugs and terrorists. The Muslim 
community stood with the government of Sri 
Lanka.
For instance, information about Zaharan's 
brother and his associates came from Muslims. 
Similarly, the tip-off about a female terrorist in 
Mawanella came from her own parents. These 
examples show that the Muslim community 
has been actively supporting efforts to counter 
terrorism.
It's crucial in any country to bring minority 
communities into the confidence of the 
majority and work together. The most valuable 
information often comes from within the 
community itself. If there is any radicalization 
among Muslim youth, it's easier for the 
Muslim community to identify and address it 
than for outsiders to do so.
This is why it's important to approach this 
issue as Sri Lankans, working together to 
create a  country that is safe and prosperous for 
all its people.
There is a belief that extremist Islamic 
sects like Wahhabism should not be 
allowed in Sri Lanka. What is your 
view on this?
If we try to ban something forcefully, it 
often leads to its growth instead. This is a 
simple truth, and we've seen it unfold in our 
own country. Take, for example, the 1980s, 
when the government introduced the 6th 
Amendment, believing that expelling the 
TULF from Parliament would cause the Tamil 
struggle to subside. But what happened? The 
government's decision to suppress the TULF 
only pushed the Tamil struggle further toward 
extremism.
Similarly, in 1983, leftist parties like the JVP 
were not involved in the pogrom unleashed 
against the Tamil community. These parties 
were not racist, yet the government banned 
the JVP, claiming they were involved in 
the violence. The government thought that 
by banning the JVP, they could prevent its 
resurgence and halt its political activities 
entirely. But what happened? The JVP 
reemerged stronger than before, transforming 
into an armed movement within a few
years.
The lesson here is that you can't simply ban an 
ideology and expect it to disappear. It will find
other ways to spread. Instead of banning, 
we should give these groups leadership 
responsibilities, guiding them to operate 
legally, openly, and transparently. If they cross 
the line, they should be held accountable. I 
don't support the concept of banning because, 
in reality, it doesn't work. Instead, we must 
engage with these groups, closely monitor 
them, and set clear boundaries. When those 
boundaries are crossed, we must step in and 
take appropriate action.

There are also claims that Sri Lankan 
Muslims distancing themselves from 
the traditional Islamic sect, Sufism, is 
contributing to radicalization. Would 
you agree with this?
I don't fully agree with that. Times have 
changed, and the younger generation is very 
different from ours. When I was a child, if my 
father instructed me to do something, I did it 
without question. But I can't expect the same 
from my son—he will definitely ask for the 
reasons behind anything before following it.
Sufism is a positive tradition but has largely 
been based on practice rather than deep study. 
It has been more of a cultural aspect for the 
older generation, who were content to follow 
it without questioning. However, the younger 
generation isn't satisfied with just following 
practices—they ask questions like, "Why 
should I follow this? How are these practices 
connected to Islam?" They seek understanding.
If we were to insist that everyone practice 
Sufism, very few would comply. Religious 
freedom isn't just about allowing people 
to follow different religions; it also means 
allowing them the freedom to choose 
within their religion. You can't force a 
particular practice or belief. Just as there 
are different sects within the Sinhala and 
Tamil communities, Muslims should have 
the freedom to choose which denomination
