It's a great privilege to serve as a minority 
Foreign Minister, following in the footsteps of
Lakshman Kadirgamar. I am, in many ways, a 
product of Sri Lanka's free education system. 
In the truest sense, the people of Sri Lanka 
funded my education through their tax money. 
I studied at Kalutara Muslim Central College, 
a government school, for 10 years in Sinhala 
medium.
My father, M.S.M. Uvais, was a staunch leftist. 
He held no trace of racism, and he raised me
with the same values. I vividly remember a 
time in my childhood when I made a general
statement against Tamil people during 
a conversation. My father asked which 
newspaper I had read, and when I mentioned 
the name of a hardline Sinhala newspaper, he 
advised me to broaden my perspective. He 
encouraged me to read Tamil newspapers, 
English newspapers, and Sinhala newspapers 
to understand different viewpoints. He 
explained that Tamil newspapers focus on
Tamil issues, Sinhala newspapers on Sinhala 
issues, and English newspapers tend to offer a 
more balanced view. He taught me to read all 
three and then form my conclusions.
As a lawyer, I've been fortunate enough to earn 
well. I have a good home, some assets, and a
decent bank balance. I've sent my sons to study 
at top universities around the world. My elder
son graduated from the USA, and my second 
son is heading to the UK for his studies. I have 
one more son, and I'm confident that I can 
provide him with a top-class education as well. 
So, what more do I need? I believe it's time to 
serve my country. The most important thing 
for me is to make a meaningful difference in 
Sri Lanka. I could easily settle abroad, but 
what will happen to the 22 million people of 
Sri Lanka? This question drives me. I want to 
contribute to my country, bring about peace, 
and see Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims live 
together in harmony like brothers and sisters. 
Achieving that requires hard work.
I am a devout Muslim, though I don't make it a 
point to advertise it. I have never smoked, nor
have I ever tasted alcohol. I follow the 
principles of my religion because, for me, 
religion is about personal development 
and the relationship between oneself and 
God. It's not about imposing your values on 
others, and Islam itself teaches that there is 
no compulsion in religion. You can't force 
people to follow a religion. At the same time, 
it's important to support diversity. I've realized 
that different things matter to different people. 
For Muslims, it's their religionâ€”if you touch 
their religion, they feel deeply hurt. For 
Tamils, their culture and language are crucial. 
The territorial integrity of the country is of 
utmost importance to the Sinhalese. We need 
to understand these differences and work 
accordingly. Not everyone can do everything, 
but everyone can do something. I try to do 
my part in promoting peace, just as my father 
taught me.
