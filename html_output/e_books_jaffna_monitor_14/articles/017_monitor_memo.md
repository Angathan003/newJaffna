M
ano Ganesan, leader of the Tamil 
Progressive Alliance, has warned sternly 
about the push for a Tamil common candidate 
in the upcoming elections. "Keep this issue 
within the Northern and Eastern provinces; do 
not bring this demand outside of those areas. 
If it is brought outside, we will oppose it," he 
declared.
Sharing his thoughts on the matter, Ganesan 
added, "I had hoped the Tamil common 
candidate would be someone new, a fresh face. 
But it turns out we're getting the same old 
candidate. While I'm not officially opposing 
this attempt, it's clear that the Tamil nationalist 
parties have the right to nominate such a 
candidate, and the parties in those areas have 
the right to oppose it. We recognize both the 
opposition and the support for this initiative."
He continued with a cautionary note: 
"However, we are saying, do not bring that 
slogan outside the Northern and Eastern 
provinces. If that happens, we cannot accept 
it because it will not be a favourable matter 
for the people living outside of those regions." 
Interestingly, Ganesan did not elaborate 
on how this common Tamil candidate is 
beneficial for those within the Northern and 
Eastern provinces.
Adding a twist to the plot, Ganesan noted 
the rumours swirling in Colombo, "There 
have been accusations that President Ranil 
Wickremesinghe is behind the Tamil common 
candidate initiative. Now, I didn't say this—it's 
just what some media outlets are reporting," 
he said, leaving room for the reader to ponder 
who's really pulling the strings behind the 
scenes.

faces the monumental task of restoring 
stability and steering the nation toward new 
elections after weeks of violent upheaval. The 
84-year-old, often hailed as the "banker to 
the poor," was selected to lead the interim 
administration following a wave of student 
activism and civil society mobilization against 
Hasina's increasingly autocratic rule. What 
began as protests against a controversial 
job quota system swiftly morphed into a 
nationwide demand for the prime minister's 
resignation, culminating in a violent 
crackdown that tragically claimed the lives of 
over 300 people, predominantly students.
The scenes in Dhaka on the day of Hasina's 
escape could have been mistaken for a rerun 
of Colombo's chaos from two years ago. As 
demonstrators stormed her official residence, 
they wasted no time channelling their inner Sri 
Lankan protesters—holding mock meetings in 
the meeting rooms, sampling the snacks in the 
official quarters, and even taking a power nap 
in the prime minister's bed. It was déjà vu with 
a dash of rebellion.
However, a stark contrast exists in this 
otherwise uncanny similarity: the death toll. 
While Sri Lanka's protests, despite incidents of 
arson and violence against ruling party MPs 
and ministers, remained largely bloodless—
with no live bullets fired during the three 
months leading to Rajapaksa's resignation in 
July 2022—the crackdown in Bangladesh was 
brutal. Over 400 people were killed in just two 
weeks, including nearly 100 on the penultimate 
day of Hasina's departure alone.
Yunus took the oath of office at the presidential 
palace in Dhaka, with President Mohammed 
Shahabuddin—elected unopposed in 2023 
under Hasina's Awami League—administering 
the ceremony. Yunus now leads a 16-member 
interim Cabinet, which notably includes two

student protest leaders who played pivotal 
roles in the uprising. The composition of the 
Cabinet reflects the outcome of negotiations 
among student leaders, civil society 
representatives, and the military, underscoring 
the broad coalition that has come together 
to steer Bangladesh through this critical 
transitional period.
From Nobel Laureate to Interim Leader
Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize 
for his pioneering work in microcredit and 
has long been a vocal critic of Sheikh Hasina's 
leadership, was in Paris for the 2024 Olympics 
when student leaders urgently summoned 
him back to Bangladesh to head the interim 
government. Upon his arrival in Dhaka, Yunus 
made it clear that his immediate priority 
was to restore order and unify the nation. 
"Bangladesh is a family. We must unite it," he 
declared. Acknowledging reports of targeted 
violence against the Hindu minority, Yunus 
pledged that his interim government would 
urgently address this pressing issue.
Despite these assurances, tensions remain as 
high as the day we file this story, with reports 
of continued violence and unrest, particularly 
against Hindu minority communities, still 
emerging from various parts of the country.
Hasina's Fall and the Road Ahead
Sheikh Hasina's downfall came after years 
of mounting accusations of human rights 
abuses, corruption, and rigged elections. 
Her government was notorious for its brutal 
suppression of dissent, and the unrest 
that ultimately led to her resignation was 
fueled by widespread discontent with her 
increasingly authoritarian rule. Her departure 
has sparked concerns about the future of the 
Awami League, a party with deep roots in 
Bangladesh's political landscape.

Amid this political upheaval, Hasina's son, 
Sajeeb Wazed Joy, has vowed that his family 
and the Awami League will remain active in 
the country's politics, signalling that the party's 
influence may endure despite its significant 
challenges.
How did the protests begin?
The protests, which ignited in early July as 
peaceful calls from university students to 
dismantle quotas in civil service jobs—one-
third of which were reserved for the kin of 
veterans from Bangladesh's 1971 War of 
Independence—rapidly escalated into a full-
blown crisis.
Critics argued that the quota system was 
inherently discriminatory and urgently needed 
reform. While initial demands were partially 
addressed, the movement quickly morphed 
into a sweeping anti-government uprising. 
In retaliation, Hasina unleashed a series of 
draconian measures, including recurrent 
internet blackouts across key regions, the 
imposition of a nationwide curfew, and the 
branding of protestors as "terrorists" bent on 
"destabilizing the nation." She even resorted 
to using the term "Razakar" to describe the 
protesting students—a deeply offensive label 
historically reserved for those accused of 
collaborating with Pakistan's army during 
the 1971 liberation war. As unrest intensified, 
violent confrontations erupted, resulting in 
the deaths of over 400 people under Hasina's 
directive.
The Seeds of Discontent: Why 
Students Were Enraged
For years, discontent had quietly simmered 
beneath the surface in Bangladesh, with recent 
protests erupting as a visible manifestation of 
deeper frustrations. Although Bangladesh had 
emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing 
economies—propelled by the ambitious

economic agenda of Hasina's administration—
the country's transformation into a global 
powerhouse for ready-to-wear clothing 
exports, worth nearly $40 billion annually 
masked underlying issues.
Hasina's tenure was also marked by significant 
infrastructure developments, including new 
roads, bridges, factories, and even a metro 
rail system. Bangladesh's economic prosperity 
was such that it extended a $200 million loan 
to Sri Lanka during its economic crisis in 
2021. Yet, these achievements were marred by 
widespread allegations of corruption.
According to the World Bank, under Hasina's 
rule, per capita income has tripled over the 
past decade, with more than 25 million people 
lifted out of poverty over the last two decades. 
However, the fruits of this growth appeared 
to be disproportionately enjoyed by those 
aligned with the Prime Minister's Awami 
League. Hasina's pledges to combat corruption 
rang hollow against her own admission of 
dismissing a household aide for allegedly 
embezzling $34 million in state funds, 
highlighting the endemic corruption within 
her administration.
Simultaneously, rights activists had long 
decried the shrinking space for democratic 
expression under Hasina's rule. Her 
government was frequently accused of 
suppressing dissent, gagging the media, and 
silencing critics, often through imprisonment 
or the enforced disappearance of its most vocal 
opponents.

Experts noted that while economic growth 
had surged, it had failed to generate sufficient 
employment opportunities for university 
graduates. Estimates suggested that around 
18 million young Bangladeshis were actively 
seeking work, with university graduates facing 
higher unemployment rates than their less-
educated peers. This growing disillusionment 
among the youth catalyzed their demand for 
the abolition of quotas in government jobs. 
They saw this as an essential step toward 
levelling the playing field and improving their 
chances in a job market that had left many 
feeling marginalized and disheartened.
The Flame of Protest: How Discontent Erupted 
into Nationwide Unrest
What began as a focused outcry against 
the government job quota system quickly 
transformed into a sweeping wave of national 
unrest.
On July 21, the Bangladesh Supreme Court 
moved to scale back the quota system, a 
decision that could have quelled the unrest. 
However, Sheikh Hasina's incendiary rhetoric 
and the ruthless police crackdown only 
fanned the flames of public anger. Attacks on 
protesters by groups aligned with the ruling 
Awami League further galvanized a mass 
movement that rapidly expanded beyond the 
student body.
The brutal suppression reached its zenith on 
August 4, when nearly 100 people were killed 
in a single day of police violence, provoking 
widespread outrage. The very next day, under 
immense pressure, Hasina was forced to resign 
and flee the country, ending her prolonged 
tenure abruptly.
The fury was so intense that even the statues 
of her father, the revered freedom icon Sheikh 
Mujibur Rahman, were toppled and defaced, 
signalling a profound rupture in the nation's 
political and emotional fabric.
The Final Hours: How Sheikh Hasina's 
Reign Came to an End
On the eve of Sheikh Hasina's abrupt departure 
from Bangladesh, as the nation teetered on the 
brink of chaos, a crucial meeting took place 
within the upper ranks of the military—a 
meeting that would ultimately determine her 
fate. General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief 
and a relative of Hasina by marriage, met with 
his top generals. In a significant decision, the 
military leadership resolved that they would 
not use force against civilians to enforce the 
curfew she had imposed.
General Waker-Uz-Zaman swiftly 
communicated this decision to Hasina's office, 
making it clear that his troops would not 
execute her draconian lockdown and shoot-at-
sight orders. The message was unmistakable: 
Sheikh Hasina had lost the support of the 
military, the very institution that had been her 
bulwark of power.
By Monday, August 5, the first full day of the 
indefinite nationwide curfew, Sheikh Hasina 
was sequestered within the Ganabhaban, or 
"People's Palace," a heavily fortified complex 
in Dhaka that served as her official residence. 
Outside, the streets of the sprawling capital 
swarmed with tens of thousands of protesters 
who, defying the curfew, marched with the 
singular aim of ousting the embattled leader. 
Faced with the gravity of the situation, Hasina 
made the fateful decision to resign. According 
to reports, her decision to resign and flee to 
India was driven more by the advice of close 
family members than by her security advisors. 
Her escape was executed just in time—mere 
hours after her departure, the surging crowds 
breached the gates of her residence.

India, which had played a crucial role in the 
creation of Bangladesh out of East Pakistan in 
1971, had long been a sanctuary for Hasina. 
Following the assassination of her father in 
1975, she spent years in exile in India, forging 
deep ties with the country's political elite. 
When she eventually returned to Bangladesh 
and rose to power in 1996, Hasina was viewed 
as more attuned to India's security concerns 
than her political rivals. Her secular stance 
was also seen as a reassuring factor for the 13 
million Hindus residing in the predominantly 
Muslim nation.
Yunus's Legal Battles and Political Frictions
Muhammad Yunus's ascent to the interim 
leadership follows a protracted and bitter feud 
with Hasina. The former prime minister had 
unjustly accused Yunus of exploiting the poor 
through his microfinance initiatives, a charge 
he has steadfastly denied. Their rivalry reached 
a peak in 2011 when Yunus was ousted from 
his role as managing director of Grameen 
Bank by Bangladesh's central bank, an action 
widely regarded as politically motivated.
Despite these obstacles, Yunus remains 
unwavering in his commitment to empowering 
the poor and advancing democracy in 
Bangladesh. His interim government now faces 
the formidable challenges of organizing free 
and fair elections, addressing the widespread 
human rights violations of the past decade, 
and deftly navigating the complex geopolitical 
landscape that involves balancing relationships 
with India, China, and the United States.
