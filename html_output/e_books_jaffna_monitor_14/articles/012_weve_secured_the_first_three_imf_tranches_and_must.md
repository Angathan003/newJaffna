Help them. Create jobs for them. Support 
education. Establish schools, training colleges, 
or vocational education centers. If you don't 
trust the government, help them directly. Help 
the Tamils fight for devolution and respect 
within the country. Work to create a dignified 
place for Sri Lankan Tamils within Sri Lanka. 
If you can live in Canada, why can't you live 
in Sri Lanka? The people of Sri Lanka have 
changedâ€”they are not the same as they were 
in 1956  or 1983. The Sinhala community 
has evolved too; many now believe that 
Tamils should have equal rights alongside the 
Sinhalese. Only a few Sinhala hardliners still 
cling to outdated racist
views. Ironically, it's sometimes sections of 
minorities in Sri Lanka who exhibit more 
racism than the majority. But the vast majority 
of Sinhala people are genuinely good-hearted.
Even in the Cabinet, I worked alongside 
well-known Sinhala hardliners like Wimal 
Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila, and Sarath 
Weerasekera. When it came to making crucial 
decisions, they did not display racism. For 
instance, when we discussed compensation 
for missing persons, the question arose about 
whether we should compensate the families 
of LTTE members who fought against us. 
The entire Cabinet supported providing 
compensation, recognizing that these 
individuals fought for political reasons and 
that their families are now struggling.
The primary concern among the Sinhala 
people is the fear that Tamils might divide the 
country and create a separate nation. I believe 
Tamils should accept the 13th Amendment 
and then work towards securing more powers 
within the framework of the country.
Is the Foreign Ministry taking steps 
to address what you believe to be 
misinformation being spread by the 
diaspora?
They are a vast group, and it's challenging 
for the Foreign Ministry, with only 200-300 
people, to counter all the misinformation fully. 
But we do what we can within our capacity. 
For instance, we played a role in getting the 
LTTE banned as a terrorist organization in 
England, the EU, and most recently, in Canada.
LTTE's brutal child abductors, like 
Kannathasan and many others, later 
surrendered to the military and were 
released after rehabilitation. Why did 
the government not take any action 
against them, given their role in 
forcibly abducting children?
Around 12,197 LTTE cadres surrendered, and 
we did not file cases against them. We accepted 
it as a political conflict and recognized that 
the majority of them were misled. With that 
understanding, we released them. At the  time, 
"We've secured the first three IMF tranches 
and must adhere strictly to the program. Any 
deviation could jeopardize $1.2 billion in funding. 
Successfully completing this program could finally 
break Sri Lanka's cycle of IMF dependence."
